one of the best game music soundtracks for a game i did not really play despite the fact that i have only played a small portion of the game the music i heard plus the connection to chrono trigger which was great as well led me to purchase the soundtrack and it remains one of my favorite albums there is an incredible mix of fun epic and emotional songs those sad and beautiful tracks i especially like as there not too many of those kinds of songs in my other video game soundtracks i must admit that one of the songs life a distant promise has brought tears to my eyes on many occasions my one complaint about this soundtrack is that they use guitar fretting effects in many of the songs which i find distracting but even if those were not included i would still consider the collection worth it,1

great for the non audiophile reviewed quite a bit of the combo players and was hesitant due to unfavorable reviews and size of machines i am weaning off my vhs collection but do not want to replace them with dvd this unit is well built easy to setup and resolution and special effects no progressive scan for hdtv owners suitable for many people looking for a versatile product cons no universal remote,1
dvd player crapped out after one year i also began having the incorrect disc problems that i have read about on here the vcr still works but hte dvd side is useless i understand that dvd players sometimes just quit on you but after not even one year to me that a sign on bad quality i am giving up jvc after this as well i am sticking to sony or giving another brand a shot,0

not an ultimate guide firstly i enjoyed the format and tone of the book how the author addressed the reader however i did not feel that she imparted any insider secrets that the book promised to reveal if you are just starting to research law school and do not know all the requirements of admission then this book may be a tremendous help if you have done your homework and are looking for an edge when it comes to admissions i recommend some more topic specific books for example books on how to write your personal statment books geared specifically towards lsat preparation powerscore books were the most helpful for me and there are some websites with great advice geared towards aiding the individuals whom you are asking to write letters of recommendation yet for those new to the entire affair this book can definitely clarify the requirements for you,0

simple durable fun game for all ages this is an awesome game almost everyone know tic tac toe so it is easy to learn and quick to play you can not play just once the twist is that your pieces are slightly different sizes just big enough to gobble up your opponent the first person to make tic tac toe wins but it not as easy as it looks when you are stuck in the mindset of just making three in a row and forget about the gobbling possibilities my NUMBER and NUMBER year olds will beat me even when i am trying to win excellent beginning critical thinking game grandparents loved playing it with the kids too,1

works great i bought this item to connect to a strobe light unit functions well not sure that it has all the range claimed but i never really believe everything a manufacturer claims about a product like this just too many variables i can say it works from my neighbors house into my garage at least NUMBER going thru two buildings now if i make too much noise later at night he can simply press a button to let me know,1
has no range i suppose if you were going to sit in the same room and have line of sight with the device lamp etc plugged into this control it might work maybe but i had it completely within the stated range and one basic house wall separating me and the unit and it was completely unreliable i recommend spending a touch more money and getting a higher quality product,0
wish i had gotten this sooner i have got a lamp in the corner of my room behind my desk thats a complete pain in the arse to turn on and off i have been using this with the lamp for a month now and it works perfectly added a little velcro and now i have a light switch where ever i want under my desk shelf etc,1
three days of use and it broke very disappointed in this product it worked perfectly for exactly three days and could not be resuscitated it was very inexpensive so i did not want to pay half again the price to ship it back for an exchange so the company would do nothing when they sent me an inquiry as to product satisfaction,0
this is the all time best book this is the all time best book she mentoins in the book how anyone can be a vampire who knows well anyway i like the idea of having one soulmate and one crazed werewolf crush p s i think that it is a good twist on the story about how anone can be part of the night world,1

they watch it nonstop if i let them apart from it arriving broken the first time my kids are loving this dvd which i alternate with the other i purchased to keep my own sanity this dvd has created a thomas fan out of my NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER yr old daughter as well,1
not as expected my children get easily bored with this video i thought it was several episodes of thomas but it has a lot of just children and parents talking about thomas and all it does not keep the kids attention because what kid wants to sit and listen to a bunch of talking this was my first thomas video purchase hopefully the next will have more shows and less talking,0

book of chance i had just finished reading food of love by anthony capella since i had nothing to do but read mind you reading is one of my favorite pastimes i had recently bought a series of books the food of love was just one of the books i just picked up so i can get that for the price of two deal at waterstones in london british equivalent of barnes noble i was not really interested but it was one of the more interesting options i had well i am glad i made the right choice i started reading it last night and i have not put it down since if you love food and a little romance which i am both fond of it an excellent book to read mr capella was remarkably thorough in his description of the rich and textured italian dishes that the words assails you with a sense of smell and taste that leaves you hungry for more this book took me by surprise and i am sure you would not be disappointed,1
light reading light in substance a clich d storyline based on the classic cyrano de bergerac this book reads like a rookie novel written by someone who has a knowledge and passion for italian culture and cuisine but little experience in developing a story i can understand bruno and his passion for cooking but have no clue as to his passion for laura it seems to be primarily based on her being a blonde american how exotic her character is so underdeveloped we know she studying art history and she enjoys bruno cooking with a passion that about it and tomasso he just the clich for any over sexed mediterranean male who encounters foreign females it a light and entertaining read if you can get beyond all of the reasons you should put it down and walk away that being said i will however check out this author more recent novels he does seem to have a way with technical details hopefully his storytelling has caught up,0
weib forever this is a great cd i love weib kreuz the anime is awsome its bout NUMBER guys hhhooottt who work at a flower shop but at night they are the white hunters or byce as in the anime they are assasins that hunt the tomorrow of bad guys the bad guys the police can not get like when teens start blowing up in flames in public for no reason from a strange gas substance that w instant contact ingulfs any object but i could not resist its also an emotional anime at times i think this is a cd and anime any anime fan should see,1
great book unacceptable condition i was looking forward to receiving this book as i was going to new orleans to antoine restaurant i read the book at least thirty years ago and wanted my own copy this book came without a dust jacket and was so musty that i could not read it without my eyes watering i sent it back at my own expense and to date i have not had a refund,0
real html for people who build sites for a living this book is simply great if you build sites for a living you probably struggle with books that trivialize html and present its syntax willy nilly this book is the only book i have ever seen that actually seems to be written by someone who builds sites professionally and wants to know all the markup it explains logical and physical tagging styles well and does a really good job showing how to hook html with other technologies without trying to teach cgi css etc at the same time the only thing i wish is that this guy would write a javascript or dhtml book i buy that right away,1
marriage has its good and bad moments this is a tear jerker mixed with humor a lot of rough patches for this couple but do not let that scare you off because there are also a lot of good times too i watch this movie often as i am a hopeless romantic and i thoroughly enjoy the music and dancing hindi style pop rock mix plus it worth wading through the tears to get to the fun parts it ends the way a typical relationship of this type would but that not exactly a bad thing in this case i recommend it to everyone,1
amazing love it very touch it to bad that in the dvd description does not mention no subtitles,1
leslie in a nutshell danelectro dj NUMBER c rocky road spin speaker mini effects pedal is an amazing little pedal i use it with guitar and keyboards using with keyboards organ mode does not matter which type jazz rock gives me an instant controllable leslie effects it includes fast and slow ramp up boost volume drive thru a mixer in stereo you can do some amazing stuff with this inexpensive unit the only drawback i have found is the buttons are very hard to engage and disengage but i am working on that i will modify the springs if possible and maybe even send a recommendation to danelectro,1
more romance please and less mystery the reason i gave two stars when i usually give NUMBER stars for ms feehan books is b c this book was tooooooo mystery gothic genre rather than romance i really did not feel like the two main characters were in love in fact the entire book was almost entirely from the heroine point of view and i was getting sick of her whining and her point of view unlike the dark series you really did not feel any passion the book is better suited for the mystery gothic genre and not romance even the mystery was not that good its only in the last chapter that for some unforseen reason the villain confesses all in less than three pages throughout the entire book you are kept in suspense of who was the bad guy if you wanted to know who it was look at the last couple of pages ms feehan if your reading please focuse more on the main characters relation to each other rather then distract us with so much unamusing mystery,0
a lost author i have read all of the carpathian novels to date except one i very much enjoyed them at first but nothing ever gets resolved you would think that after NUMBER books something would have been resolved and a new obstacle introduced as for this book it is an off shoot of another carpathian novel about the jaguar line i was hoping to find out more about this curse the origins and why the males kill the females nothing not a word about the jaguar curse and why do the walls and ceilings change ideas introduced and left at that ms feehan went once again off on a tagent her books become less and less meaty and more and more expensive i will not be buying any further books by this author what a shame,0
okay but messy we purchased this bag for a vacation we were taking a cruise and we wanted to use it when we left the ship the bag was convenient to carry however the faux leather began peeling at first it was not so bad but then it became annoying because it then began flaking all over your skin and clothes i would have rather the bag been a cloth bag with no flaking than the faux leather that i had to keep wisking away from my skin and clothes,0
patricia cornwell has turned me into a reader i was never really a big reader before and somebody put me on to patricia cornwell well now i can not put her books down her books just get better and better as you go through the kay scarpetta series i really enjoy the series concept and the fact that some of the same characters keep returning from book to book it nice to see the characters develop through each story line it allows you to get comfortable with them get close to them and get frustrated with them when they do something out of character i highly recommend reading not just this book but the entire kay scarpetta series,1
best of the first four in this series this is an awesome book kay just keeps getting better and better it also fun to see the characters develop more with each book kay herself as she seems to be always one against the world marino who it appears is heading towards some sort of heart attack lucy who seems to be getting more and more quixotic in this book kay finds herself smack in the middle of a series of gruesome killings it appears that a recently executed murderer who kay herself has seen on her autopsy table is still around committing crimes a number of murders occur where the executed murderer fingerprints are turning up kay marino and benton try to track a killer but it appears that the corruption goes up a long ways into the political stratosphere this is a taut and totally believable thriller i can not wait until the next one because the book ended with the way wide open to the next installment,1
great beginning poor ending parricia corwell cruel unusual was breathtaking in the beginning her relation to her family her dedication to her work exeptional however this story began to get boring towards the end the ending not too great,1
NUMBER y o potty humor from NUMBER somethings does not a comedy make saw this movie and felt compelled to warn people not to waste NUMBER agonizing minutes of their lives in a nutshell i have heard many more clever jokes and one liners watching king of queens on cable seriously folks it that bad the bad jokes and the NUMBER references to small jewish penises got old real quick thought i would always be a sandler fan but he clearly adam was in need of some rent money and jumped on this script for the cash and ran why else would the plot line include seth rogan writing for him to put things into perspective this film made bruno look like casablanca,0
i wish adam sandler was not in this i should have known going into this movie having judd apatow a part of it would mean i would hate it however having adam sandler in it and seeing the previews in the theater we gave it a very hopeful chance the movie loses it true premise of having depth in amongst the terrible crude jokes i have to say we did not make it more than NUMBER minutes into the movie before turning it off it is a constant barrage of pathetic behavior i just do not believe that there are this many people out here that are like this and can relate to this behavior very disappointing,0
wonderful baffling mix this has just about everything the rabbi of course is learned and devout even if his schooling causes some nervousness the cat becomes fantastical when some mystery grants him human speech the visit abroad captures all the distrust of the alien that the most insular of small towners can summon and around all of that the monotonous drama of life unfolds loves losses and changes that no one knows how to ride out comics have moved well past the bampow genre into many other idioms this might border on chick lit but much less than some if reality and fantasy remain negotiable for you with deep family devotions and deeper or shallower personal ones the ragged lines of this comic might touch you wiredweird,1
no another grill like this this grill is one of its kind it can be use anywhere without so much hard work it fits snugly anywhere,1
disappointment at it extreme i had never read this author but knew of many who did when i read that this book was being made into a movie it seemed a good opportunity to read her before seeing the screen mess up her work now i pray that the screen does so i was extremely disappointed with this work it is unrealistic fails to capture the reader and at points when i should have been completely engrossed left me struggling with whether i wanted to pick it up i hope she has written better than this or else there are a lot of people who have not bothered reading some of the strong authors available her characters are not sympathetic they do not draw the reader attention and they are dull in overall scope i have too many other good books to read before i pick up another book from this author,0
from potter field by patricia cornwell this was a very good book with excellent descriptions it a real page turner and keeps you wondering what going to happen next the best parts are at the very beggining and the end,1
an engrossing and chilling read my first foray into the novels of patricia cornwell has left me impressed the characters were intense and realistic my only concern is that the evil temple gault at the end of the novel is as vague as he was in the beginning why did he decide to trail and give gifts to dr scarpetta needless to say i will be reading more of cornwell books especially if they are at all like this novel,1
great book i loved it they mentioned a movie where is it the publisher said soon to be a movie does anyone know if a movie was ever created,1
simply awesome this was only my first cornwell novel and i am hooked in the past few months i have managed to collect all of her books and i can not wait to dive into them this summer will be a suspensful one for scarpetta and i,1
predictable has a lame ending i have read all of the scarpetta novels this is not the worst that would be cause of death but rt up there i thought the story began well enough but the ending was lame the plot was predictable lucy is nauseating as ever wish she die scarpetta is still overly materialistic self righteous which has gotten old one of many gripes would be that i find it very hard to believe that all the crime agencies the media have zero knowledge of this serial killer family background close family members like a twin sister my advice do not let this be your NUMBER st scarpetta novel,0
black knight c NUMBER c heat squash racquet great racquet but i am a power hitter i have no power generating difficulty with this racquet my style is to try to volleyball and everything i have found this racquet to well balanced and maneuvered i like the factory grip although with distinct ridges others prefer a smooth grip may give the factory grip on chance and you may come to like it the sale prices are right for a high about end racquet racquets and black knight in have a reputation for overall durability so you should get plenty of use before replacement note i got my first c NUMBER c as a d level player and did not like it immediately howeve as my game improved version i switched from my bandit black knight c NUMBER c white racquet to the great success and have had so it might not be the right racquet for a beginner intermediate to advanced players but will benefit from this fine racquet,1
a historical gem whose title obscures its intent started laughing in the second chapter enjoyed the book after i realized that i was not going to learn anything new it obviously a miracle that we survived for the NUMBER years since it was first published and seeing that the pending insolvency of the us was as loudly shouted in the NUMBER as it is now was worth the price this book had quotes that would shame both modern day political extremes in the us kudos to whoever owns the copyright now there economics in action,0
vastly overrated work of fiction i was sorely disappointed in this vapid and smarmy demogoguery sure back then there was no google searching nor number crunching laptops but plenty of economic data was available which the author managed to circumvent probably the book greatest failing was to compare the field of economics to other sciences even with today analytical resources economists are still all over the map on their predictions conclusions on the other hand meteorologists seem to do quite well naturally the radical libertarians tea baggers republicans love this slim volume which is even slimmer on evidence i would read it only if you want to know why the lunatic fringe is so nutty irrational,0
sergeant frosts lonely hearts club band edith has created a venue for herself to exorcise melancholic memories with painful melodies there are no disguises on this collection lonesome guitars and medicinal piano radiate the mood of broken spirits she writes all her own songs these ballads are definite reminders of those unbearable moments we all have to live they are all gray sky secluded isolating tunes i envision a ironical pace i thought she was from chicago millions and millions of people and she sings stark loneliness,1
great camera i recently purchased this camera and i am very satisfied with it i find the quality of the pictures with this camera as good if not better than anything else without going to digital it is very comfortable to hold and the controls are easy to use i highly reccomend this product to anyone looking for a top quality camera at an affordable price nice going sony,1
had to return it the sizing is perfect and a medium fits just right i am NUMBER NUMBER size NUMBER NUMBER lbs before baby and i gained about NUMBER lbs during pregnancy just an idea for sizing but keepin mind that everyone has different fat distributions on their bodies i do not like how my post baby fat was getting pushed up the top and makes me look like i have back boobs the shape wear crunched up after you sit or bent over and so it does not feel smooth all over squeem makes a vest version too so maybe that one will be a better choice for better coverage if you do decide to purchase this product it easier to squeeze in if you lay on your bed and suck in your guts,0
broke the NUMBER nd time i wore it great until then i think this product provided a great fit i was able to hook on the first row by myself within about NUMBER mins max it was not quite as difficult to get on as i thought it might be although it is not particularly easy either i tried it on and wore for about NUMBER hours and then the NUMBER nd time i wore it had it on for about the same period of time i took it off and one of the metal boning pieces had popped through and was hanging out at the bottom this product is far too expensive to have something like that happen the fit on me was snug but i am sure i had the correct size now i have to figure out how to get this resolved,0
the amazing squeem i love love love the squeem the before and after pictures are definitely real you can immediately tell the difference when you put it on it definitely improves your posture you eat much less since it squeezes the he will outta you but its not an uncomfortable squeeze,1
great product a friend recommended this product to flatten the tummy for great look in a dress i brought a medium according to the measurement guide lines but i needed a small it was extremely difficult to put on so i needed assistance once it was on i was still able to contract my core which meant that i needed a smaller size i believe it is because my waist sits high on my torso other then that this is great buy,1
i recommend ordering a size or NUMBER larger than your regular size i ordered the squeem waist shaper in a size small my general size is NUMBER i am NUMBER NUMBER and weigh NUMBER lbs right now over the winter i ate too much cheese and gained about NUMBER lbs which is not much to complain about but i have a roll of belly fat that shows through a slinky dress i just wanted to smooth out my middle and fat above my hips i wish i ordered a medium or even large instead because as i was hooking the waist shaper from top to bottom as instructed it was way way way too tight by the time i tried to hook the lower NUMBER above my hips i do not want to be uncomfortable i just want a smooth finish so if you are similar in size i recommend ordering a medium instead in general the quality of the product is exceptionally well stitched and built to last,1
waste of money the inner metal rods keep poking through the squeem is a great idea but the construction is not the best while the product compresses your stomach the inner metal spines bend and then protrude at the ends i have had to sew the ends repeatedly but the spines keep poking through at one point the spine developed some sort of crack and when it poked through the bottom it scraped my stomach and i took it off immediately i have never washed the product in the washing machine i have always handwashed it so the manufacturer can not say that i did not take good care of it,0
causes bruising and blisters if worn too long i ordered this product to slim down my stomach i was looking for something i could wear all day with my jeans as well as underneath my dresses i wore the squeem to work occasionally and then i would take it off when i got home when i would take it off i felt sore around my sides and my back i washed the squeem several times and even wore it on the other side thinking this would help but it did not one night after work me and some of my coworkers went out for drinks so i ended up keeping the squeem on for about NUMBER hours instead of my normal NUMBER hours that night when i took the squeem off i had blisters and bruising on my side and back which have now left black marks i am black on my body i read other review before i purchased the squeem and i did not see anything that alerted me not to buy it not sure why this happened but if you read this and it happens to you do not say i did not warn you,0
not happy i was really unhappy with this i followed what others said and ordered based on my prepregnancy size it was way too small at NUMBER weeks post pardum i am ten weeks post pardum and may try it again but it was a real self esteem crusher initially i am a size NUMBER pre pregnancy and so i thought it was fair to order the xs but i guess not,0
nice product my wife loves it but we unfortunately perchaced the wrong size she made a coment about the sizing chart being in dress sizes and she picked the size she is and we received it and the apparel was way too small we have been meaning to exchange it but its tough to get time being as we have new born twins that why she wanted the apparel she was really excited to receive the part and was disappointed when it did not fit,0
does the job i have been looking for something to hold in my stomach that was not elastic based found this item and have to say i am pretty pleased the hooks do take a while but once they are all done the waist cincher does what it says it will do the only negative thing is what a lot of the other reviews complain about it does tend to cause back fat to appear more prominent by your underarms so i can not wear this with a top that is clingy can only wear with looser fitting shirts oh well nothing is perfect,1
conspiracy theorist the author is very likely a kurdish nationalist not implausibly a quite supporter of the pkk as a communist he has no room for religion his analysis is misleading basically he runs after muslims under the banner of islamism he seeks to undermine the islamic religion to satisfy his own psychological needs the author has suppervised the work of others who also claimed to have proved that islam does not work the author does not use objective scientific methods he basically writes in a way that confirms his own priori conclusions read the book if you wish but with such qualifications in mind you may read it to understand how the bigot mind actually works,0
another disappointment from higgins this novella stretched to NUMBER pages by wide margins and double spaced lines reads like a screenplay treatment there is very little character development movie like dialogue and plenty of mindless action the ending is wholly unsatisfying and i am led to believe that this is simply a set up for another book an author with some integrity would have placed edge of danger as part NUMBER of a NUMBER part novel if you are dead set on reading edge of danger do not waste your money the cover price of is an insult and the deeply discounted price will still leave you feeling ripped off go to your local library in the morning and you will finish edge of danger in time for an early lunch just do not expect to have any appetite left,0
NUMBER and thats being generous i have read many of jack higgins books and this is the poorest so far in my humble belief as i travelled thro the pages it just got harder and harder to believe the simplicity with which mr dillon strolls thro the events at hand the story also lacks any imagination and could probably have been summed up in a short story mr dillon is just to sci fi i am afraid there is a quote at the start of the book and as i got near the final chapters i was starting to imagine that the author would be writing the finale of mr dillon the quote read to tess who thinks it about time author i think she may mean something else,0
good matt nude lipstick it got a nice warm scent of vanilla like smell texture is creamy meadow sweet is a nice nude color can not apply too much or else it will look a bit dry,1
i would sell it book complete with dust cover excellent west is only fairly judged by the breadth of his work he has a special view of human nature and all its weaknesses,1
a welcomed change from the frozen plains of europe a refreshing sunwarmed beautifull change from the frozen steeps and plains of ice age europe a delightful story of a woman who must face and overcome immense odds to survive the plot line moves in different ways from other woman against the odds novels so it is a fresh and not predictable a very good read and a much better choice over jean auel shelters of stone,1
where does the novel begin i found it preachy and long and got very bored to claw my way through the very wordy prologue then tried to find the actual novelfinally gave up,0
avoid it the abridged version of this book would read as so sin is inevitable so make the best of bad situations and oh by the way women are strong there ya go nuff said i do not need to read obnoxiously long sentences lamenting on one sentiment for the entire NUMBER odd pages or so of this travesty the entire book is just one big complaint from the girl who commits adultery she laments about it for the whole stinking book and puts up with some obnoxious kid the for whole thing as well painfully thick language stupid storyline quixotic style everything that would piss off a recreational reader avoid it,0
ok this book was recommend NUMBER me from my neighbor but i do not think that dis is dat gud of a book NUMBER recommend i did not like it NUMBER much but,0
the scarlet letter i really enjoyed this book it shows the judgmental tendencies in our human race and how one woman strove to live a life of service to others to gain redemption for her mistake can not go wrong with the classics,1
this edition is not complete this review refers to isbn NUMBER with no explanation or indication that it is doing so this edition leaves out the author introductory chapter the custom house admittedly the chapter is long tedious and skipped by many still it leaves the book useless for the classroom and let us face it who else is going to read it this is not exactly light summer reading in addition there is no bolding of sat words with definitions in the margins that some reviewers mention which was the main reason i chose this edition in fact other than the abbreviated text there is absolutely nothing no forward no reader guide no author bio nothing so not the most helpful textbook on the bright side it is well bound and the type is quite easy to read i am returning the book and looking for a more suitable edition,0
creepy the creepiest book i have ever read it a creepy mystery romance all in one creepy book i would read it again lol,1
a book for those with time on their hands if this book is so great then why are there so many people who give it only one or two stars should a great book not be able to be enjoyed on some level by everyone to the best of my knowledge only erudites and scholars enjoy this book a good book but one with a limited audience do not read it unless you do not mind wading waste deep through overly long sentences antiquicated words and flowery prose personally i like an author who gets to the point,0
painful this book has to be one of the most tedious works of literature ever written hawthorne is a great writer but i do not know how this book made it into that sacred list we call classics perhaps on the merit of his name alone,0
great novel the scarlet letter by nathaniel hawthorne is a great novel it takes place in boston massachusetts during the era when puritans were there the main character hester prynne is forced to wear a scarlet letter a for adultery because she cheats on her husband while waiting for him to come from europe the book really recaptures what puritanism was like its interesting to think about what america would be like if we were still puritan a theme of the book is concealed guilt the minister arthur dimmesdale has concealed guilt which causes him severe pain the message of the book is that you should not let some minor sin you did in the past haunt you for the rest of your life the book denounces the religious atmosphere of the puritan village claiming that it stifled the merriment and joy of the culture of old england you get a picture of how the wonderful culture portrayed in the works of chaucer was lost in america due to the influence of the puritans,1
horrible reader i could not listen to this book because the women reading it has such a screechy horrible voice so i can give no review of the actual book but whatever you do try to find a version with a different reader if you are into audio books,0
mistake i ordered the penguin edition for this book five weeks before my grad class started it was very important to have the correct edition for proper pagination i paid for the penguin edition i got the NUMBER dover thrift edition three weeks later when i called the distributor he told me to email him to remind him to fix it but he did not ask me my name or my order number or anything to identify me from any other customer i asked for an email address and he told me to look on my confirmation email the email address from the confirmation email did not work i had to spend another NUMBER to get the correct edition of the book i already paid more for the book that i got than it would have been worth brand new i will not purchase from this distributor again,0
the scarlet letter much to my amazement this book has been placed on banned lists in several states it an excellent study of the devastation caused by guilt although the story does allude frequently to adultery there are no graphic details that would make it unsuitable for use in a high school classroom both the illnesses caused by guilt and the good health of those who overcome it are made clear,1
the scarlet letter a must read for any american the best book that i have ever been assigned to read for school by far the way in which hawthorne captures the shame that hetser the wearer of the scarlet letter feels everyday and the utter torment that the weak dimmesdale is in by not coming forth and saying he slept with hester and the revenge ridden character of chillingworth is spectactular the way in which hawthorne describes the setting and the actions that characters do is truly outstanding hawthorne has a huge flare for the dramatic which is great for the reader since hester the main character concieved her daughter pearl through an affair she has been snetenced to wear the scarlet a on her chest for the rest of her life the story starts on the day hester is to stand infront of the town and wear her badge of shame and all the drama in the small puritanical town of boston starts from there a must read for any american,1
the scarlet letter a soap opera although this book is considered a great work of literature written to describe the harshness of purtian new england plus this book was heavily laiden with symbolism and many other literary tools the scarlet letter is a soap opera and a bad one at that not only is it boring no true action occurs in this book nothing truly interesting happens in this book this boring work of literature spends an entire chapter describing a prison door although the author did a creative job of conveying his point this is still the worst book i have ever read i would never recomend this book to anyone who can not sit down and read the script to any second class soap opera with out falling asleep after the first NUMBER pages this is a good book to study however it is not a good book to read for pleasure under any circumstance,0
this book is great one might notice that many of the negative reviews of this book contain horrible grammer and multiple spelling errors although i respect those who disliked the scarlet letter i disagree it no wonder that people that do not know how to capitalize the word i thought that this book was wonderful if you are willing to put effort into understanding it,1
i had to read it i had to read this book for school i did not like it i am not sure what the point is of this story several people hae told me what they think it is but i do not agree and they do not agree with each other,0
possibly the funniest movie ever made it starts off a bit slow but once the product placement jokes start it takes off,1
same problems as munchkin version ditto to other complaints will not separate easily either by unscrewing or prizing cheap flimsy leaks water also because no gasket i am looking for something else and hoping reviewers will give honest good advice this almost identical to product by munchkin,0
sassy baby warming dish interesting concept we tried the baby warming dish we found that for our NUMBER year old it was pretty small and did not really hold enough water to keep her warm i think it would work ok for an infant although i think a blanket would work just as well recommendation buy holdsell,1
unreadable as good as this book may be the print quality is so bad that i can not read it zero stars would have been more appropriate,0
used for circuits project i used the generator for a circuits project and it works pretty well with little resistance however the wire connections seemed cheap and very loose i would recommend buying a battery powered one with rechargeable batteries if you are worried about the environment,0
two tedious hours the early success of adam sandler films gave him this mistaken impression that he was an actor and a writer this film proves he is neither and a grating voice over guy to boot i enjoyed happy gilmore and to a much lesser degree little nicky and big daddy but sandler is a one trick pony we have all seen the trick so it just not interesting anymore i thought this might be the one hanukah film in a world of x mas fare it has nothing to do with the holiday and is definitely not for kids,0
one of the worst movies of NUMBER god what a dumb movie the fact that adam sandler can do this is just wrong never lives up to what if true and it down right smells like cheese sick and demented jokes do not help its premise though whitey gets a few lifes nicely animated but a poor outcome think of this as a guide beofer watching it jon lovitz rob schneider and others contribute voices,0
fantastic a movie that makes you feel a lot better about the holidays although not a childish movie eight crazy nights is a fantastic sandler movie,1
very disappointing the movie is vulgar and not meant for children it is a typical adam sandler movie with foul language and raunchy humor not enjoyable at all,0
sandler strikes out NUMBER crazy nights might have been a sweet film with a good message for kids but the scatological humor offensive language and explicit sexual references made it unsuitable for my NUMBER year old the plot on the other hand while fine for NUMBER year olds was too obvious and simplistic for most of the adults in the audience as a result while it probably not the worst film of the year it is certainly in the running,0
not the worst but far from good this film has the dubious honor to be included in the book the NUMBER worst films of all time it is definently not one of those but one can hardly call it a proper film either it is rather a loose framework in which NUMBER new songs could be presented in a more or less natural manner a great great grandfather of music videos and better than some of those,0
been waiting for a foreign lauguage aol cd i have too but this is not it the translation is very choppy the singers are medicore at best and the orchestrations are too overwhelming love changes everything is shredded to the point where it hurts to listen to it oddly the best song is the french chanson i was very surprised as the japanese usually put out extramely good cast cds their cats and phantom and the tokoyo evita are all great but unless you are a total alw or aol fanatic save your money,0
it rises above the fluff books the first thing that struck me was that it was easy to read the print was readable and the illustrations were helpful i did also find some grammatical errors as an earlier review said but mostly it was very specific and practical the chapters most helpful were on emotional states and music it hard to find a book on this subject that across the board dealing with many different issues and this one addresses nearly every brain related research issue from nutrition to memory as a scientist who also works with high school students i found his translation of brain research into the classroom to be thoughtful if not enthusiastic it a tough subject to translate but i did get more than i thought i would out of the book mostly it helped me get past the hype and get into the real practical meat of the material the book far from perfect but it the best i have seen so far on this topic,1
itten the elements of color i was so very pleased to review the art book which arrived in pristine condition i would have rated it in excellent condition rather than very good i would like to thank the person who made it possible but have misplaced her name and address,1
great imo first of all i saw the review by tyley mike relite and thought he was grossly overcritical of everything and every instrument played so i like to hear tyley mike album since he thinks he can do better seriously i think some people do not understand that things sound the way they were meant to sound if they sound poppy they made it that way why the hell should they stick to the norm they want to do something different and in my opinion it sounds great i can not write a good enough review for this album all their albums actually as they are all a masterpiece of their own while still being different enough to keep it interesting it bugs me when a group does not evolve or try new things and stays exactly the same as they ever were all the time so i was glad to see them progress and grow there too much to say to describe this album but frankly i do not think i could write a good enough review to do it justice so i will just give it my NUMBER stars,1
i wish i had never heard fair to midland before hearing this music but can not help making comparisons it is still wonderful music and ill explore it further,1
good follow up to el cielo a bit of a change this time for dredg less progressive material more straight ahead rock tunes i was a little disappointed in it it does not have alot of stuff going on like with el cielo which is pretty big compared to catch without arms but still this is the direction they chose to go in and it definitely a very good one,1
wow this book really bothers me if you are a parent trying to deal with the daily struggles of having a child with a disability do not read this book it does not offer any advice for parents just helps fuel negativitiy please do not put yourself through reading this book if you are still in the grieving stage this book will not help you as parents please try surrounding yourself with positives children with disabilities can bring such joy to your life they can help you learn help you become more empathetic help you become stronger and bring wonderful caring people into your life please remember those things when trying to get through this time in your life do not waste your time listening to a families stories of frustration anger sadness and embarrassment instead surround yourself with positives,0
NUMBER s hard rock one of the NUMBER s rock bands that capture my ears it pity that they are almost retiring soon,1
low class effort by high class band this material represents why the NUMBER died the music is bland and poppy the wilson sister garnered their wigs and corsets and the the music became something of an inside joke to those mentioning real bands looking back at the cd the music is very dated and is caught in an era best left forgotten,0
good quality cell phone holder contrary to other review i found my cell phone holder to be of very good quality and have used it for a long time now with no problems whatsoever,1
loved it i love christmas movies and these are some of my favorites i always bring them out when i am decorating and start enjoying the holidays,1
charlie brown christmas was a great christmas gift i gave this movie to a co worker who loves all the charlie brown classics that are shown on tv she was thrilled when she opened it,1
there is no way anyone with a soul could ever give this a negative review this is one of the sweetest sad funny and actually profound christmas specials ever well maybe not dostoyevsky deepness but there is quite a lot of depth here unlike a lot of modern christmas specials which are just plugs for toys the suits at cbs hated this series they thought it was too intelligent for kids and they did not like vince guardaldi jazz score which is a bonafide classic now it almost did not air luckily it did and we are all better people for it,1
i ought to slug those r movie loving critics they do not know entertainment as krusty would say i do love charlie brown christmas a joy for the entire family young and old a christmas play is being directed by charlie brown and everyone is complaining charlie is sad because he does not know the true spirit of christmas and his friend tells him the spirit of christmas the play was never finished though i like this toon because charlie brown christmas had the guts to tell about gabriel telling the shepherds about the good news that baby jesus was born in the manger i would recommend this to all,1
charlie brown christmas one of my favorite christmas shows of all time great service from the provider,1
proof that good things are built to last when mr schulz and bill melendez decided to launch this half hour special for tv there were many things against the odds the music subject treatment and linus bible reading were unlike anything else tried on tv before work was done in just NUMBER months flat considering the lot of work that goes into an animated feature and a lot of money and resources were put at stake lucky for them and a lot of us sparky hit the nail on the head this film was the absolute winner of next year emmy awards for television for kids programming along with more accolades and recognitions i think the different treatment of the christmas theme present on this film has captured interest across generations and in true peanuts style is something that makes you ponder beyond the obvious one of those films that will never fade out and that are enjoyable beyond the season,1
great christmas gift this is a classic christmas tale and was a wonderful gift i bought it for my friend and she said she will watch it every year,1
yahoo for charlie brown being able to watch something like a charlie brown christmas whenever i want is so soothing to the soul especially since i get really busy around the holidays and can not always catch it on tv,1
the best present of all my children are a little old age wise for this but we all still enjoy watching it around this time of year this classic will never die out as it will be enjoyed for many generations to come having always been a huge fan of charlie brown to begin with this is by far my favorite christmas special i can remember seeing it for the first time like it was yesterday charles shulzz did one amazing job with this classic this short animated special shows children the true meaning of christmas and linus delightful explanation is timeless in its teaching this classic is something that can be enjoyed by people of all ages but especially by families with small children this is just one great video that would make an excellent addition to anyone collection,1
classic watched this with my two year old daughter for the first time this christmas it was nice to watch a classic movie that i grew up watching as a kid myself with her as well as with my hubby the peanuts gang is classic and simple love them,1
not a real rammstein album bootleg collection of b sides remixes and singles really why even bother,0
after a few months broken this charger worked fine for a few months but now charges so slowly that using the computer while it charging drains the battery very frustrating very poor quality,0
works great and half the price this ac adapter works great for me with my apple NUMBER aluminum g NUMBER powerbook apple still wants to charge an insane price for this last generation power supply but luckily macally has a solution that is almost as nice for about half the price it does not light up to indicate that it is charging which is too bad it was a nice touch,1
this is a good product when my mac powerbook g NUMBER cord started going on the fritz a year and a half after i had gotten my laptop i was not sure what to do since the macbook has replaced the powerbook apple no longer sells the adapter and to get the adapter online was really expensive when i found this option i was thrilled it has worked perfectly since the day i got it it is sturdier than the apple adapter and so i feel it will last longer also it is white like many of the apple adapters so if you are worried about the aesthetics of your computer this option is a good one i highly recommend this product macally ps ac NUMBER ac power adapter for apple g NUMBER,1
quite satisfactory this product works well with no problems so far i have now had it for about a month and it keeps my ibook g NUMBER running with no issues it does not have the light that indicates whether power is being received but that a minor thing also does not have the easy to use cable wrapping things on the original but once again that a mere quibble all in all i am satisfied with this purchase,1
great product at a great price a replacement adapter for my NUMBER year old g NUMBER powerbook was going to cost NUMBER from apple the macally adapter is less than half the price and it built like a tank the wires are thicker and the plastic is more durable the only thing you might miss is having the yellow green charging light but that more of a luxury and not a necessity highly recommended,1
excellent item i miss the lighted ring telling you that the charger is charging but for NUMBER NUMBER of the price of apple replacement i can do without it the led is bright and cool bluish color the cable that breaks on apple charger is noticeably thicker on this charger get this you will not regret it,1
off and on its hard to find these types of chargers since mac switched to the magnetic type its hit and miss with the working my battery indicator switches from charging to not in a blinking fashion,0
cheap does not charge dangerous power cord this is one of the most poorly designed and implemented chargers around i own a NUMBER powerbook g NUMBER which this is listed as being compatible with the problem is that this is not actually a NUMBER watt power cord so do not expect to use your computer while it charging and do not expect to be able to touch the brick as it plugged in you will burn yourself i have returned this item and got a charger from another company for just a few dollars more that works a ton better,0
so much better than the apple version i love it it long and the connection is secure and it does not get hot it wonderful,1
good product at reasonable price though the output of this power supply is lower than the apple supply it seems to work fine and it is very reasonably priced too bad that amazon stopped carrying the supply,1
if you are tempted to throw away NUMBER i bought this charger near the end of may of this year and it stopped working about NUMBER weeks ago it is not the same charger as in the picture with the gray cord it looks just like most of the other generic chargers available on amazon it charges quite slowly ibook g NUMBER NUMBER i have a brand new apple brand battery so i do not think it has anything to do with that or the computer from now on i will stick with the cheaper generic chargers until my computer is totally dead,0
plug does not work with the ibook g NUMBER this product is advertised to work with the ibook g NUMBER but it does not this plug looks fine but despite what the product description stats it is not compatible with the NUMBER to NUMBER year old version of the NUMBER inch ibook g NUMBER which i own and now must buy yet another plug for after this one did not work consider yourself warned,0
stopped working day NUMBER out of the difficult to open package this adapter worked for a couple of days i missed the light on the end of the standard apple adapter yellow for charging green for charged but the price was right until it started cycling on and off the mac screen would dim and brighten dim and brighten boy was i glad to notice that the on screen battery light was cycling between a c and battery unplugged the macally computer ran fine on just battery runs fine on the apple charger i had left at home the good news is the return to amazon was extremely easy presuming the lack of destroyed packaging does not void my refund i have ordered a different brand with light this one may have just been a bad example i have had good luck with other macally gear,0
another binchy great this book takes a typical family examines its seperate members and then provides a look at the whole with the knowledge of the secrets each member has i enjoy binchy style of writing interconnected stories that weave together she pulled it off first in lilac bus and now silver wedding,1

deep view of what counts for run and growing an organization i will say that the concept this book adds of playing with future is the utmost importance for many of us who were tough by experience to survive and keep it running the most important thing about work is to get it done if not it equals all us we all lose that does not help a lot any organization this books deals about how to get it done self sustained and fruitfull,1
book only no jacks i bought this book from amazon in used condition but new little did i realize or even think about that it did not come with the jacks and ball now i have to try to find the right size jacks not jumbo ones and a ball i guess you get what you pay for,0
thomas connector tracks the thomas wooden track connector pieces is just what was needed when setting up different designs sometimes when setting up a new design my NUMBER year old grandson whould end up with no way to connect the finish these pieces have helped with that problem,1
plain and simple a journey to the amish this is a very disapointing book the author makes the complexe amish community that forgave the muders of their young daughters at nickle mine school into one diminsional disney characters there is no tension conflict or any of the human conditions that make people real just a oh so sweet group of simple people of course that does not allow us to learn anything from the amish and i am sure there is a lot to be learn from them the author is very self absorbed when she tries to draw any lessons from her time with the amish there were spots where i though o please get over yourself i did not finish the book it was a waste of time,0
disturbing if you are looking for a book on amish theology history lifestyle or agricultural technique look elsewhere a five minute yahoo search will yield you a veritable library of resources compared to this book surprisingly there is ample information online about this oft misunderstood sect of christendom the book did have a modicum of useful information but not enough to warrant the mandatory single star i found the author whining fits pontifications and raging narcissism beyond nauseating it was with great pleasure that i found myself at the last page ultimately this book serves not as a commentary on the amish but rather that of the disaffected yuppie lifestyle the author is from what the author found so utterly alien about the amish was not their anachronistic culture but rather that their of love of god and family exceeds everything else,0
not very good i do not advise buying this grider it broken when i pressed it the plastic is very fragile and do not support the pressure requered for grinding the pepper,0
can not adjust for coarseness the description says you can adjust for coarseness of the salt pepper but there is no such knob on the mini grinders we replaced the store bought salt with sea salt and now the grinder does not work disappointing,0
solid effort but missing a spark statheads and fantasy players know that the value of this book is to be found in its statistics and projections for future performances anyone playing in a long term keeper league will benefit by keeping this near them on draft day as they look for prospects to take flyers on the stats in this book are as good as ever as is the top NUMBER prospect list this edition falls flat in its essays in the past the essays read like great magazine articles that mixed stats and narrative in a NUMBER NUMBER ratio this year essays are far more statitically driven and are written in a NUMBER NUMBER ratio meaning that the flow of the articles is interuppted frequently by data analysis this makes the book far dryer than usual and more of a chore to get through it still invaluable as a reference tool but as entertainment it falls a little short,1
my girl likes it my two and half years old girl likes it so much and every i want to allure her to bed to sleep i will say read i spy in bed,1
still a great book the winds of light books are great this one is no exception but i like the first NUMBER the best the only reason i gave this book a NUMBER star rating is because the other NUMBER were better i would of gave it a NUMBER if i had not read the others,1
i could have spent my money better this book did not move me at all the plot is unrealistic and the characters are shallow they do not seem like real people at all,0
terrific reference for identifying butterflies is that a monarch a viceroy or a queen butterfly to identify butterflies look through the field guide to butterflies of texas the next time you can tell that it was a tiger swallowtail and not a zebra swallowtail or a spicebush swallowtail children are fascinated by insects and butterflies as well teach them to appreciate nature learning the names of butterflies is a good way to start,1
climalite works as intended more visually interesting than plain white and the material is definitely better for dampness than plain cotton but please do not wear them with sandals they are not that visually interesting the bottom black part is thicker but not thick enough to pill or get natty with use you know what i mean thick socks have a way of breaking down with wear the uppers the white and colored part are thin stretchy and breathable flexible enough as well to pull down slightly in the rear to make them no shows if you choose,1
a man of reason at the height of the age of reason the united states of america was created by men such as thomas paine and many others who held man above all other philosophies long enough to get the idea individual rights down on paper in the form of the constitution of the united states of america paine contribution to this end is well known paine noted in this book that we have it in our power to make the world over again and they did man has a right to his own life and there is no law above this no one has a right to another man life not god not the race not the dictatorship not the proletariat not the great society nor the new deal thanks to thomas paine and men like him we have it in writing we own our own life and we are free to dispose of it in our own way let us work together as free men and women to keep our freedom and to spread it around the world to our oppressed brothers and sisters to the glory of man,1

absolutely incredible i was so happy with dolly hungry again and her return to real country i like new country but now it is just like pop music quite a few one hit wonders but dolly parton like tori amos and ani difranco two that came to mind makes an entire album of great music instead of an album that showcases two hit songs if you like folk indie music i think you will love this bluegrass album her cover of johnny cash i still miss someone gave me chills my favorite song is definitely will he be waiting for me this is bluegrass but i definitely like a female singing it it just mellows it out dolly has now put out two great albums and with rumors of her possibly going on tour i could not be happier i am NUMBER have been listening to her since i was little and have never gotten to see her perform live but this album the critics are not just praising a country hall of famer the album deserves every wonderful word,1
has been think again as a child i grew up in knoxville tn watching dolly partin on the cas walker farm home show i remember her singing bluegrass back then and did not really appreciate what i was hearing unfortunately she got away from her roots now she has returned with a brilliantly crafted cd that has critics and her fans screaming her praises dolly voice is perfectly suited to singing bluegrass and shines through like a beacon in the dark the arrangements are simple and understated and the song selection impeccable as a tenneseean i wish she would have included her awesome version of rocky top or at least updated it dolly going to give a lot of fellow artists a run for their money this year at the grammy with the grass is blue and trio ii a top NUMBER cd if i ever heard one,1
band saves cd as usual dolly continues trying to sing but has no voice the musicians are the only good thing about this recording she attempting to sing country songs bluegrass style and it does not work,0
almost perfect cd the only reason i am giving this cd NUMBER stars instead of NUMBER is because it is too short lhasa voice is sultry sad and powerful the music is haunting yet airy perfection,1
the castle in the attic i would recommend this book to any kids who love a great adventure i was on the edge of my seat the whole way through the book i especially loved the silver knight and how he became friends with william go get this book,1
non stop adventure this was a great and is very magical a young boy nanny is leaving and gives him a small castal as a going away present but it turns out that the night that came w the castal is a real night that has been shrunken and turned to stone the young boy breaks the spell that an evil sorcerer has put on the night and goes back to his time to stop the wrong that the sorcerer is doing will he stop the evil sorcerer or will the evil sorcerer stop him you will find out in this incredible story of magic and adventure,1
worst book in the world this was the worst book i have ever read in my entire life i was forced to read it for school it was complicated and very boring i would not recommend this book to anyone please do not waste your time and money to read this book read something else,0
one of my favorites as a kid i loved this book when i was about eight years old and looking back on it it easy to see why william the main character is a gymnast just as i was who rather shy and reserved just as i was but manages when it important to help the people around him he immensely sympathetic and compelling and though the familiar fantasyland and evil wizard ruling a faux medieval kingdom plotline hold few surprises for adult readers familiar with the conventions of the genre it surprised and excited me as a kid re reading it recently i found it did not hold up as well as some of my favorite books from when i was younger such as madeleine a ring of endless light but it holds up better than many this is a strong book for both children and for adults i have a hard time imagining a more perfect book for bed time reading,1
excellent good price excellent design and shipped well would have been better if the vendor also provided personalized engraving,1
best witch book i have ever read spellbinder was the NUMBER st night world book i have ever read i recomended this book to all my friends and i recomend it to you also l j smith is a very talented writer and i plan to read all of her books to come,1
maybe next time i like a lot of people writing reviews play a lot of first person shooters if you liked splinter cell buy traod used i agree with everyone here story is good controls are less than mediocre even enter the matrix blew this game away customizing the keyboard helps some but less than what i expected i tried to leave feedback for eidos but to no avail hopefully if there is another one it will be in beta for a lot longer and for those of you out there who think that it might be my pc i can assure you that is not the case,0
to many issues the story is very interesting and the action and enemies are awesome but the game just has to many technical issues i think they rushed to get it on the shelves asap tech problems are my only quirk with the game,1
lara should have remained in the tomb i was so looking forward to this game being released i was on the internet on a weekly basis looking for a new release date delay after delay i bought the game the day of it release loaded it onto my computer and was ready to play i had one disappointment after another first the controls were different from her other games ok i will get use to the new ones second and the biggest controlling her is virtually impossible she is jerky sporadic and down right slow and awkward i have had to reload the game about NUMBER times to get her to do a simple maneuver i have given up many times in shear frustration frustration i have not felt in her other games i do not think i will continue playing this game it is time to move on and enjoy myself with another game which is what games are all about sorry core and eidos this could be your biggest mistake especially now that the movies are doing so well what a boost this could have been for you,0
angel of darkness is correct this game is the angel of darkness the control system is impossible the menu screens are ridiculous and bulky to manage i have played all the tomb raider games this one is near to unplayable this thing went straight to ebay save your money for something good the tr people need to do something fresh with this character like send her to space or something jeez the franchise is getting old and stale due to lack of innovation and change,0
great work poorly organized kindle book this review is intended as a review of the book not of the work of edgar allan poe as a poe fan i purchased this book just for the pure fun of reading poe on my kindle however the book is so poorly organized that finding a particular tale or poem is a real pain and takes a lot of the fun out of it while there is a table of contents the individual works are not list there rather there are groupings of the works so you have to know or guess to which group the work you may be looking for belongs alas there is also no index this is an electronic book i should be able to toggle down a table of contents to a particular work select it and be taken there but it does not happen that way not recommended for kindle readers,0
this will interest children in insects this would be a great book for use in elementary school science classes it has a wonderful layout with many beautiful photographs if insects can be called beautiful the text mixed nicely with the pictures covers basic information on insects as well as various interesting facts,1
good but only to the midway point this is a wonderful victorian style novel about a manor house its mistress and her domestics wonderful that is until the middle of the story the author makes choices that effectively shut down the flow and pacing of the story it spooky and interesting but the sudden turn and the unexpected switch in the narrator point of view time and setting make the rest of a great read a downer,0
a terrible product this is not well manufactured i recieved it in a timely manner but the product is poorly constructed my husbandand i put it together easily but the cotter key to hold on the wheels are made of flimsy material might as well have been foil and the screws did not fit well i was really disappointed in it do not buy it spend a little more and get a better one hopefully in other words poor design excuted with sub standard parts,0
buyer beware this is the biggest waste of money i have spent in a long time it did not even make it through one bag of leaves i would demand my money back but it would cost too much to send back can not believe amazon still has this piece of trash in their online shopping department take my advice and save your money i would have given it no stars but did not have that option in my opinion it rates NUMBER stars,0
didactic melodrama i have read enough to know when i am being preached to and huxley is unsuccessful in masking his assertions re the human condition in the island i was very disappointed since huxley has the ability to write well even about esoteric subjects see the perennial philosophy for instance but ends up just making a hash of it here not highly recommended,0
well not everything it was a decent book but not a lot of new information for me for the most part it simply confirmed some basics i have long believed in not living out your dreams through your children encouraging exploration without forcing achievement the need to provide for additional means of learning etc a lot of time spent on selecting schools for gifted kids which really does not apply in small towns like we live in some good chapters on different kinds of gifted children and some scattered teaching methods a lot of real life examples stretched across several chapters that in my opinion became a scattered approach probably the most novel idea that came across was that it better to be a good enough parent than a perfect one by klein opinion if you manage to be the perfect parent you set a standard so high that your child will have anxieties trying to live up to your example not sure i am NUMBER with that but it is an interesting take on parenting,0
software is horrible this software is not user friendly the samples do not help i would imagine that if i sat down for a few hundred hours i could figure out were the dots go the whole interface just does not make any sense it very time consuming total waste of NUMBER dollars at the apple store,0
biography of wright and his works easy reading book which i would recommend for those who want a sort of executive summary of the story behind wright and his works having said this i found the depth and detail lacking for those who have read extensively about this architect whose noteriety is growing with time not for collectors unless you like myself want the book to help fill a spectrum of the vast number of publications which continue to come into popular view,0
the top ten list for christians byjames w moore a bit simplistic at times but got some good discussions goingin our sunday school class methodist would recommend itfor contemporary adult sunday school classes or bible studies,1
live it still have this works great my food is kept fresh inside the dome so has a good seal to it,1
elem diff e q while the shipping was amazing the book itself is not much use other than as a list of problems the text explaining the theory behind is written like sandpaper and often jumps around leaving important processes out it would be a very hard book to use as a solo resource w o an instructor leading,0
this is really cool this is a really cool record to own my favorite muffs albums are happy birthday to me and alert today alive tomorrow so i like their later material this hambuger is a lot of early stuff and some later but i really like it i think its cronilogical and its interesting to hear how they have improved with time good cd,1
very disappointing i was hoping that this band would have evolved in some or any degree over the past decade but sadly they have not having the courtney love message on this cd is further testament that this band is tapped out now that kim is in her NUMBER s you think there would be more emphasis to release a breakthrough cd rather than these out takes from the past,0
a carefully constructed read this book is structured such that on all the even pages there are a short pithy quotes that summarize the textaul body of the book on the odd pages the book is written in the style of a manual so that you can dip into it at any point with no need to refer to material that came before the basic thesis of the book is if you want to enjoy life you have to place one hand on the tiller and steer yourself towards the people places and things that you like a way to chart your course is taken from alan lakein how to get control of time and your life which is an excellent book strategies for dealing with misteps are also covered the author tries overtly to avoid religion but a slight christian undertone runs through the book probably unintentionally because of the author and those he quotes cutltural background,1
poor quality and high price are these knock offs i ordered two in cowboy slim cut NUMBER x NUMBER i already had some wranglers the waist was way too small the fly was off to my left in a really weird and very ugly and uncomfortable way these were made in mexico just like the ones i bought at target but the badging was different a rubber badge on the back right pocket not the thin leather wrangler badge at the rear right waist were these knock offs not sure returned them and went to target where i got two pair for NUMBER NUMBER each they were original and legendary gold not cowboy but still half the price pard,0
almost perfect stockings are not easy to find where i live in northern california and i can not stand to wear panty hose i decided to try these stockings that was recommended by the site i used to find a garter belt i really like the stockings they are darker black than the picture depicts them i prefer off black the lace top is a little tight with not too much stretch so if you have large thighs you might not like them the next order i will order one size larger for that reason although i do not have large thighs my husband really likes them and the fact that i like them makes him happy i will buy more,1
not stainless these may look like brushed stainless steel but they are not the magnet that is glued to the back of these is about NUMBER NUMBER and will not hold anything heavier than a very light potholder i tried hanging an apron on it and it fell to the bottom of the refrigerator if you are crafty and can remove this tiny magnet and attach a larger stronger magnet these hooks will be useful otherwise they are not worth anything i guess you get what you pay for,0
the meaning of god the meaning of life both of these issues among others are examined in this simple yet complex story about a variety of characters all of whom we recognize what lies beneath the skin of the average person what do they believe in and why what makes their worlds shatter what would make your world shatter the author never wastes a word entertwining the characters in unlikely but believable ways it a quick read that lingers with the reader to make you think about your beliefs and what you would do for those beliefs to each individual the book could be about god or the meaning of life or simply how you fit into the world this makes the book touching on a personal level i think every reader will find a different way and reason to love this book,1
what a disappointment i am a big belva plain fan and have always enjoyed her books after the fire is a disappointing read what bothered me the most is the character of hyacinth what a weak and stupid woman she is not believable at all any mother will fight to the end for her children i kept hoping she would snap out of it but she never did she just kept trusting stupid men and believing them i will think twice before spending money on another belva plain novel in the future,0
you get what you pay for i was expecting a bigger set so was surprised at how small it was i should have spent more for a better set but it will have to do for now,0
junk do not buy this did not even come with all the screws you could build a better set with twigs skip it,0
fireplace tool set good product got it in a timely manner does exactly what it is supposed to do not too expensive and just as good as the rest of the tools that are over priced the tools work great and have been used a lot this winter,1

long hot summer sweet dream baby by sterling watsonon a sultry summer river two young people explore small town life in the backwater of florida this tapestry of a story mesmerized me with its rich characters and tangled landscapes its troubled families and brooding mysteries if you appreciate musical prose and gripping plots you will relish this haunting book i can not wait for the sequel so i can learn more about travis and delia,1
mathematical nonsense mathematically speaking this book is all nonsense for instance the author argues that owning a home is more expensive than not owning this is true if you compare a person living under a tree versus one owning a home he argues that the person owning a home has a negative cash flow of NUMBER k per year all due to the interest he pays on mortage but the details he left out just to make his useless point is the person who owns a home has a home to live for a few hundred more bucks a month whereas the person who does not own a home has to pay may be NUMBER k per year for rent that wipes out the savings that the author is claiming not only that that money is down the drain since it goes to the landlord whereas the owner of the home builds equity my recommendation is to stay away from this nonsensical book else you will be screwed if you follow his advice,0
boring i bought the book because i read the review and it look interesting and funny but after the first pages i knew that this was a mistake is very repetitive and some of the content really ridiculous for this age and time,0
stuck with you i did not really like the book if the author did not write the sex portion of the book there would not have been much to write about what happened with nick and the law suit it was barely mentioned she could have written more about that and less the descriptive sex,0
none awesome simply awesome i could not put this down and laughed smiled and even got tears a brand new favorite author,1
witty and clever this was a really fun read the dialogue was witty and clever i really enjoyed the progression of the romance it probably could have been tied up a little sooner the last NUMBER th of the book kind of drags out the story with storyline that should have been introduced sooner or ended before it was introduced i do wish more of nick and rachel storyline had been included just because i enjoyed their banter and potential i recommend to any modern romance fan,1
glorify thy name w kent henry great this is a kent henry praise and worship classic you can not go wrong with this one do not sleep on kent henry i have mentioned in previous reviews that he is one of my favorite praise and worship leaders this man is gifted anointed and sings many spontanious praise and worship songs although there are no spontanious songs on this one his cds from his independent labels are loaded with them he has a talent for ushering believers into god presence the songs are a mixture of upbeat and mellow classics this is a must have this cd is out of print and if you can get your hands on one do it quickly,1
lousy outdated guide with horrible printing flaws first thing i noticed about this book was that the pages were stuck together no really they were the printer did not get it right when they cut the edges of this book there were many pages that had to be hand cut just to turn them i could not stand the design then once i get everything readable i find that the information herein is oh about NUMBER years old and totally useless for current midi applications might be ok if you are looking for a history of midi and want to spent an hour making the book readable by cutting the uncut pages so that you can actually read them,0
still yet to recieve i am still yet to receive these items that i purchased NUMBER months ago i have tried everything to track where they might be but no success,0
big things in small package when i purchased this small hardcover book i did not expect very much i was pleasantly surprised when i read it in one sitting twice you will not want to put this one down lbw is simple yet romantic the story originates in africa with childhood friends jacques and margaret margaret moves to london and weds lord berkley when the childhood friends return to africa the storytelling becomes richer even when they are separated by continents decades and lovers jacques and margaret maintain a sweet friendship this is a must read that is well written and culturally enlightening,1
broken the base and frame were not completely attached fixed with a little glue my friend loved it after that,0
lousy rf range on worked from further away than off the range of use was practically useless i could get about NUMBER NUMBER feet of range for the on button but had to put the remote right against the receiver to get the off to even work i bought this particular model because it had discrete on and off buttons to make it easier for my elderly mom to figure out was supposed to be used to remotely reboot her cable modem located in the basement but in the end it was too flaky to let her fuss with it i switched to a different unit which had about NUMBER feet of consistent reliable range and tossed this one in the junk drawer,0
left me feeling wanting somehow if i had spent the time reading the book a little before purchasing i would not have bought it he talks extensively about competition rigs rules etc which i had no interest in i have yet to see a gun rag writer talk honestly about guns ever see a bad review in any of the gun magazines,0

nice but sony must give us more info this is a very nice tripod is strong elegant and cool i love it but the only trouble that i find it it is that this cool gadget does not have a detail list of compatible sony cameras i mean i am an owner of NUMBER sony cybershot camera s the w NUMBER and h NUMBER and i am not able to use the remote control with my cameras only because sony do not give us that information,1
lively experimental synthesizer jazz with global fusion this cd has instrumental experimental jazz and near trance synthesizer pieces some of the rhythm patterns have a latin flavor and feel very danceable others remind me of chill out lounge music a few selections have some subdued vocals that are more part of the background rather than the foreground i enjoyed the selections and liked working with them in the background i have not heard the other volumes in the series and so i can not compare them with each other my only reservations about this collection is that the mood between selections is not always consistent some are more mellow and some are more lively but the mood of the cd is more consistent than a lot of collections i have heard some of the pieces are more experimental than the others and are interesting studies two of them felt slightly dissident to me but the experimental sound still felt worth hearing,1
cut it up def it old school jams i have searched and searched for this cd for the longest i have finally found it now i have to purchase it,1
i do not recommend this vacuum we bought this emer galilieo vacuum cleaner for about NUMBER more than one year ago the retractable cord broke after a short time we had to send the vacuum to nj to get it repaired by using the warranty after a month they sent it back with the same problem and the on off button was broken as well i called the customer service and asked for refund or replacement and they were kind enough to replace the vacuum with a new one this vacuum is very powerful however the handle hose is kind of heavy and the hose twists frequently and makes it difficult to use by considering its high price i guess there should be much better choices than this one if you are looking for a powerful canister vacuum cleaner,0
more fiction than fact donal cline clearly demonstrates his inability to distinguish fact from fiction i find his book to be biased towards the murphy dolan faction poorly researched claiming that billy the kid was known as michael mccarty and his findings to be very questionable presents evidence without veryfiable sources after reading this book i asked myself why did cline write this book he seems to not think to much of billy the kid so why write a book about him why not stick to your true passion and write a documentary about james dolan and l g murphy,0
waste of time and money the squiggler fell apart at second use with no way to put the prongs back into the base this is a worthless piece of junk do not waste your time on this sub standard horribly designed and made product,0

dense with knowledge this film is filled with informative interviews which is great this film is also subtitled not so great definately worth an afternoon watch this film with intention because it is filled with teachings visual cues and subtitles,1

an american treasure charles brown is an american treasure his blues piano stylings are the perfect compliment to his unmistakable vocals the selections on this cd are typical of the high quality music that cb has produced his entire life buy this cd buy any cd by charles brown you will not regret it,1
not finding comfort in food i have read this book in search of a way to view my body and my self more positively however this book claims that only the overweight or people with eating disorders lack self confidence it is not true obviously i am not overweight and never had any eating disorders but i just do not have a positive self image so if you are like me do not read this book i could not relate to it the title is misleading,0
typical thomas video all about james the biggest problem with this dvd is the order of the episodes as someone has complained about in many other video reviews several episodes specifically refer to an episode where a bootstrap is used on james brake line the episode in which this actually occurs is one of the last on the dvd it would have taken like NUMBER more minutes to have the videos play in chronological order other than that it is a good dvd with NUMBER thomas and friends stories in which james is prominent i have a personal complaint too i purchased this in a store not online even though the box said it includes a bonus wooden train my box actually had a take along bertie in it my son did not have a bertie so i was eager to get it but i did not realize it was a metal take along kind not a wooden series my son has no other take along items because we think the wooden series is far better,1
inexpensive but poor quality the set was shipped with a carrying case that was covered in an oil like substance and either the oil or the case itself smelled horrendous also the punches are very dull and not uniformly sharpened or dulled however you look at it i have difficulties cutting through even thin soft silicone sheets sharpening them with a rotary tool helps but i feel i should not have to do that with a brand new product which i am sure is actually repackaged i can not imagine using them for metal let alone most rubbers despite the very affordable price i would not have purchased this set for the above reasons,0
dull and dirty well i do not usually write reviews but i feel the need with this product NUMBER rst they were caked with mud what up with this NUMBER nd they are dulli guess they can be sharpened we will see,0

a disappointing misrepresentation baking with julia is an amazing book it is an exceptionally well written resource that is an accurate reflection of the pbs televised series of same name when i stumbled onto the option to order a dvd suposedly of the full series on the book writter dorie greenspan i ordered it immediately well the dvd arrived today and it is only a minute fraction i e only NUMBER shows from this far more extensive series selection of the books recipes what a misleading dissapointment as i expected when i place the order for this dvd that it reflected the full series nothing in the product description indicated otherewise would i still purchase it if i knew up front that it was not the full series probably yes because i love julia as well as the series and the book however the nature of this post is buyer beware,0
a peek inside the process first thing first homespun is an album of demos for apple venus if you do not have that record look there first although if you are new to xtc skylarking is the usual recommendation so a collection of demos what to expect essentially it a track by track match for apple venus sonically you could not tell it so much a set of demos except in a couple places frivolous tonight because it sounds so complete in fact to the point where some pieces sound virtually identical to their final takes even in places you would not expect it like orchestral workouts river of orchids and green man is it interesting yeah extremely and in a lot of places it can be as good or better than the original knights in shining karma but truth to be told unless you are a diehard you probably do not need to hear the work versions of this material more casual fans definitely want to check out apple venus it a fine record,1
as good as the guy new book on horatio nelson i read antony beevor which got me hooked on stalingrad and this book is as good as beevor it is also as good as hayward new book on admiral nelson both get my high praise scholarly works that are also readable are few and far between so make the most of this guy work,1
a worthy addition to ww ii eastern front histories i have read a tremendous amount on the subject of ww ii history so very rarely do i read a book with anything new to tell me this book is in that class and well written too the two points i found interesting were the discussion of the original focus of hitler NUMBER campaign in russia and the first extensive history i have read about the airlift effort to save paulus NUMBER th army trapped at stalingrad he offers original research into NUMBER the question of just who promised hitler that the luftwaffe could sustain NUMBER th army by airlift and NUMBER just how successful the soviets were in interfering with the airlift for anyone interested in the history of ww ii on the eastern front this book is a must read,1
do not buy this software i tried this software as an alternative to ulead dvd pictureshow the good news dvd photoplay makes it easier to load pictures into a slide show project than ulead software the bad news the software does not work i have tested the program on three computers an ibm laptop with a hp usb cd writer a dell desktop with an internal cd writer and a sony vaio desktop with an internal cd writer whenever i tried to write the project to cd the software failed to recognize my cd writer on each machine i emailed customer support and though i was assured i would receive an answer within NUMBER days NUMBER days later i still have not heard from them i wish i had kept my receipt so that i could get my money back for this worthless software,0

excellent really once i recovered from the eye strain at the tiny print i realized i just read an earth shattering book on wicca and witchcraft taken in hand with all the books with bad history this book fixes them all just rip out the history section in every book you have and glue this book in its place it is unapologetically modernistic with the sources to back it up excellent really excellent,1
its a cable its a cable it works what else do you want i know its not the cheapest one out there but this one says sony on it yea but i am a true believer that you only get what you pay for i am sure its better quality than the five dollar version at the flea market who knows but i sure feel all warm and fuzzy about getting quality sony products,1
awesome book to explain death to children the book is great just watch out for the shipping especially if you want to order more than NUMBER you can not do it without paying double the shipping bad rip off,1
i am grateful for this book we had two beloved cats die during my child fifth year and i wanted a book that dealt with death frankly but gently this book does not promise eternal life or give any religious message in several different ways and using different living things as examples the book communicates that death is a natural part of life my girl has even requested this book a couple times at bedtime which i found slightly surprising,1
effective book for discussing physical death with a child as a public school librarian i would say that lifetimes is an effective picture book for an adult to share with a child or children in dealing with the subject of death however as a person of faith i would add that the scope of this book is limited to earthly life and therefore does not touch on the belief in life after death the text states nothing that is alive goes on living for ever this statement either reflects the authors intent on only dealing with the concept of physical death or it could be interpreted as their belief statement this is why i suggest that lifetimes be read by or shared with a caring adult who would be able to answer a child questions based on a family belief system,1
great band even better now ra has to be one of the most underrated band in rock music when i heard their first cd i was blown away these guys are amazing the whole feel of this band is just is so different than anything i have heard in many years this cd is really good and i would hope the world would sit up and take notice these guys are talented musicians and in modern music that can be rare the music is angery and powerful and then it is smooth and melodic tell me i lost everything today the only one and got me going are some of the ones that stand out to me the cover of the police every little thing she does is magic is one of the more interesting covers i have ever heard if you liked from one the buy this disc i would love to see these guy live,1
usa NUMBER is this the current state of scholarship at the academy today no footnotes or primary sources listed for such conclusions are we supposed to believe these pinheads just because they have phd behind their name the other side can list hundreds of primary sources in their works i am sure all the pc teachers and profs love this and it will probably be a staple at every modern college not worth a dime for a thinking person who really wants the truth,0
worst night world book this is the worst book in the night world series gillian is lj smith worst heroine mary lynette is the best gillian is superficial all she thinks about is being the most popular girl at school and getting david david is the worst night world hero thierry is the best he is stupid he cheated on the sats if you have not read any of the night world books do not start with this one,1
this book is messed up in this book not only is there no real love scenes but to top it off the girl cousin tries to convince her that he is her soulmate granted angel is dead but he still related to her and definately should not be trying to catch his own cousin ewww to top off the wrongness that is this book there is barely any mention of vamps and stuff also this is a of age story about how being popluar is not the most important i love every other night world book but this is retarded,0
impressive one of the few cds of asatru music that i actually enjoy i could quibble with some things in the lyrics which are not quite in line with the lore but overall i find the music both pleasant and inspiring this cd draws upon scandinavian folk music for inspiration for its melodies with the exception of one track the lyrics are in english the lead singer andrea nebel haugan can actually sing professionally done and melodic many of my non heathen friends also enjoy listening to this cd,1
the haiku year exemplifies integrating creativity this small gem of a book can be appreciated not only from a modern poetic viewpoint but also from a philosophical standpoint as a comment on integrating pure creativity into our everyday motions read this book and be prepared to question your own thoughts perceptions might change after an afternoon with this book,1
not what i hoped for i had expected or at least hoped for a more or less straightforward account of the mothman phenomenon of some NUMBER years ago instead this meandering book comprises hick ufo sightings that are only infrequently connected with mothman and keel trust me i know what i am talking about theories and explanations i was particularly dismayed by seemingly endless accounts of men in black behaving badly with little to recommend it and aside from providing some details on the mothman sightings there no other recommendation the mothman prophecies is a considerable disappointment,0
shame on you mr keel let me just start by saying that the mothman prophecies is not a novel nor is it a coherent story it starts strong just enough to draw you in then it goes down the spectral energy crap hole were led to believe that mr keel is a sensiable unbiased investigator when really he a parinoid delusional whack i am only NUMBER and i do not buy a word of it see the movie instead,0
and the point was although i prefer books with an actual plot i do not mind reading choppy journal type entries if there is actually a point to all of it or if at least such entries are entertaining this book are albeit only in the beginning after a while you will begin to wonder if the author wanted to portray himself as a paranoid schizophrenic or if that just a side effect of the complete lack of organization and logic in his writing style this book was not worth the time or the title there hardly anything about the mothman in it,0
mothman proficies NUMBER pages covering men in black lights in the sky and phone troubles NUMBER pages about the mothman if you want to read the same old NUMBER ufo stories this is your book if you want to read about the mothman buy something else,0
never before have i quit reading a book i made it to page NUMBER before i had to stop i have waited years to read this oh man was i disappointed i thought it would be an intelligent well written peice on the mothman mystery i do not know what this was holy mackeral i have never seen such bad writing someone else mentioned incoherent tell me about it this was all over the place i had absolutely no clue was was going on in this book just crazy just a few of my favourites so horrified she dropped the small baby in her arms the child began to cry more insulted than hurt what i am thinking the kids was more hurt than insulted this keel dude is too much talking about this mysterious guy tiny who a witness said saw a wire running up his pant leg and i quote was tiny wearing electric socks or was he a wired android operated by remote control what pretty much where i stopped before my mind turned to mush,0
are you joking i am giving it one star because less is not possible here you people do realize that this book and all others of its kind are complete and utter fiction right there is and can be no truth behind them whatsoever no science no documentary or physical evidence nothing there are no mibs except in the movies no secret conspiracies to hide evidence of alien visitations no alien abductions absolutely none of this book or any of its kind are true ask yourselves if this is really true then why with our government so unable to keep secrets about presidential peccadillos financial scandals politcal dirty tricks payoffs espionage and intelligence screwups and the like how any conspiracy of this magnitude escaped detection and revelation it simply makes no sense it is pure entertainment nothing more and you five star reviewers have credit cards,0
fine if you support terrorism i find the terrorist links in her songs offensive taken from fire fire growin up brewin upguerilla gettin trained uplook out look outfrom over the rooftop reffering to ltte snipers competition coming up nowload up aim fire fire pop she has a lot of ltte propaganda in her music website and even promotes this terrorist organisation in her music she needs to get a grip and the people buying her music need to get a grip and actually look at what they are buying here,0
good for afterwork cruising better for airplane tranquility listening to this cd i turned my car stereo all the way up on my way back from work the lyric is very ostentatious and the beats are showy NUMBER dollars and hombre are two of my favorite tracks they are both clever yet funny it does have a political overtone but it ok i like the revolution type mood it actually very good stuff when you are on a plane totally blocks out the crying sound of babies next seat and you can imagine a party in your head,1
what the big deal the only thing interesting about this album is mia accent seriously the beats her singing is layered over are tired and clich d if the vocals on this album were by anyone else it would not be in the top NUMBER final verdict bad music,0
excellant i love kala as well because it sounds cleaner and more developed however this album was an excellant break out in her career fire fire is one of my favorites mix with marijuana,1
so original so fun a friend introduced me to this cd and it quickly become a favourite m i a music so catchy and so fun to dance to yet it also lasting i have been listening to it over and over and i love the fact that she brings an ethnic vibe into her music,1
noritake colorwave stoneware i was disappointed with the shipping delay of the cooking company they said they would reimburse the shipping charges but to this date they have not the product was shipped beyond the date which they said they would ship it and this was an unusual amount of time,0
a wish to time travel to NUMBER rockaway old rockaway new york in early photographs exceeded my expectations i thought it would provide a photographic history of perhaps the NUMBER and NUMBER i was pleasantly surprised to find nineteenth century photographs of the peninsula in its true heyday having lived in arverne during the NUMBER and NUMBER i was amazed to see that the rich and famous visited this area very similar to the way the rich and famous today visit the hamptons on the east end of long island as you view the postcards from this early era you can actually see the unspoiled landscape of sand dunes and bay marshes that no longer exist and the magnificent hotels and homes that graced this once popular resort prove to me that the city of new york truly mis managed the development since the NUMBER,1
old age gold as a NUMBER year old man from the uk i was stunned by how this record took me back to bike rides along the beach in a simpler time which was quite frankly before my time i love it and hope you do too thanks oc,1
tiene que ser sensilla quien no va a ser sensilla con la poca fama talento y bellesa que esta mujer tiene no tiene voz suave ni fuerte deveria dedicarse a otra cosa lo que sea menos cantar y actuar porque seria igual de ridicula que patty navidad este es uno de los peores discos que he escuchado en toda mi vida,0
repetitive and monotone i really wanted to like this book based on the title and the cover art instead i found myself not caring about the narrator whatsoever she repeats the same few thoughts throughout the entire book she reminds the reader that her mother is dead and that nobody loves her so many times that i stopped caring about her situation her repetition and monotone voice stops the narrator from being truly developed as a character that we can connect with some parts of her story seem unnecessary and pointless as they do not really lead to anything of interest later on her characterization was too direct and left nothing for the reader to consider for themselves the title is extremely misleading as we learn absolutely nothing about her mother aside from her death during childbirth i am unable to find anything positive to describe about this book sadly,0
worst book i have ever read this has got to be one of the most depressing books i have ever read not depressing in the sense that the tone of the book was depressing which it was but depressing in the sense that it was such poor quality this was the first book i attempted to read by the author since i could not waste my time trying to finish it i am pretty sure i will not be reading any other books by jamaica kincade,0
frankenstein continued when i first heard about this book i wonderded if it was going to be a new story or a continuation fortunately a continuation i had read reviews about the book here and after the local library did not ever have a copy in sock i bought it i read it in NUMBER days reading each night after work i can say it was a good read steady flowing action no real dull moments no unnecessary story lines etc i was not disappointed at all i gave it only NUMBER stars much for the same reason others have the ending was rushed and abrupt but never fear there is to be NUMBER more books before the real ending so we all have something to look forward to this is only the second koontz book i have read so i was unable to distinguish where he was writing and the other author was writing more die hard koontz fans may be able to tell the difference so overall a good smooth never dull read highly recommend it to anyone looking for a different take on the classic tale of a mad scientist,1
fine until it started eating tapes like many of the other reviewers my zr NUMBER is now giving me the infamous remove cassette message and is mangling tapes i have used it to record maybe NUMBER hours worth of video over the last two years search the web for canon zr users group and eating tapes to hear similar horror stories stay away from canon camcorders,0
my goodness world do noti repeatdo not get this camcorderthere is nothing worse than thisi wasted money buying it from amazon comi could have gotten the same thing for less including firewire NUMBER dv and a carrying caseit is honestly the worst disgusting and despicable electronic out thereif you get this you will have literallyliterally threw your money into the atlantic oceando not get this even if someone pays for it return it get your money back,0
lots of effects lightweight easy to use awesome camcorder camera functions in this lightweight easy to use camcorder make it a breeze to shoot great memories for a novice like me right out of the box this camcorder also has a huge selection of special effects and options to make really interesting video effects i love this camcorder,1
excellent book for the novice improviser to the instructor izzy does a great job of making the format of the book simple yet engaging his explaination of the games with goals group size time process and variations for each of the games is very helpful it is written so that a sales team leader could pick it up and have some great games to get his her team thinking creatively working on teamwork and self confidence my only complaint as a past performer and current instructor is that it is not long enough write another,1
hard to find tension rods our living room has a bow window with five narrow panels i looked many places for narrow but strong tension rods i was pleased to find these and to get free shipping i am very happy with my purchase thank you,1
yes yes yes great read love the book i was born NUMBER years too late i would have liked to been there at the time however massacre does not sound like it feels good lol,1
a must have i am not one for writing reviews just in it for the music dance with angels is fantastic you pass on this cd and it is your loss,1
paradise kiss rocks omg thats all i can say its just sooo fabulous when i first heard about it i was contridicting weather or not i should read it but then i decided hey why not now that i read this fab manga theres no turning back this is totally a keeper i strongly recomend,1
if you are a nirvana fan this album is not for you i am a huge nirvana fan i have been one ever since NUMBER when i first listened to bleach if you are die hard like me you will not like this album you probably already have all the songs on this album so do not waste your money the only reason i would recommend someone to but this album is if they did not buy the box set i wish i had my NUMBER NUMBER back,0
ehh the disc is intact but the case is in terrible ocndition it is broken in half and chipped off of the top portion of the case,0
true nirvana sucks i will tell you what really in the spirit of the band that fbi seal and warning on the back cover that states that any and all duplications of the cd are illegal not that anybody would enjoy a duplication anyway if this is true nirvana then true nirvana sucks,0
garbage complete garbage the sound quality is horrible if your going to release a best of cd record it with something other than a preschool microphone covered with a wet rag,0
not what i expected i should have read what the cd was about i thought it was just music by chopin but it was really a lot of soprano singing,0
love these glasses i love these anchor hocking glasses my parents have had a set of this pattern for years when i moved into my own place in college and was tired of the free plastic cups i had i went to the store and found these glasses i have NUMBER big glasses in a blue color but i am wanting matching in a smaller glass and can not seem to find the same color anyway i really like that the squares help you hold the glass easier also these glasses are very stable do not tip easily plus they are bottom heavy but not too bottom heavy that way they do not slip out of your hands as easily i have broken many other glasses cause they were too bottom heavy but i have never broken one of these,1
forsyte saga a well awarded but oft forgotten classic i will make this short and to the point i am quite the avid reader but usually i do not enjoy books of this nature opting for fantasy and sci fi escapism instead this story is just beautifully told though the subtleties of the characters and the twisting lives of the forsyte family are fascinating and makes this one helluva a page turner i was hooked immediately i honestly believe that people of all ages will love this book and i urge you to give it a shot i know sometimes that novels taking place in this particular era can seem daunting for those of us who crave more adventure action type books but there is no lack of excitement here,1
the book is great but the edition is an embarrasment for oxford university press there are quite a few annoying typos i can see how the new forsyte by the name scames or the unlisted french word ficbe came about as a result of faulty character recognition but how soames born in NUMBER got to be thirty eight in in NUMBER is beyond me do not they have proof readers anymore by all means read the book you may find out how a lot of later works of literature derive from it but not in this edition,0
expensive experiment that did not work i was hoping for an acid that was convenient to use well this is pretty convenient just swipe but it did nothing for me i wanted to try and get rid of the little bumps clogging my pores and frequent breakouts however my skin remained the same and while it does not really have a scent there seems to be some chemicals wafting off the pads that affected my sinuses because i have quite a sensitive nose i switched to using them on my back and got the same result which was nothing so it was an expensive experiment that did not work it may work for someone else but it did nothing for me most disappointing i have since switched to the salicylic gel peel which hurts a whole lot more but gets the job done,0
lame jujitsuka i find that the moves that wally jay was at best very mediocre i am originally from hawaii and have had many judokas that can do major moves that when watching them the moves that they do is much more fluid and very continuous to see that many martial artists are screaming their credentials and rank is making me tired though i started martial arts at NUMBER years old and became a head instructor at NUMBER i have more skills that i need to perfect i just hope to see real martial artists can be recognised,0
small type my review centers on only one thing the type size this edition is disappointingly and in my humble opinion unnecessarily small increasing the type size a point or two would move the edition from unreadable to readable and at most increase the book length by about a hundred pages since it is currently at almost NUMBER pages i feel quite certain the binding could accommodate another NUMBER pages with no problem what makes it all the more frustrating is that the type itself is a nice clean face that would not require a magnifying glass if it was just a little larger i really do not believe our lord meant for us to suffer eye strain to read his word nor do i think he wants us to carry around large books when small books with readable type would serve the his purpose,0
takes tree hugging to a new level third in the forest of midworld one had better learn to hug close to one home tree or risk being killed by innumerable plants animals insects and other beings less well categorized yet despite a living space defined by various levels of hell below and above this planet accommodates a small group of humans who succeeded in adapting to its rigors ironically the one intolerable element is the relatively new colony set up in a clear cut space by humans with corporate minds and driven by more motives than just sheer greed alan dean foster is one of my favorite authors though i remain envious of his imagination writing skills and the interesting life he has fashioned for himself as much as possible on this planet he experienced much of the action he describes in his fiction,1
best alan dean foster book i read this years ago when i was a pre teen and it had me hooked on sf alan dean has let me down time and time again since but this book is a classic you must read this one it will be fun and you will not be able to put it down after finishing this one try hunting down dark star a movie novelization that is almost as good as midworld,1
plain putrid this book is so obscene in some parts and its not even written by naomi campbell but some filthy man do not pick up this book if you want your brain to be burnt away by the promiscious literary flop of some freak,0
can i shoot myself now a few years back i was forced to read tess for my english class nobody in my class could ever finish reading the book only a few of us could ever even finish the cliff notes for it our professor tried solving the situation by renting us the video but all of us were fast asleep half an hour into it tess is a bimbo with no brain and an insult to women yes even at that time this book is over rated and should not be called a classic if you really want to read good literature read d h lawrence read tolstoy read evn modern classical writers like achebe but for crying out loud do not waste your time and money on tess,0
awful this was one of the worst books i have ever read it goes on way to long with a lot of filler which seems out of place,0
cruel and depressing story hardy paints a cruel picture of women in lower society they are either tempted or cause evil mischief with a tragic ending he had created a virtuous women in the form of tess and ends her as a criminal it is impossible for a women of tess virtue to turn into a criminal i would not recommend this book to anyone who would look to escape from depression,0
the book was boring because of its victorian ideals tess was a very boring book from an analytical point the book major theme was fate however you must be interested in the victorian era in order to enjoy the book it is the same thing with the scarlet letter to enjoy the book you must know about the time era the problems that the characters are faced with in the book are laughable by todays standards,0
obligatory my kindle is making me do this one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen,1
good companion piece i read this book soon after i had seen the a e mini series reading the book after watching the series gave me a better appreciation for the dialect s hardy uses throughout the novel which could be a little difficult to decipher very good book overall,1
great classic i remember having to read this novel in high school and wanted to read it again i had forgotten most of the story and thoroughly enjoyed following tess through her trials and tribulations albeit some self imposed,1
beautifully written dark masterpiece about an unforgetable victorian girl a beautifully written dark masterpiece about an unforgetable victorian girl her father discovers he is descended from aristocracy and drinks himself into a stupor unable to fulfill his obligations tess takes his place and through a series of misfortunes is sent away to rich with the hope of getting financial assistance for her family she meets a rogue at the mansion and is taken in by him in so many ways fast forward she meets another man and falls in love through their tragic love story much is discovered about the morality rules and expectations of victorian society thomas hardy has brought to life amazing characters in this work and he has conceived a story which will embed themselves into the psyche as one contemplates this work again and again it a beautiful love story and so much more highly recommended,1
i hated this book then and hate it now my only revenge for being forced to read tess as a kid is to write a negative review as an adult so there that done,0
bad purchace well i thought i was getting the student edition but i got the instructor edition i guess i will have to go back to b n,0
ummm i have been using this for several months now and i am not particularly impressed by it the liquid itself is smooth and silky and it goes on and washes off quite easily but it seems to not have done anything to for my skin jury sill out for me,0
science fact empowers science fiction mars rising is the best documentary i have ever seen about the issues surrounding a future manned mission to mars shatner voice over gives it extra credibility race to mars is the most realistic movie ever made in the manned mission to mars genre,1
unbearable lightness of being unbearable yet enjoyable in an age of communist oppression we see a side of daniel day lewis reminiscent of the lovable letch in the age of innocence daniel plays perfectly a doctor living in prague who can not tolerate oppression or resist women and both influences drive him to do the unimaginable it amazing seeing two main rivals for his affections manage not to kill each other as they pussyfoot around the painful truth lena olin sabina is the perfect seductress in her famous bowler hat and one can easily love as well as hate her as she tries to deceive the ever wise tereza tomas wife juliette binoche thumbs up to tereza who acknowledges what tomas can not as she forces him to face his weakness and their love provides a measure of redemption still it tomas decision to return to prague that results in terrible consequences if not for the needless eroticism this would have been a NUMBER star movie,1
please read kundera book instead kundera novel the unbearable lightness of being is absolutely amazing and this film falls so far short of it despite my almost immediate dislike of the film i actually stuck it out and watched the entire thing hoping that daniel day lewis could somehow salvage it or that the film might actually express some idea from kundera book but i was sorely disappointed but please read kundera novel because it is wonderful i can not help but think that kundera was referring to this film when he wrote in his later novel immortality the present era grabs everything that was ever written in order to transform it into films tv programs or cartoons what is essential in a novel is precisely what can only be expressed in a novel and so every adaptation contains nothing but the nonessential,0
sad yet beautiful the unbearable lightness of being is the ability to give your body without becomimg emotionally involved this is no problem for the hero of this film but it is a wrenching experience for the heroine who believes in emotional and physical fidelity to her mate and can not change her feelings this film explores the difference between the two and the pain that one causes the other by his lightness of being towards the end the movie becomes a tearjerker so be ready to cry your eyes out,1
milan kundera rides again a wonderful drama of the unfolding of two lives read the book too not for the shallow minded,1
lacking the movie was fine to watch but it was so different from the book i told my father all about the book so he decided to rent the movie from the library and watch it with me big mistake in the film the sex scenes came off as standard sex scenes in the book there is a strong focus on the involved parties thoughts and motivations void of philosophy and psychology,0
the unbearable length of worker parasite end spoiler basically it goes like this eastern european intellects survive by being in constant angst and having lots of sex at the end of what seems frigging hours and hours of self loathing when they finally find happiness they all die in a truck accident,0
disappointed i have been very impressed by other pickin on music lynyrd skynyrd led zep santana to name a few i have however hendrix music did not translate well at all into the bluegrass style it was a great disappointment and this is one cd i will get rid of quickly,0
the birth of drone as far as i know this predates anything else known as drone music which seems to be a popular genre these days this is about as psychedelic as it gets your mind wandering out into the infinite void so good,1
short stories with a message living in chaos is living in stability is a book involving true stories with powerful thoughts which are encouraging and uplifting this book is personal in that it is about peoples private lives and their experiences and yet it relates to everyday life because these experiences can occur to anybody whether you are at the peak of your life or beginning a new chapter in your life something drastic can happen and change your world around the stories are touching yet enlightening and they bring you inner strength to deal with the realities of life i would strongly recommend this book to readers from all walks of life,1
fantastic products great way to try them all i try everything new hoping to find something that will show me some results right away and give me back the glow in my skin that seems to wither away as time passes and i am only NUMBER anyway when i read about rice bran i thought why not this brand contains a lot of rice bran it like the NUMBER nd ingredient in everything after water and there is nothing else in it i could not pronounce the stuff smells great and goes on non greasy especially the face cream it like my face is so thirsty for it that it just sucks it all in the truerenu store gives you cute little pahmplets with details on all the ingredients and insturctions the packages are written in japanese so you need to read their instructions and i even got a free gift of green tea yum,1
amazingly soft hair i have been looking for an all natural shampoo and this is a wonderful one it made my hair incredibly soft with tons of body i was incredibly surprised at how well it worked on my hair the sample is worth the price just to test it out,1
prose poetry to inspire i agree with most of the positive reviews on this book and although i am a little biased kerouac is my favorite author this book inspired me to write a poem after i finished reading it and although it may not inspire you to do anything at all it is that good that it could inspire something positive in your life or even in your viewpoint or artwork if you are an artist i read on the road the town and the city and just before this one the subterraneans which i found really great but quite difficult to read without having blood run out of your ear from sentences that were NUMBER or NUMBER pages long this one was much more fun to read and i could not put it down if you really like jack you should also check out james baldwin and norman mailer,1
on the road to enlightenment less plot more pot than on the road where kerouac most famous novel was all about reckless travel music girls and rebellion dharma bums is more introspective lots of meditation soul searching and existential ruminations about life truth and nature my only regret is that i did not choose the book format as it was hard to keep up with all the philosophical ramblings while listening in the car,1
flat kerouac i am amazed at how many people find the dharma bums worth reading it kerouac at his flattest the sentences lack his usual energy and lyrical beauty there is virtually no action and the buddhist philosophy feels pasted on and contrived this is definitely not a kerouac book to recommend readers would to better to pick up a copy of desolation angels or excepting the NUMBER pages of transcribed conversation in the middle visions of cody if you have already read lots of kerouac and you want to move on to a modern counterpart pick up vincent czyz adrift in a vanishing city lyrical experimental hot house writing that takes a quick talkin drifter out of his native kansas as far afield as berlin mexico city and paris and through it all he never loses his vernacular even when waxin metaphysical you might also try sliding over to henry miller not tropic of cancer which is his most popular but sexus which is far better written,0
self indulgent nonsense the operative word from the title is bums this is a book about them and their self indulgent self righteous idleness a work with no redeeming features,0
outlines of theology aa hodge kindle edition very disappointed the book is a great work but there are so many unreadable words in the kindle e book edition that after a few pages of frustration you finally give up trying this product should either be taken off the availablity or corrected for errors so it becomes readable,0
life changing this book has changed my life it opened my eyes about how we think ourselves into misery i am want to buy copies to away give to people in my life,1
not worth it mediocre at best story line was bad dry and predictable only action scenes drew interest they used one liners from previous movies,0
wait for the better dvd combo so dissapointing i pre ordered this thinking it was a great deal for NUMBER but i was so wrong not only was it just the blu ray movie but there were no extras on either the blu ray or the regular dvd they rushed this out to trick us all this is worth NUMBER not NUMBER for NUMBER i bought the extended edition blu ray dvd combo edition of suckerpunch and it came with over NUMBER hours of extras wait for the better verison this movie is so incredible save your money and wait to see it with the extras trust me i returned this the day i got it and will be saving up for the deluxe edition and maybe even the box set with tons of extras,0
not really a good movie this film is like a teenager with short attention span storytelling is like facebooking too many plots to cover horrible pacing no depth,0
transformers the NUMBER d was awesome in this movie makes the movie even more better this movie was more darker then the other movies ther some comedy thrown in at the right moment,1
loved it i am an original transformers fan from the original cartoon there was action from start to finish and the love story did not slow thing for me i have watched this movie numerous times and still see things i missed the first few times i watch it loved it,1
transformers dark of the moon all i can say is awesome the family loved it and was so very happy to watch and enjoy on a great family evening thanks bunches,1
tranformers dark of the moon transformers dark of the moon my granddaughter really enjoys watching this dvd she especially likes bumble bee she is fascinated by their transformation,1
NUMBER was a sin NUMBER was an atrocity NUMBER lacks a word to describe its awfulness when i saw a review giving this movie NUMBER out of NUMBER the NUMBER rd time this respected source has ever done so i should have listened if NUMBER had plot holes NUMBER has plot chasms there is no story a few special effects can not redeem such gaping wounds that make up the rest of the film plot charisma fan service michael bay really needs to stop raping people childhoods a la south park george lucas style go watch the NUMBER animated film instead and save yourself the excruciating pain that is the dark side of the moon and i am not talking pink floyd,0
yeah i mean this was never the greatest movie ever but i own the other two so logically i had to have this one came quickly shipped well no problems except the film itself just bad,1
please if this is the way this franchise is going stop this rated as one of the worst movies that i have ever see i found it to be a total waste of my time unless you are a devoted transformers fan that must see or have all things transformers stay away from this movie,0
instant video is mislabeling it movies as NUMBER d i did a search for NUMBER d movies on amazon instant video and this movie came up but when i purchased it i was disapointed to see that it was not NUMBER d i am writing this review without watching more than NUMBER minutes of the movie so it not that the movie is bad amazon needs to re label their NUMBER d movie selection,0
another game type of movie whyyy lots of loud noise and quick movements just the kinds of things that monkeys and idiots enjoy please for the love of god do not make another sequel this movie really sucked,0
great eye candy but compares poorly to the first one no surprises left and a highly predictable plot but great action scenes and spectacular special effects tires hard to reinvigorate the first episode but lacks the suspense and drama my NUMBER years olds got a kick out of it i got bored,0
horrible absolutely rubbish would not feed this film to a dog simply not good by any measure you really ought to find something else to do with your time sure wish i did,0
transformers dark of the moon by most accounts the michael bay directed transformers films to date are not very good but that has not stopped them from making gobs and gobs of cash and this third installment dark of the moon made the most of them all this time around sam witwicky and the autobots must race to recover and protect an ancient autobot ancestor who crash landed on the moon but the decepticons interfere and things are not exactly as they seem i found dark of the moon to be an improvement over the second installment with some impressive special effects work and action sequences but the film as a whole leaves a lot to be desired do not expect to find much more to the movie than ooh big robots and explosions but hey for some that really all you need,0
the movie itself is ok the streaming for it was crap the movie would not play steadily i had to watch this on netflix later an error kept popping up saying my internet connection was not fast enough to play the movie my internet connection was fine i had watched movies before and after and when i checked online with amazon customer service page i more than all the minimum requirements this is the first time i have had problems streaming with amazon but it was awful every NUMBER the movie would stop and pop up the error message i tried restarting the app restarting my ps NUMBER and no luck,0
the perfect movie for a NUMBER yr old i gave it one star because the website does not allow it to go any lower and for all the effort put in by the computer animation team other than that this movie should be negative NUMBER star the plot and sequences does not make any sense what so ever to list a few teleporting another planet into earth atmosphere really optimus prime getting trapped in a bunch of cables for NUMBER mins of the movie high tech alien robotic race ends up fighting with shields swords and axes there literally some plot hole or something that does not make sense every NUMBER minutes of the movie throughout the entire thing if you thought the second movie was ridiculous wait until you see this the only reason to watch this movie is if you want to leave your brain dead for NUMBER hours and watching flashy robots transform and fire rockets at random things besides that please do yourself a favor and do something more productive with the extra NUMBER hours of your life,0
lights out on this awful film i went to see this with the hope of getting revenge of the fallen bad taste out of my mouth fission mailedwhere to begin the plot while being nowhere near as immature as rotf still suffered from being clogged with too much filler and not making much sense it an overlong mess with the cgi eye candy being the only redeeming factor of this film it clear that bay knows how to make a big budget action film with explosions aplenty but he can not write a decent script for these movies to save his life it not his fort and has not been since the rock the movie peaks with a huge final battle in chicago that is nuts but you will just be wanting it to be over with by the time it finally takes place the NUMBER d is well used in spots but that can not make up for the fact that almost everything in it is just a letdown do not buy unless you really want to complete your collection,0
not that great the first transformers movie will always be the best one and its just ok the movies too long jumping back and forth very poorly constructed,0
digital copy code expired NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER i bought this during a black friday sale the digital copy was significant part of my purchasing decision inexcusably the digital copy code expired before this product was sold at a minimum this should have been disclosed in the product description,0
love this movie great movie but no special features on it once i opened that movie i noticed that there is a NUMBER off coupon for the NUMBER d version that is coming out with special features,1
could have been much better and shorter the plot storyline was not cohesive the movie is way too long with the characters not really coming to life making a movie longer is not making a movie better in fact if the movie is weak making it longer just makes the point even more painfully obvious i kept watching the movie to see if it would improve but unfortunately that was not the case maybe dreamworks will just move on to another project save your money if you intend to buy better rent and save the rest for a better movie,0
review of transformers dark of the moon this is an enjoyable science fiction actioner with a fairly plausible plot for this type movie it also has excellent acting both the live actors and the voice acting for the transformer robots only beef is that it language makes it inappropriate for tweens and pre teens overall excellent for adults and recommended,1
transformers dark of the moon a pure joy to watch with its many special effects it is a true master piece that will keep you on the edge of your seat,1
movie is ok but the title of the disk pack is totally wrong it should be blue ray dvd and digital copy available for dla NUMBER gb download to get the digital copy instead of including it to me is lame you enter a very long url then input the code and start the download managerafter it is finished you have to enter the long url again when you try to play the movie and get a error NUMBER website not foundi can get to any other web site i enter but not to the transformers site so now the digital copy will not play because the site can not be accessed paramount should take lessons from fox on how to include the digital copy,0
guys movie so for all of you people saying this movie was bad take a step back and look at what you are watching this is a hollywood movie made for an audience who loves explosions cars guns sexy women and a simple story line this movie was not made to be realistic it is a sci fi movie just pop some corn watch it and enjoy way better than the notebook or any other chick flick out there,1
never thought i miss megan fox i was very excited to see this movie available on amazon prime but i was disappointed once i started watching i really could not stand sam new model girlfriend she was so annoying and spends most of the film posing and pouting prettily i was also confused during a lot of the movie and had trouble figuring out who a lot of the decepticons were because they seemed very similar of course i must admit that maybe it would have been clearer if i had followed more of the transformers cartoon another big flaw was in the long action sequence involving a glass building there foreshadowing when the nasa guy announces that they are going to be taking refuge in a glass building what could possibly go wrong,0
transformers dark of the moon watched this one and the previous one several times like this movie lots and so did the kids thanks so much,1
thought transformers suppose to be for kids i know a lot of movies are not going to be kid friendly that you will have to fast forward past some things but transformers that advertise a kids theme sold as toys at stores can be find in macdonald happy meals so you would think the movie be for kids but it not they focus more on sam and love gal then what the robots story forget sam the name of the movie is transformers i rate this movie NUMBER star love the cgi for the robots but you barley seen the robots the whole movies is about sam and his love interest michael bay need to hang this up and give it to a true comic fan who can direct a movie about transformers pitiful,0
safety pins as another reviewer noted these do not pierce cloth well at all so were basically useless for me i threw them in the trash,0
bad movie by a bad wrestler do not bother cena does not have the potential of the rock or even kane for that matter they are just trying to make more money off of the uneducated wrestling fan,0
b movie licious i am surprised by how much i enjoyed this surprised and a little disappointed in my own taste but anyway you know exactly what to expect from this movie explosions fighting and that it luckily it delivers both of those in spades especially the i have never seen so many things blow up every fifteen minutes john cena barely escapes some building blowing up and in slow motion of course the story is kelly carlson is kidnapped by robert patrick and john cena must rescue her robert patrick is plain fantastic in this flick the filmmaker is smart as he gave the lion share of the line to mr patrick he plays a great sarcastic bad guy plain and simple john cena can act in the sense that arnold schwarzenegger can act mr cena lets his actions do the speaking thankfully plus he a hottie so overall just an easy cheesy blow em up action b movie the extras are pretty lame though,1
hell no might actually watch this if cena was not in it if his acting is any worse than his wrestling persona this will be his last movie update marine ii will star ted dibease hahahahahahah lol pathetic,0
what a complete and utter waste of time and money this movie really is a complete stinkpot the acting is horrible the action is way too over the top and unbeleivable and the comedy is way too stupid and cheesy first off the movie gets started in a crazy action scene war flashback no story what so ever the car chase scene is so full of it a car gets shot with a high powered rifle like NUMBER times and is still driving around even the twist at the end was completely easy to figure out please avoid this reeking exploding crock of,0
please listen to me do not buy this product i have had many problems with sony computer items before but i thought i give this one a try after being on the phone with sony who did not even know what the emarker was for over four hours i still can not the thing to work there some problem with the program you download from emarker com the program has problems loading the emarker usb drive into your computer thus you can not use it at all if i were you i wait till they develop this product further and work out all the problems sony told me they would pass my problem on to the research and development team who would try to get back to me as soon as they can i hope this team knows what the product is as for me i plan on returning my emarker today,0
sony e marker is now obsolete excellent product but sony is taking down the support for the product at the end of sept so do not bother buying shame as it was really good while it lasted,1
good idea good looks needs lots of work i recently purchased the emarker by sony it shows how far technology has come it also shows how useless some of afformentioned technology can be it looks great attached to my keyring needless to say with it sleek stylish good looks it attracts lots of attention the main problem is its lack of extremely useful features i hope sony makes some revisions and releases a better more useful product like we have come to expect from them,1
totally useless i too bought into the hype that the emarker presented but after using it for a week i realized how pathetic this product is its nothing more than a clock that marks the time of day you here the song and nothing else you have to look up everything manually including the radio station and the appropriate time not only that but you have to memorize which mark stands for which station it does not even do that how stupid does sony believe they can just sell products by putting their name on it tsk tsk the product is also really dependent on the internet so if you do not have a good connection like me you can forget the practicality of the emarker actually even if you do have a cable or dsl line its still useless,0
worthless where is the space for a zero star just purchased a emarker and ill tell you one thing i should have read these reviews first all the bad you hear about this little thing is true i am not priveliged enough to live in an area sony feels compelled to offer service in so i do not even have one station to mark the site is terrible and i can not even get the program to enable itself whats the difference though can not do anything with it anyway this is typical sony my advice check out all the ratings here and go to the website and see if they even offer any stations in your area believe me they will not tell you it will not work in your area it however is a neat idea needs lots of work,0
another thingabob on a key chain e marker started to lose it appeal when i had a problem with the driver sony provided little assistance with the situation and i basically had to solve it through trial and error the website was easy to manuever through but receiving the proper listings was not constant i will give sony credit for coming up with the idea and respect it potential however for now it serves as a interesting eye candy piece for my key chain,0
sony has pulled the plug use of the emarker depends on the emarker website however sony has just announced that they are discontinuing the website and so emarker devices will now be useless do not buy one unless you want a museum piece for those of us that already own an emarker sony has graciously offered to provide a cash refund for every emarker returned directly to them,0
worthless sony has stopped supporting the e marker and is offering refunds to anyone who already has one,0
do not buy this junk before buying this product i read all the reviews unfortunately i did not pay enough attention to the warnings that the product does not work i thought i could trust a company like sony to deliver a reliable product and figured that the poor reviews were the result of consumer error i was wrong the complementary reviews on this site just can not be real the product looks nice but works like a piece of junk,0
artwork did the national socialists require censorship here or something the new artwork is not even scary wtf you have ruined a classic no one buy this bs,0
absolutely ruined it as a child i would stare at the gammell illustrations while re reading each story over and over the illustrations made this book much more imaginative and influential in my opinion the new illustrations do not do this beloved set justice i am extremely disappointed to find out that the original is out of print do not buy this for yourself or your kid i loved these books so much when i was a kid that i am actually going to write a letter on paper with a stamp to harper collins telling them about the role that crazy art had on my imagination and development as a creative person jeez absolutely terrible the new illustrator must have no dignity to ruin this,0
i can read book has better illustrations while the stories in the scary stories to tell in the dark book remain the same the stephen gammell illustrations that haunted my imagination have been scrapped for more candy coated pictures how candy coated upon searching for the other tales of horror by alvin schwartz in a dark dark room which was written for level NUMBER of the i can read children collection i found those water colored images to be scarier than the cartoonish images in the re release of scary stories to tell in the dark,0
the description said stephen gammell as artist and it was not i was very disappointed to discover that the copies i ordered the scary trilogy while described as being illustrated by stephen gammell were actually the updated versions with watered down artwork by another artist i am not keeping this books as they are worthless to me without the better artwork this is the first time i have been disappointed with an order from amazon but it a big one you need to change your description to include the correct illustrator,0
disappointed this video was let down the historical blurb at the beginning is a time waster and a pain to fast forward thru every time i want to practice dancing i agree with other reviewers regarding the time devoted to freestyle and improvisation i am too new at this to recognize the moves when they are put together so quickly and without any commentary i find myself struggling during this part or worse just standing there feeling frustrated and foolish some instruction regarding transitions from one move to another would have been appreciated on the positive side the actual breakdown of moves was very helpful especially the belly roll and undulations i was really struggling with those and i am now confidently on my way i wish they had covered more moves in that manner bottom line it been a week and i am already seeking out another video to buy,0
tongue hurt my ankle the shoe seemed nice i purchased the NUMBER e version since i read in another review that they can be tight unfortunately the top of the tongue bit into my ankle when i tied the shoe did not matter which sock i wore i had to return,0
buy the NUMBER version instead i bought this book thinking it would be an updated and improved version of the NUMBER bookarmed and female twelve million american women own guns should you by the same author that book was excellent and i wanted to have the latest version unfortunately what i received was a much more expensive pamphlet only NUMBER pages for over ten dollars that abounds with typographical errors to the point that the errors change the meaning of the sentence in several places as if that were not enough much of the content appears to have been cribbed from various blogs and web pages that can be read for free after a simple google search to sum up the NUMBER version of armed and female is a well written and interesting resource albeit slightly dated in technical recommendations on ammunition calibers and of course the makes and models of available handguns this book is unfortunately only an overpriced badly printed rehash of information available elsewhere,0
protection advice all of paxton quigleys self protection books are written for women but are in general excellent advice for both sexes men are usually stronger larger than most women so a well trained female in the use of a firearm and the knowledge of when to use it in todays society is almost a necessity i purchased these books as gifts for the women i care about as a guide which points them in the correct direction,1
know the source of your information while there is some very good information in the book i ask you to consider the source ms quigley has testified on behalf of a woman shooting a gun down a hillside toward a strip mall at some dogs that were barking but not approaching her that she was acting reasonably the jury disagreed and convicted the defendant she was testifying for of grossly negligent discharge of a firearm her approach is a bit aggressive,0
great movie and terrific views of the dingle peninsula we visited the dingle peninsula of ireland this fall and had to see this movie that was filmed there turns out that in addition to having great scenes of the dingle countryside it also has a very good story line and terrific acting and some irish history thrown in for good measure,1
viewed it yesterday this movie would make a great opera adaptation dare i say sara miles carries the movie more than the david lean imprint and the obnoxiously heavy handed score,1
ryan revenge a surprisingly bad film painfully slow paced and convoluted it really is one hell of a mess the exploitation of a pitiful malformed character played by john mills is so over the top insensitive and with a tasteless comic bent and so frequently employed that it demands mention the story feels minor to begin with but is so disjointed and inane that it is best described as no story at all the music is hard to describe i will be kind it not helpful the only reason to see this film is for the absolutely gorgeous almost hypnotic cinematography that and perhaps a young and radiant sarah miles that should have been enough to save this film with some tough and aggressive editing and just a little devotion to good taste but instead we are forced to endure some kind of a personal or career psychosis by a great director david lean,0
excellant movie and seller i saw this movie when it first came out it was hauntingly beautiful i am so happy to get it on dvd some may find it a little slow in areas but i loved it if you appreciate the work of david lean and the acting of sarah miles and robert mitchum then you will love this it ranks right up there for me with dr zhivago which i also had the pleasure of seeing when it first came out on the big screen a wonderful epic movie the seller was extremely prompt and made the purchase feel as though i was buying from a friend way to do business,1
it sounds great it sounds great i am just wondering y it did not already have NUMBER stars di u think it would be great NUMBER my NUMBER year old,0
it a very reliable printer i love my photosmart NUMBER but was a little discouraged when the driver for xp was not available the neat thing about this printer is if you mainly use it to print photos from a memory card you do not have to be connected to your pc just know which numbers you want to print enter and off it goes the quality of my prints has been great right now it connected to my imac and is doing splendidly it quite dependable and not expensive i recommend it highly,1
grindhouse i guess i am not totally up on the meaning of grindhouse one would assume by the title and the tags that these would be sex filled movies with a little plot thrown in for good measure they were full of slow moving plot and sex scenes that would make a censor in the NUMBER s proud,0
am i missing something sorry about the NUMBER star rating it is not for the book content i can not read it but for the horrible way it displays on my ipad the cover page is nice and big fills the screen and looks great ever subsequent page however is about half size meaning that two pages fit across the ipad screen and the font is too small to be readable furthermore the ipad version only allows landscape viewing and the stupid kindle app remains in this orientation after returning to my books list and moving on to another book am i missing something here,0
is honesty always rewarded puss in boots is a wonderful story this book is so beautiful that is like a precious work of art a great read aloud with exceptional illustrations children and adults adore it presenting this tale to children takes great thought though try to avoid the dishonesty terrorism and thievery and focus on resourcefulness first impressions and survival fred marcellino is one of the top illustrators of our time wish he had a website,1
love this book i read this entire book from front to back in NUMBER day it was great full of useful information and makes you feel that you can do this wether your the initiator or not,1
awesome if not overplayed the first NUMBER songs are incredible and the rest are ok i live in france and chumbawamba never got really big there so i have not heard tubthumping a zillion times which makes it still interesting to listen to,1
a great cd for all people i got this cd about a year and a half ago and i still listen to it it is a very good cd with about NUMBER good dance tracks plus the trumpet playing is great i also liked on how smoothly the music and the vocals came together this is truly a masterpiece,1
beyond the mega hit preview of better things to come besides the much maligned mega hit tubthumping which i did not like when it was first released but like now this is a solid cd with great arrangements lyrics and performances it not perfect but how many cd are perfect these days i have recently discovered ready mades and then some clearly a NUMBER star effort and a symposium on how to arrange a song masterfully done i will not write a song by song critique here because several other reviewers have done a more than adequate job of that however i do put forward a challenge to rtbarry in az to move beyond his very own drivel masquerading as a review if he is capable to explain in detail what in his opinion is lacking in this cd that rates it only one star or does he believe we are supposed to obey his fiat review as if he were kim jong il of north korea otherwise rtbarry do not waste our time with drivel,1
it great this is really a great cd chumbawamba has many political and social thoughts you just have to understand them,1
the one star the one star is for the only one good song on this cd tubthumping actually this song blows after you hear it more than NUMBER times this cd has only been in my cd player once that is the day i bought it if you like wasting money buy this cd,0
i will not buy one again i have had mine for about two years i love the color it gives but it has also given me a lot of problems something has gone wrong with the memory inside making it impossible to print in best quality an error message will pop up on my screen and then it will start printing out garbled junk i have down loaded the latest driver more than once but with no success it has been a waste of money to me especially when ink cartridges are so high for it,0
non computer geek stay away from this printer i have had a hp NUMBER and had moderate success with it after a few months the multiple paper pickup and jam problem kept occuring with no satisfactory fix i just got this printer and it is even worse it does not print correctly and multiple jams even after two hours out of the box the copy was consistantly misaligned i am sending it back,0
curved thomas the train tracks again a good product but over priced i would try to find some gently used ones,0
o o okay did i read a different book from everyone else i thought this was horrible i mean how demeaning to women to imply and then prove that a man would best a woman in strength every time even a woman with fighting skills then this whiny main character that regardless of all the obvious hands on facts that prove sabin is an honest honorable man she still calls foul and continues to abuse him in the worst way yet he continues to chase her help her and love her regardless when everything is added up moriah does not deserve a man like sabin lastly to top it all off after she unloaded abuse after abuse on him he simply tells her he a good guy and she like oh well in that case i believe you and i love you how utterly stupid his actions obviously mean nothing but she will listen to what he says wham bam terrible just terrible,0
heads above the first book in the trilogy i was so disappointed in the first book foundation i gave it two stars i have been wanting to read the trilogy for years and i could not believe that that mediocre pulp was it but foundation and empire is the saving grace i look forward to the next book,1
good book i liked this book i do not really have anything profound to say i am only writing a review because for some reason amazon is not giving me the option of rating the book without a review asimov seems to have an interesting twist on european history in this book as the events that occur in it seem to parallel the fall of the roman empire the successor germanic kingdoms and the rise of the merchant class in the renaissance understanding the history of western civilization probably has given me a fun comparison to asimov fictional galactic history,1
fantastic sci fi classic the foundation novels are superb i went on to read the entire original trilogy the first foundation book being my favorite the story jumps ahead by leaps and bounds between sections which can be confusing at first but ends up making for a fantastic treat can not recommend this series highly enough for any scifi fan,1
phenomenal i can not recommend foundation and its entire series highly enough when it comes to worldbuilding and examining the possibilities of earth future asimov does it best his entire basis is that intelligence learning and confrontation of the unknown will be our salvation instead of ignorance or seeing who carries the biggest gun a welcome change,1
good politics but no science the book starts with an enticing psychohistory idea but then it dives deep into politics it is quite interesting to read the ingenious solutions for the crises taken by the great leaders of the foundation specially for resigning war whenever it seemed the most sensible way out the problem is that this book is supposed to be science fiction yet the story seemed to have happened back in the mercantilism period in the xvii century with its priests kings viceroys and merchant ships trading raw materials for manufactured goods the gadgets used by the traders to fool the other empires are a bit silly as well for a far future based science fiction,0
asimow is one of the best writers of all times foundation and all the other books that complete the extense colection are wonderful i remember when i read this book NUMBER years ago and as you see i still love it if you do not want to read all the books of the series you do not have to do it the saga of foundation it only three books foundation foundation and empire and second foundation but if you want to read a good good good gooooooooood series of books read them all you will not regret it i really loved all this books,1
classic isaac asimov is an exception author in any genre he just happens to write in science fiction his foundation novels are at the apex of classic science fiction if you are going to read only one book in this genre then this is the one to choose the universe he creates is so vivid that the book is difficult to put down in case you could not tell i am a fan,1
do not bother prelude to foundation is excellent however you should stop there foundation is bad this book is totally predictable read dune if you want something intelligent and entertaining read foundation if you want something that you probably will not even finish,0
tough going i got pretty bogged down with the multiple characters and places and time periods not a good book to pick up occasionally takes a focussed reading and that just one of the series,0
dissatified i was dissatisfied with this novel being an avid fan of asimov and the foundation series the younger version of the mathimatical genius did not match with older one who changed the history of his race for the better nor did i think that the story with female very appealing again it did not match the story seemed tacked on to the series just to write another novel it is unfortunate that the writer who invented the positronic brain the three law of robotics and of course the genuis of the foundation series wrote such a tacked on story,0
goes haywire regularly setup was easy enough but this printer routinely goes haywire spitting out a whole cartridge load of paper and refusing to print i have tried it with several different pcs with this same intermittent weird behavior only a reset of both the printerand the computer seem to fix everything i am off to buy an epson,0
old fashioned sweet story not much of a challenge to read enjoyed it just the same it was a change from the modern world and therefore i recommend it,1
stay away this just plain bad boring i did not find this the least bit entertaining nor interesting it was a waste of my time,0
worst movie ever go break open a red light camera and steal the film watch that it will have NUMBER NUMBER times better acting and a much more coherent plot too,0
blu ray review what a terrible movie garbage it totally sucks what is hollywood coming to it seems they are running out of stories to make movies about what garbage good lord right up there with boondock saints NUMBER and smokin aces NUMBER,0
last nicolas cage film for me there is not one redeemable quality about this film period nicolas cage is at the bottom of the barrel he now has absolutely no range the acting in this was worse than a low budget b movie i think he seriously was on something so here we are new orleans post katrina nic is supposed to be a tough guy and gets into all kinds of trouble i could not figure out who was coming or going i was baffled the entire movie the lines were horrible please save your money,0
what did i watch so he a dirty cop and an all around horrible person spoiler everything worked out in the end what the heck was the point of that movie seriously everything worked out in the end i do not know why i continued to watch,0
great writing i think the above review needs a corrective tynan was the sharpest funniest and best informed theatre critic of his generation he was also a wonderful stylist and a precocious one many writers never write as well as tynan did while still in his teens these letters can be enjoyed simply for their manipulation of language but there more to them than that tynan always liked to think of himself as an outsider as someone pushing the envelope yet he also was entranced by the establishment at play and he enjoyed lowbrow entertainment almost as much as shakespeare and sophocles these letters demonstrate this bifurcation of character making for a sort of un selfconscious autobiography well worth buying for anyone who likes reading letters and a must for tynan fans when can we have some more of his work reisssued,1
if you can not make it to mongolia this season mykel board punk rocker new yorker gonzo provocateur fulfills a lifetime dream by moving to mongolia for one year to teach english and i am so glad he did his easy to read writing style is brutally honest and hysterically funny from his problems overcoming constipation because metamucil is not sold in outer mongolia board resorts to consuming rancid street food to encourage diarrhea to his visits to mongolian dance clubs to the confusing hurdles presented in this post soviet limbo land welcome to mongolia is the standard response from natives when cultural idiosyncracies are brought to attention unlike most travel memoirs there are no overwrought or pretentious analyses of a foreign culture even though there were times that i a fellow traveler longed for mykel to take a deeper look at this rarely examined country making this book a fun unrestrained ride through a remote kafka esque kingdom buy this book,1
banal and boring no i am not making this up somebody actually produced this recording actually two people produced it nearly two string quartets were assembled to play on it i say nearly because most of the tracks were played by a trio who apparently used overdubbing to inflate themselves into a quartet i am not sure that any string quartet could have made this music seem appropriate or entertaining these folks certainly were not up to the task the end result is so banal and boring that it does not even work as a novelty record that might be fun to play at parties unbelievable,0
great item i find this item to be more than expectedand i think everyone should consider buying onei will tell everyone about it,1
amazing score wow words can barely express the awesomeness of this piece first i will start with the movie brilliant that is all there is to be said about the film now the ost beautiful work a very dark and somber piece very moody and atmospheric its not something you just listen to for fun at least for me its more of a background music while doing your business its just brilliant every track in amazing from beginning to end i was unfamiliar with johnny klimek and reinhold heild work this cd however makes me want to definatly look into it it is the perfect sound to go along with the dark nature of the film some tracks are very tranquil and moody while others pound out beats and are very fast paced all in all a NUMBER NUMBER for the cd a definate must have for any collection highly recommneded,1
do not buy this camera its a very nice camera do not get me wrong however due to its compact design the speaker is too close to the tape motor during quiet and not so quiet areas you will hear a high pitched humm coming from your camera as well as on what you record canon confirmed this as a design flaw the zr NUMBER NUMBER and NUMBER all do this i was really disappointed i returned mine i wish there was a way to fix it,0
brio medium straight track brio is the most durable and has the best quality wooden train on the market these pieces are a must for extending your existing train set my NUMBER year old loves having these extra pieces to create with,1
it too simple even for a kiss book i know the whole point of dummie and kiss books is that they are supposed to be easy for anyone to understand but this book was too simple too basic i read a chapter and could hardly bear to invest anymore time in it since the information was so sparse if i had not gotten this book for a steal i would have been very upset at my waste of money there was just no real information what a waste,0
quality from tripp lite as always i always goes with the trip lite fiber patch cables due to their quality and not being so proud of their name they triple the price,1
awful big waste of money after washing noticed NUMBER pillow case was a different shade and so wrinkled no matter what i have tried stuck with it since i washed and can not find packaging,0
good grill for the money i have been very happy with this easy to use and clean grill i have used it to grill steaks duck breasts veggies and chicken takes longer than a gas grill but gets to job done without smoking up the kitchen,1
excessive typos ruined it for me could not agree more w prendergast review concerning the laughable typos i thought the proof reader or editor of the version i had must be abusing drugs themselves how distracting to read a so called classic and find it reading like a hs sophomore paper and a drunk sophomore at that i somehow managed to finish the book but came on amazon immediately following it to see if others read the same erroneous version weird typos poor punctuation etc ruined it for me,0
entertaining action movie spoilers the main reason why i waited up until NUMBER in the morning cause i am a fan of chris lambert i saw it id say it was excellent of the action and the acting done by chris lambert and ice t great action and i was dissapionted when christopher lambert was told by marcus that he killed his daughter when he did not and so they killed each other and that ugly old woman who can t even act probably old enough to look like shes NUMBER mabye she is so it was very entaining worth a watch,1
one more positive note do not know if anyone else has addresed this i have been building my barn shop for NUMBER years now the book covers many of my thoughts and concerns would have wanted this sooner than later points raised for consideration noise and sound i put in some wood walls painted white and sealed against moisture but i fussed with that or drywall i considered my own sound issues and went with wood but after reading some of the author comments i will be spending extra time for fire protection and sound absorption when i do other parts of the shop not for me alone but for my nieghbors as well good book to read before during or contemplating a shop hey we get to find out about how the masters of wood roughed it as well,1
criminally stupid mistake to not provide the orginal sound do not buy this video with dvd technology it would have been a no brainer to provide both sound tracks the original aussie version and the rotten american dubbed version these dopes chose to give us the one that nobody wants perhaps if nobody buys it they will get a clue,0
this is the movie that introduced me to the awesomeness of action movies of the NUMBER this is probably mel gibson first film a film he done while he was in his NUMBER there is no doubt that he would become a great star in his native australia but this film launched him as an international movie star especially since they released mad max NUMBER which was universally released as the road warrior and the road warrior is one of my top ten favorite films of the NUMBER sure mad max has some of that cheesy seventies style but it definitely introduced us to a new kind of nameless hero which became the common theme of all upcoming action films even being made today mad max is that one film being over NUMBER years old that can still be loved and cherished by people even less than NUMBER years old today this film is a classic in the action hero dramas for movie lovers who enjoy building a respectable movie library amongst their own home theatre,1
great dvd packed with a ton of features i have seen mad max dozens of times but after watching the new se dvd it was like watching it again for the very first time that is not an exaggeration the new dvd offers the choice of the poorly dubbed us soundtrack or the original australian soundtrack watch the original track the pacing of the film changes entirely as do the characters the original soundtrack breathes new life into this film the features are great there a trivia track that pops up info about the production cars and aussie slang terms used as you watch it NUMBER documentaries tv spots theater trailer and more the print is fabulous and it turns out this is a film you really need to see in widescreen having seen it both ways now i can tell you that the pan scanned version misses a lot of the stuntwork and chase scene action if you have seen this movie in the past and thought was ok this new dvd will have you saying was great,1
awful this was the absolute worst book that i have ever read it the dullest most boring thing since i learned algebra after the first chapter i already wanted to kill myself but i gave it another chance and another and another and another i was continually dissapointecd do not waste your hard earned money on this aboration of a book,0
oh my god it stereolab ever since i got this album since last summer i kept on thinking what this album will sound like i never wanted to stop listening to this album because their music is so spectacular if you heard the first track laetitia kinda does the loud humming and someone keeps on playing the synthesizer it reminds me of the beatles eerie song revolution NUMBER from the white album i could have just imagined while listening to baby lulu and it makes your mind clear with soothing and beautiful sounds this is the best album i have ever heard and i listen to this album while i study and you should listen to this while you are at work or home stereolab totally gets your stresses away by listening to them bye bye,1
perfect family fun this is a very funny movie that stars martin short as murray a bumbling fairy god mother who can hardly do anything right his first job is helping anabel greening played by mara wilson anabel wish is that her dad is auditioning for a part in a broadway musical and she wants him to get the part unfortunately murray accidentally turns her dad into a statue when anabel her brother charlie and murray go to nafgaa and tell the queen of the fairy godmothers what happened she tells anabel that if they do not reverse the spell by midnight he will remain a statue forever before they can do that they have to get the wands back from the evil claudia i highly recommend a simple wish,1
great kids movie the kids loved this movie martin short is hillarious the fact that it still teaches kids you do not always get what you ask for,1
funny this movie has the little girl from matilda and martin short good family picture we loved it came in excellent condition,1
excellent album i have known kenneth copland since NUMBER he has always set very high standards for the recording prpduction of all his albums this album is no exception,1
well played kid music trout fishing in america make kids music they do it well and the album probably will stand up to the death play the kids will give it even with adults although i highly doubt many adults will listen to it for it own merits if you need a cd for your kids to listen to that will not drive you crazy you have found it but otherwise this is probably not a cd you want to own,1
highway robbery it always amazes me how some outside vendors try to gouge consumers with their highly over priced items on here you can bet i will never buy anything from this vendor even if it is a great deal this is a ridiculously high price for red bull on sale in the stores one can find it for NUMBER NUMBER can why would someone pay more than that online caveat emptor let the buyer beware,0
well i also really loved the book it showed two strong willed people who are at first glance totally wrong for each other i mean a centuries old vampire and a vampire slayer it was ironic i also liked that even though quin was a cold fish on the outside inside he was just as lonely as rashel even if he rarely admitted it i loved the book and could not put it down if u have not read it yet do so,1
where are the woodwinds the performances seem fine the recording is a mess the woodwinds are lost in the intro to festive overture because there is too much reverberation the mics must have been placed in the back of an empty hall more like a cavern this is a real disappointment because the orchestra is outstanding this is a one listen cd then file it away forever,0
vivid colors tight fit only lasts a few times this puzzle has lovely graphics and a sturdy construction as others have mentioned the pieces are tight and difficult to maneuver right out of the box because they are all wood and cut from one piece after about three uses however they are now smooth and fit together well i have not had a problem with splinters but if you are too rough when you first break apart the pieces i could see how splinters might develop my NUMBER month old daughter loves this puzzle and had no trouble putting it together without a visual guide the colors of each area are very distinguishable so it pretty easy to determine where each piece connects we are happy customers,1
these shoes are made for walking in the merrill way these are great shoes as my daughter says merrills are a hug for the feet even though there are minimal straps they are in the right places and adjustable these go everywhere i love them,1
persuasive book with an unusual approach the book details many or most of the important dynamics of the war as it took place within a single provice in the process bergerud reveals much about what is important to know about the war as a whole for me personally this is possibly the most important vietnam book i have read this is because it provided me a framework for understanding the war from the beginning of american involvement to the end that i still use for many readers this could be an important first book to read about vietnam and america relations to it,1
another sensual gem from this composer this is yet another lush shimmering pscyo erotic opera by franz schreker wonderfully performed by the forces involved i suggest you just read the review of NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER to get a good summary of the surreal plot at least one other reviewer has termed it not as a good as the composer masterpiece die gezeichneten and while i would not disagree with that judgement this music drama comes pretty close to matching its sibling particularly in the second half other than mozart bizet carmen and a small handful of others i am not a great opera fan but schreker output in this genre to be absolutely stunning highly recommended,1

you will enjoy this cd i got a huge kick out of vinny interpretations of the beatles songs that they never recorded sure they ver due elements from the later years that they should have skipped as has been written here but the do not mimic previous covers but try to recreate the early beatle sound it light and it fun it is not a must have as a beatles fan but i think you will get a big kick out of this disc,1
madonna is a great singer madonna is a great singer who sings an even better musical she is so full of emotion that on her last wispers of lament it actually sounds like she is about to enter immortality while in the song beuonos aires she sounds like a ambitious young girl yelling for attention she is a great actor if i could change one thing it would be to switch jimmy nail and jonathin pryce because nail should sing more songs and price should sing less,1
evita evita evita evita evita evita all i can say is wow i never thought madonna could sing like this now i am a huge fan of hers antonio banderas accent makes him fit the part of che very nicely the songs are incomparable if i could change one thing it would be jonathan pryce because he has an annoying voice,1
disappointed in product quality and support after returning the first version of this product because of constant paper jams the replacement would not recognize the printer drivers from the first or allow me to replace them in trying to overcome this through hp support line the recorded message said i would be directed to a representative and then promptly cut off the call twice returned that version also,0
a text book worth keeping for reference this is a text book that i will not be selling back i like the reference style set up with tabbed pages i am sure i will be referring to it throughout the rest of my college courses,1
a small leak right out of the box i had to try sleeping on it the first night in a couple of hours it was less firm which made it difficult to roll around on it did not take long to realize that buying this bed was a mistake returning it will be very difficult because it is almost impossible to fit it back in its original carton because one can not evacuate all of the residual air necessary to make it fold up small enough prospective buyers should be mindful of this,0
did not last long we used this for less than NUMBER days for a guest it does everything as advertised except that it began to leak air by the time you wake up in the morning it has shrunk to less than half it inflated height there is a patch kit included but we could not find where the air was coming out we had to return it to amazon we bought a single folding bed instead with a memory foam mattress not compact but less risky than an airbed,0
it a great value i purchased a twin size intex pillow airbed and was so impressed with the quality that i ordered a second it was easy to inflate held it firmness was very easy to take down and easily stored now when my granddaughters come to visit they have their own bed and great pajama parties,1
great bed for guests i highly recommend this item and it a great price with amazon prime my son uses this whenever he sleeps over he loves it says that it like sleeping on a cloud with the electric pump which is attached it inflates and deflates super fast it also folds up into a rather small rectangle and it comes with a canvas bag for store,1
comfortable sleep i found this air bed to be perfect for NUMBER person the ease in filling the height all exceptional i would reccomend this bed to anyone,1
intex pillow rest twin airbed with built in electric pump this product is very difficult for me to use the air pump does not connect easily and i would not recommend it,0
great bed for guests bought this for my grandson to sleep on when the family came to visit over christmas it is wonderful super easy to inflate and deflate nicely raised off the floor and he said it was very comfortable grandma scored a home run on this one,1
intex pillow rest twin airbed with built in electric pump excellent value for the money convenient and comfortable i just wish it was a little higher i would recommend this product,1
do not buy inflates like a charm then deflates under the weight of a child within NUMBER hours i should have gone with my gut and purchased another aerobed because the one i already have queen has worked for NUMBER years,0
it would be great if it stayed inflated i have purchased two of these air mattresses when inflated they are great but during the night they slowing deflate i have yet to discover how to keep these mattresses inflated for eight full hours i wish i would have bought a different air mattress,0
valve broke after a couple of uses my mother bought this bed for my NUMBER year old to use when we visited on weekends worked great the first NUMBER or so times she used it but now the valve that lets the air out will not close it spins but does not seal shut so you can not inflate the mattress very poor quality,0
ecelente producto funciono sin ningun inconveniente de acuerdo a lo informado en las caracteristicas recomiedo el mismo a todo el que necesite un colchon inflabe comodo y de rapido armado muy bueno el sistema de bomba de aire incorporado al mismo elemento no esnecesario nada mas para utilizarlo,1
would never buy again this is the third mattress in NUMBER or NUMBER weeks and had the same problem with all three they all leaked right from the beginning some worse then the others the built in pump worked great and i liked it very much thus the NUMBER stars instead of one star i am very thankful for amazon great return policy it was really a pleasure to deal with them,0
intex pillow rest twin mattress is a flop we bought these beds in september for our grandchildren to sleep on when they visit they are NUMBER and NUMBER and weigh under NUMBER pounds these beds can not make it through one single night inflated we either have to get up during the night and re inflate them or the kids will wake us up because the mattresses have lost so much air they are uncomfortable we have had to repair both beds because they develop pin holes from being folded when we put them away and you can hear air escaping around the area where the beds inflate themselves i am very disappointed in this product and will not buy another air mattress from this company since it clear their quality has gone down hill drastically since we bought their double bed seven years ago my opinion is save your money and find another solution for guests to sleep on that what we are doing now,0
comfortable i bought this air mattress after researching the site it is indeed very comfortable and easy to operate and most important of all no leaking,1
disappointed but should not be surprised i saw several people had written about air leaks but at that point the majority appeared to be happy with their purchase we ordered two twins for our camp mine started leaking immediately my husbands seemed to be good from spring to nearly winter when his too began to leak so bad that both of us were pumping air several times during the night to keep a little bit afloat that was bad enough but having several friends and family in our bunk house part of the camp awake while doing this pushed it over the edge my father in law bought the same time my husbands started going down hill so it should be interesting to see if it happens again our camp closes down during winter so spring will be the big test i suspect we will go with something a little more expensive and not regret wasting the money we did on these then again my hubby is very good at fixing things so maybe there hope,0
works well the air mattress does blow up in seconds it is comfortable it is a little difficult to wrap up and the plug is a little difficult to put back but all and all it was well worth the money my daughter is using it until she can get her new baby to sleep through the night,1
great for the summer my daughter is living with a couple for the summer this was an alternative to transporting a regular twin bed NUMBER miles to their house she has been very pleased with the quality and ease of use that is a big deal with her as she has two steel rods in her back as a college student and missions student i am sure it will be used again,1
quick and easy this bed is so easy to use just plug it in turn it on and walk away the pump is built in so you do not have to worry about keeping up with an air pump using a hairdryer or finding double d batteries to power your pump,1
love it we recently moved into a smaller place when my parents came into town they took my oldest sons room we needed something for him to sleep on but did not have much room this twin airbed by intex is great i love the fact that the pump is built in it does not get in the way like i thought it might my son says it very comfortable it easy to inflate and deflate,1
great find at a great price i needed to replace my airbed but did not want to spend a fortune this one works great and it was very economical in comparison to the ones i found in my local bed and bath store,1
its better then a normal bed i just moved out of my moms house and i want to bring my huge bed dressar with me so i got the airbed its been NUMBER months since i moved out and i am still sleeping on it you can have it fully inflated for a very firm bed or deflate it for a softer bed i like mine halfway deflated its like sleeping on a cloud,1
electric pump failed took it to france and electric pump only worked for a minute and blew bought a hand pump to pump it up it was a painful job after it was fully pumped the bed was rather comfortable decided not to bring home to return because once it was pumped there was no way to deflate to the extend that it would fit back into the original box,0
excellent product for the price durable and extremely comfortable loses a little air over extended use but adding air very easy,1
great mattress i am in iraq and this mattress is great it is NUMBER x more comfortable then the things they call mattresses over here,1
would not recommend i bought this for my off campus residence and the two months it worked fine and then the problems began first two the curves on the top not sure what exactly they are called merged into one so i had to sleep on one half of the bed recently i noticed it was starting to sink and re inflated it shortly afterward i heard some air and found where it was leaking and did not think too much off it then in the middle of sleeping i woke up on the floor and then just gave up on it and now am having to resort to sleeping on the floor tried calling their customer support line and it was backed up then i found out that the main support line is for their pools i would recommend a different brand like coleman or getting something from cabela,0
is loosing air with almost no use i bought this airbed on october NUMBER i only used it NUMBER times and now is loosing air how can it loose air like that with only NUMBER uses at the beginning it seams good because is comfortable and tall but now i can not use it anymore unless i want fill it with air at the middle of the night,0
the best air mattress ever i love this air mattress so much it is so easy to inflate and deflate and it is quick too it is very sturdy and durable as well over all it is an excellent gift to anyone who expects to travel and stay over at someone place or even if you have a lot of guests yourself,1
fantastic bought the intex pillow rest for visits visitors inflation is quick quiet and easy deflation works the same slight loss of air by early morning fits back into tote nicely take an extra moment when flattened to tuck the sides between the upper and lower fabric fold in thirds length wise then role from bottom toward pump pillow end easy to tote and store,1
better than the queen size bed i bought this to replace my queen size intex bed that exploded inside only lasted NUMBER months i like the twin size way better because it feels more reliable with full air than the queen size i think the queen size was just too big that too much weigh in one area caused the explosion inside the twin size is just perfect and it makes my room look even bigger if you are looking for a bed for just yourself this should be perfect,1
step best work so far i have been a fan of step rideau and the zydeco outlaws since i purchased their cd standing room only i am so glad has quickly become my favorite some tunes are folksy with a zydeco flare and others are very zydeco this is a must buy for zydeco lovers if the grammys had a catagory for zydeco step would win for performer of the year,1
NUMBER bucks i paid NUMBER at comp usa known for being overpriced over a year ago anyways the case does not get the best air so i recommend getting more fans if you have problems with the front usb hubs pc freezes when you plug something in them unplug the very bottom black wire r r w w g g b b b,1
dvd review very good comprehensive review on the band gives good insight into the individual members and why some of their songs were written a good addition to my collection,1
not worth the money not what i thought i was getting i do not think jell is as enjoyable as the silicone and unfortunately i had to pay to find out,0
good it was good is not like out of this world and really amazing but it works soooooo good if you put a lot of pressure when your using it it turns off automatically that sucks,1
too expensive i used it once and have not touched it since the dolfin will not stay on my clit and the clear stuuf is too soft waste of money,0
no way this product worked for NUMBER times the the rotation stopped working batteries run out or lose power after NUMBER uses i would read reviews before buying another one i am looking into the hitachi wand massager now and i believe i will buy it since is a power operated toy and will never run out of power not impressed with this product,0
not worth the money what a let down i was so excited to get this because of the reviews but when i tried it it did nothing first it is very heavy and hard to hold if you are using it by yourself second it hurts your clitoris it is very sharp on the ears that the part that goes on you clit i am almost temped to cut them off third and forth it smells and it is very loud i have tried it about NUMBER times trying to get used to it my husband has tried to use it on me too no luck at all this is not worth the money,0
great prodct for those wondering like myself this does come in a discrete package now as for the actual product omg i have never felt something like this before this is my first official toy and i am sooooo pleased it a little large and kinda hard but that okay works wonderfully i would definitely recommend especially for the price,1
awful this was much bigger then i had anticipated that being my own fault but the reason i gave it only NUMBER star is because the plastic was so hard it hurt the bunny for my clit irritated it and was not one bit pleasurable so my man suggested i turn it around and then my taint became irritated not one bit pleased with this product,0
too big while i love the jack rabbit feature the vibrator is overall too big for me to use i can sort slip it inside but its tight and not very comfortable maybe because its too big i can not feel the beads at all i do not think they have any room to move the vibrator is also quite heavy it would be perfect if it were more slender so girls who are not very big down there might not want to buy this product,0
awful i was misguided by the review ratings in all honesty this product is awful it has a toxic smell to it and the bunny ears cause more pain than pleasure i do not recommend this product,0
hate it i am very hard to please because i like both clitoral stimulation and vaginal penitration this item does not work for what i intended it for i tried it twice and hated it both times i was so worked up from trying to make it work that i had to switch back to my bullet i gave it to my best friend after swabing it down with rubing alcohol she loves it she says it does the trick but it is deff not for me,0
fantastic and fast this is definitely better than my last jackrabbit and much higher quality i got the clear one cause like other reviews say your eye really does not jump to it if it is left out and it just looks more mature and less bubble gum my first vibrator hahaha it really quiet for something that moves does so much and it is more powerful than i expected i had to keep it on the medium settings for both the rotation and vibration but even that got the job down in NUMBER seconds yeah i timed it this might take some getting used to for some but i absolutely love it the only downside of this is that the rabbit ears part needs to be a little more lifted off the shaft so you can position it in more ways over you than just the one people have been complaining of a weird plastic smell and it kind of does have a smell but only if you physically put your nose right on the thing and inhale and it went away after NUMBER or NUMBER washes i highly recommend buying this,1
after NUMBER years this album is still awesome this album contains danceable techno and mellow techno trancey ambient unlike most albums all of the songs on this album are great you will definitely get your money worth from this album and even though it over NUMBER years old the music still sounds brilliant like michael stipe of r e m said this album was several years ahead of its time,1
i am glad i did not pay for it i received this as a christmas gift from a friend who knows i like hot tea all of the tea was some variation on flavors of green tea i avoid drinking caffein which green tea contains so i gave away all of the tea and kept the chest to fill with my own selections the chest is kind of cheap paper glued over something as described by another reviewer it pretty but i do not expect it to hold up,0
great book this book gives a great look into the jewish mindset of the early NUMBER s a must read for any young bible student,1
streisand live in concert NUMBER cd good this is a good double cd packed with alot of favorites i liked slot of her dialouges between songs her words messages are invaluble timeless il divo accompanies her on several songs like evergreen i would have preferred her to sing that one alone the music of the night somewhere not favorable with il divo,1
come on you have got to be kidding ok first of all i was looking for lighthouse the classic pop rock group there was nothing to tell me that this album was a gospel cd ok i can live with that so i listen to my new lighthouse gospel cd let me tell you i was not impressed the engineering sucked the music was mmmmmmm ok i guess and the singing really had no feeling or substance behind it so if you are into gospel steer clean and if you are looking for lighthouse the classic pop rock group this is not it latter,0
misleading photo there was little information about the product other than the photo which showed the watchtower toys with NUMBER action figures we thought that the NUMBER action figures were included they were not also do not be fooled by the too good to be true price they charge so much for shipping it costs the same as you would pay in a store otherwise the package arrived in a timely manner was in good condition and appeared to be from a legitamate supplier,0
waste of money if you get to this review please please do not spend your hard earned money on this toy even at half price it is not worth it i faced the same problems as everyone else i am forced to use my own glue and take time out to re work the toy so that it does what it was supposed to out of the box a watse of money nuff said,0
what a waste after an hour of trying to put the tower together we gave up the legs kept falling off making the tower fall over and the lever did not make the doors open this was a major disapointment we returned it the next day in pieces,0
slick looking components are older technology keyboard sucks picked one of these up the other day mostly for the slick design and for the wireless keyboard with trackball type mouse controller but that all it has is looks after using the keyboard it quickly became tedious to use since not only are the keys hard to push down they are in a tight proximity of each other and not in the usual places and the wireless is hit and miss possibly because it runs at only NUMBER mhz frequency it will miss keys here and there so you have to type very slooow and check your work very often and with passwords where you can not see what you are typing good luck it quickly becomes a tire there is no number pad and the trackball mouse is skippy and lacks a scroll feature the processor is NUMBER generations older than the current dual core intel processors and the ram is standard ddr instead of ddr NUMBER unless hp updates the components and the keyboard this is a terrible value and a pos,0
confused i downloaded the sample and could barely get though the first chapter the authors writing felt very juvenile and kept mixing american with london slang honestly it was the dumbest book i have tried to read in a long time at least download the sample first,0
great deliver of all products fast delivery of all products we just received the bunn coffee maker this is the fourth bunn coffee maker we have purchased over thirty years great product the book and the hair iron were gifts so we do not know how they were liked,1
romeo and juliet the tragic story romeo and juliet is the story of two young children who decided to live their forbidden love although their parents were terrible enemies because of this their lives ended with their tragic deaths making their families agree in what for years they were fighting for i like this story because it shows the bravery young people have without caring what adults say they should have thought this better so their would not have ended in the tragic way they did both of them committing a tragic suicide this tragic also affected other lives such as their parents which suffered a lot for them,1
oh romeo stupid teenagers a boy who falls out of love as quickly as he falls in and poor communication shakespeare got teenage romance down pat,0
a good introduction to the tragedies romeo and juliet is a beautiful story and it is a marvellous play to introduce young people to the beauty of shakespeare who does not like to read or hear about star crossed lovers who has not already heard the legend the play is easy to read as the plot moves along rapidly and it beautifully written romeo and juliet are so tragic in their love and the silly feud between their two families is so destructive and senseless read it for the story but enjoy it for the beautiful prose,1
romeo and juliet we think that the book was a great influence to our english because it had a very difficult language so we had to look for the words all the time in the dictionary and that way we learn two things to look up words in the dictionary and new words we liked the end when all the main characters died it left me a great message if it was not for the video the school hired at the videoclub we had not understand it and the video is a bit boring also but we only liked it because leonardo di caprio acted as romeo in the video,0
good book but not this edition this is an excellent book but this edition is extremely poorly produced there are far too many typos and little information about the original publication of the book for example the layout is ugly it great the book is cheap but i wish i had paid a little more for a nicer version,0
how do films like this get made if this is not the worst movie i have ever seen it certainly is in the running i would point out all the absurdities in the film but it would be much easier and less time consuming to just list the positives so here goes kevin sorbo while delivering a truly pathetic performance i swear he must have been drinking while filming this looked to be in fairly good shape that it,0
what the heck the uniforms were ridiculous mixing ribbons and stripes on officer uniforms the technical advisor should be fired i had to rewind the movie several times as it put me to sleep kevin sorbo puleeze do not get roped into making these bovine feces type movies again a real stinker,0
cute but a little cheap this is a nice costume but the material is quite cheap also it makes my bust look strange because the black part is right in the middle of it but the bottom part is really cute i love the polka dots on the inner layer of the skirt i just do not really like it myself i think it could be better,0
disappointed i am glad i read the reviews i agree if i can not choose my color i do not want to order there is another box very similar does not lock where i can choose my color that one i will order thanks for all your reviews,0
no color no buy i wanted very much to get a blue one for my grand daughter but was afraid i end up with black so a lost sale for this company sorry,0
not classic yello but very very good not everyone can like every album but for me one second is my all time favorite i have listed to it regularly since it was first released and have never tired of the complex rhythms and musical variety that it offers one second is different from yello other albums and in my opinion does not hold as much appeal for someone looking for pure techno while the drum machines and sequencers are certainly there and brilliantly done the sound is less annalog and has more feel it is not background music but rather must be listened to to be enjoyed the latin influence is wonderful and the music sounds as if it were made for shirley bassey style and voice in my mind this album creates its own genre of music which i have yet to find elsewhere it is different but it is very very good,1
disappointed thrilled at my daughter pregnancy i purchased this book for her because i could remember how much i admired it NUMBER years ago when i read it her feedback mom it really good until it gets to homosexuality it fails miserably there i just reread the passage on page NUMBER of the library edition and now i want to throw it out of the public library collection i will not i will keep it for the good parts and try to forgive brigg out dated and misinformed attitude but i will not give it NUMBER stars any more,0
a double edged sword this book is unlike most of the books written on the topic while nuel emmons seems to have started out with an eye on the ball to release new information on manson and the case against him he fell short of his goal by virtue of adding a lot of things which were not really manson in his own words but were nothing more than fabrication,0
manson hates emmons watch charlie on video in an interview and hear for yourself him say emmons took his life and put that in my book then he took my life and wrote a second book with his name on it and said it was his life so he milked you for two books he a good crook the way charlie himself talks about the book indicates that less than NUMBER percent is factual,0
lies lies lies for all of you who are under the illusion that this book is in charlie own words you are mistaken at the time of the so called interviews the author was not allowed any sort of writing utensils tape recorders etc the words you see are those of the authors same old media hype to make a buck the author betrayed charlie by pretending to be his this is why charlie declines so many interviews everybody distorts everything he has ever said so my advice is if you want to read the authors take on charlie buy it if you want the truth do not buy it,0
really cmon now lets get real do you really think that this stuff is going to work especially the trapping so many people love trapping but when then try it in sparring it does not work the lin lop sau the bong lop sau the same hand tan to lop sau cmon now none of that works against anyone who does not leave their hand out there after they throw a punch this may have been how people fought hundreds if not a thousand years ago but it certainly isnt practical now if you want to spend lots of your precious time learning an art that most of it you can not use in sparring or in the street then so be it but like bruce said man or for that matter any person man or woman is more important than any art or system even applies to jkd and wing chun not the other way around,0
i could not put it down nappily ever after was a true page turner i could not put it down venus was a down to earth character that i could relate too you wanted to know how the story turned out by the first chapter i was tempted to read the last chapter right after the first i look forward to more books by trisha r thomas i wish it could have went the other way but the author made it very believable,1
sadly predictable if you do not like to be surprised in the least bit this novel is for you if you do not mind the writer technique or do not see literary language necessary to be entertaining then you too will like this book i on the other did not the plot was predictable the characters were one dimensional and the language reminded me some what of mcmillan an unpolished mcmillan of course the best part of this book was the cover and that was just not enough to keep me satisfied,0
struggled through i struggled through this book the storyline was a bore i was also anxious to read this book as it was highly recommended but too was i disappointed if you absolutely have to read this book borrow it from someone or the library,0
klaatu hopeless i purchased the original klaatu album on vinyl in NUMBER i love the album as much now on cd as it did then however hope is far too theatrical with virtually no actual songs on it if i could give it NUMBER stars i would,0
a must read this book and author were interviewed on friday NUMBER april by bill moyers on pbs fascinating the book is insightful and explains so much we in the west truly do not understand all government officials need to read this well written makes you think,1
a unique take on a classic theme i really enjoyed this book with the exception that the story was slightly disjointed at times there are sudden jumps in the story and one in particular in which a large chunk of plot seems to suddenly go missing aside from these short comings however the science plot work well together the characters are reasonably complex the universe captivating,1
one brave act changes a civilization this story is gripping in part because the NUMBER female protagonists honestly feel they are making the best decisions that will affect the whole crew they are severely opposed to each others approach despite being close friends originally the act of the captain to pursue the fleeing object and thus stranding here crew forever inspires the entire human race to pursue a future in space and fulfill some aspect of a larger destiny that this comet takes them to the end of time and space has its own amazing affect on the crew there is a span of billions of years this book is about responsibility and living up to it including taking ownership for a vision and a mistake great read,1
great dali book great amazon price love the book love dealing with amazon com i have been dealing with amazon for years now and have never had a problem with them thanks once again amazon,1
great space heater it swivels has a remote and a tipover safety feature and you can mount it on the wall if you desire it works wonderfully providing plenty of heat when you need it,1
thorough and interesting look at this most intriguing literary woman after watching the masterpiece theatre presentation of portrait of a marriage years ago i went on a search for more information about the life of vita sackville west this bio was one of the gems overturned in that quest for treasure having only been able to find it in unca library at the time i was delighted to be able to stumble over it again during a search at amazon com i have now made it a permanent addition to my extensive library of a subject i call the three v the three v are vita sackville west violet trefusis and virginia woolf three women joined via literary and emotional attachment with vita sackville west acting as the hinge,1
buyer beware if i only read the reviews before purchasing this for my NUMBER year old i would never have bought it it is very flimsy and top heavy the elevator gets stuck and it does take awhile to put together as i was driving all over town looking for the best price i wondered why no store had the batcave out on display once we got it together i realized why we ended up taking off the bottom poles and moving some of the parts around so it would stop falling over we have lots of batman toys and other mattel products this is by far the biggest disappointment in NUMBER years of toy buying if it was not from santa it would be going back without a doubt buy anything else,0
this will be an additional toy for next spring yard sale our almost NUMBER year old could not wait to get this toy to add to his super hero collection it looks great on the box however this is by far the worst toy we have purchased for any of our kids in almost NUMBER years it is so flimsy and cheaply built pieces fall off and it tips a lot hopefully it will be re designed with sturdier materials if you are considering purchasing it do not you will save your self some money and frustration,0
worst scanner i have owned i was looking forward to a new scanner after my hp died after just a year i purchased this one based on the several good reviews on amazon and other sites now that i have the scanner i am sorely disappointed the picture quality is horrible no matter the tweaking i do in the scanner dialog the picture is faded and grainy the software itself is the least useful interface i have ever worked with the auto buttons makes the image worse the image area recognition has never yet gotten it right and the most useful feature only applies if you are sending the scan to paperport something i never want to do,0

great book for those of you who might think that a clavell novel might be a little too long for you this book is great and the shortest of the six books in the asian saga plus it stands out in its own right as a book that will leave an impression on you emotionally and as a result of reading a good book,1
most interesting ending this is an excellent book and of the clavell books i have read all except gai jin this has the most interesting if not the best ending it seemed to me that clavell got slightly redundant with the natural disaster ending but he managed to avoid it in this book i found that the way the story and the character individual stories were resolved or rather unresolved fit perfectly with the insanity that would be occurring in a wwii prison camp oh yeah the rest of the book is pretty cool too,1
afghan lovers unite this is a great new book from our friends at liesure arts i had so much fun looking at all the new patterns and color combos i recomment this book take it to the yarn store with you and pick a design and then your favorite colors and enjoy,1
complete nuisance i set it up according to the directions clicked the scan button and the contraption made a noise but never began the scanning process uninstalled it then re installed it and the same thing happened complete and utter waste of my time i gave it one star only because it had all the parts in the box,0
bad company the scanner looks nice but very deceiving i bought this scanner because of the name xerox i had it for about NUMBER months and scanned maybe NUMBER sheets now it died xerox after NUMBER weeks of calls now wants me to pay return shipping and they say i will get a refurbished unit bad company,0
does not work you get two sets of dice one that always comes up NUMBER or NUMBER and another set planned to have some family fun with it only fun we had was how it did not work at all the NUMBER set comes up all kinds of numbers what were they thinking with this item,0
decent player while it lasts after a little over a year my zen xtra has stopped playing sound everything else works it just appears to be a faulty headphone jack which is a common problem on creative players on a dinky NUMBER portable i would not expect much but on a NUMBER device this is just unacceptable their warranty period and customer service is a joke go have a look at their forums stay away from creative products there are other alternatives out there,0
poor substitute for an ipod simply not as friendly for functional as an ipod even better ipod integrates perfectly with itunes so that managing music is a snap,0
yet another broken headphone jack after roughly a year of fairly reliable use i have also fallen prey to the faulty headphone jack now i am wondering what to do with an item that i paid nearly NUMBER because the limited warranty conveniently ran out eight or nine months ago limited being somewhat of an understatement no one should ever have to consider fixing and possibly further marring something they paid that much money for a month ago i would have given this item four stars after coming here and seeing so many people with the exact same problem that creative continues to neglect i am outright angry that i am not alone,0
discontinued NUMBER pd NUMBER another reviewer recently advised that this is the model to look for i was just advised at a well known retailer that this model has been discontinued is this true or is this a classic bait and switch technique their current weekly sales circular features this model at a sale price when you get to the store they do not have it but when they look it up in their computer it shows up as discontinued it is difficult to relate reviews to actual products when the reviews you base your buying decision on could be about a different model s from the one you actually buy online or in store the creative labs own website does not give model numbers so they are adding to the confusion,1

review the whole book could have been written in half of its size not very well written due to being too wordy hard to follow,0
wow i actually give this zero stars but had to give it a star due to amazon rules the title is slightly misleading as it is not all about wilson involvment with manson that just a part of it and warning that part contains explicit material if anyone cares to know i know brian wilson is the brains behind the beach boys but this documentary was predominantly about brian this should have been titled brian wilson and the satan featuring the rest of them i have seen other beach boys documentaries even made for tv movies that were better than this jumpy compilation i felt like i was trying to watch a documentary put together by someone who had add,0
basketball not at its best ok as yall might know me i am gamer NUMBER to the game this game is sorta like the first nba street game for the ps NUMBER it has some flaws such as lighting also at points of the game you might say is this game worth NUMBER NUMBER well its worth about NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER its not a good game for portability NUMBER lighting is bad at times NUMBER can be hard for beginners so i suggest that you must know what the first few nba street games are about before buying thsi title ps its a fun game after a while,1
never again i bought this heater and it did not even work on arrival the pilot light came on but nothing else what a waste of time and money,0
reaching for the light i have really enjoyed this book i have been learning a lot for my own healing the reason i bought it was because a few months back i was able to read a portion of the book and i was hooked i think this book is a must read for people struggling with ritual abuse,0
hardly worth reading this book while fairly well written was quite a dull story and was very depressing to read sherwood seems to have researched her subject well but the book seemed to be unnecessarily vulgar in a number of places and this made the book all the more unpleasant to read,0
statin levels based on what i have researched read each pill in this formula should contain NUMBER NUMBER mg oflovastatins icluding monacolins ka form the fda will not allow these companies to print this on the label they want everyone reliant on large pharma this formula was tested and contained no mycotoxin citrinin thought to cause chronic kidney disease in the balkans where this toxin is found in high levels a dosage of three pills a day should be a good start and is the minimum effective dosage shown to work in clinical trials i would also recommend taking a coq NUMBER supplement like q gel which is solubilized in polysorbate NUMBER for excellent absorption,1

excellent show poor sound unfortunatelly the dvd is dissapointing for tina fans the show is fantastic but both dolby digital and dts version of this dvd have one of the worst sounds i ever heard my subwoofer did not move once while the tweeters of the front speakers nearly went on flames more the soundtrack was re edited with sound taken from other concerts that incredible at one moment i swear that i heard the word munchen despite the fact that the concert is in amsterdam and oh yes the dvd is overpriced forget amsterdam and do not miss one last time in concert as it has verry good sound quality and image not speaking abut the phantastic show,0
northwinds god pan black widow northwinds seems to have a good share of originality to their sound it might be sort of tough to describe their work but i will try a french progressive outfit that blends old school sabbath with celtic music would that formula even fly it does here notice some truly inspired heavy guitar work along with some superb keyboard and flute playing on a total of six cuts with each one averaging eight minutes tunes i could not get enough of were the title track great god pan their sabbath cover of a national acrobat talk about covering an obscurity great work and the epic the forest of koncerei a real keeper,1
it does not use your classification for the musics i organize all my files into folders however this device ignores my classification and sort all files by artist and album there is no way to configure the device so i can browse my music through my folders moreover there is no easy way to create a playlist to do that you have to install the software that cames whith it and you can not add new musics to the playlist in another computer all playlists editions must be done in the same computer this is a huge limitation for me because i use a lot of different computers home office notebook i have not bought an ipod because it has the same limitations futhermore the software that comes with it is terrible much worst than itunes so if you organize your files into folder and would like to use this classification in your mp NUMBER player and if you do not want to buy an ipod because you will be tied on in a specific computer you should not buy this device,0
returned the view twice in one week i bought a sansa e NUMBER for myself and have not encountered any troubles so i decided to buy a view for my boyfriend right out of the box the player would not turn on because the power button was stuck we tried everything but nothing would happen the customer service people could not turn it on also so we exchanged that one the next one we received at least turned on we went home to charge it and then tried to start loading media on thats where trouble came for video and pictures you have to convert the file format by using the sansa downloadable converter i was able to transfer photos with no problem but we never were able to get video on the player we tried different files different computers and different people and nothing my boyfriend spoke to the customer representatives and had no luck i have transferred music video and photos to my sansa e NUMBER with no problems but this player has many problems,0
worst mp NUMBER player on the market i bought at the end of NUMBER and have been meaning to leave a review ever since but have not done so on account of not having anything nice to say about this product this is about the worst mp NUMBER player on the market sound quality is so so i can not create or save any playlists the worst aspect of this player is the battery life i charged it for one whole day and then when i disconnected it from the power source the battery bar immediately went to red please please do not waste your money time on this product i for one will never buy anythign that has the sandisk name on it,0
nice device this is a nice mp NUMBER i got it on black friday on amazon for only NUMBER NUMBER yes sansa view NUMBER gb mp NUMBER NUMBER while everyone else was looking at the lighting rounds on black friday they did not see the tiny small icons around the today deal page if you use a computer you should be able to tranfer sound images files without using a program it basic computer NUMBER i use sony sonicstage myself records at NUMBER for crisp sound,1
this player is very very good wow this has been one of the best products i bought with great sound great quality pictures in the video easy to load files into memory compatible with wmp it also brings a player sync in the installation cd i like i take all pareto i plug in the car sounds very hard is extremely friendly to navigate between playlists presntacion has several languages the spanish translation used is very good and relevant unlike others who say one thing and mean another i recommend,1
do not buy without a good return policy this player freezes constantly it possible not everyone has this issue also the menus can be a bit sluggish do not buy without a good return policy,0
do not buy this piece of crap i bought this piece of crap and found out it not compatible with tracks which are downloaded in drm digital rights management format which NUMBER out of NUMBER songs i downloaded from napster were in so i have basically a NUMBER radio worthless do not buy,0
nothing is from scratch why on earth would nothing is made from scratch be a selling point for a cookbook how horrid for good simple cooking look into mark bittman cookbooks,0
really funny and exciting i say this book is extremely informative for the responsible occasional sit at home drug user i read it and learned a few things about the law i did not know about definately a must read for anyone who uses any drugs whether it be a little or a lot if you are a dealer it gives you an outlook of legal information but one of the author commandments in the book is thou shall not sell which every dealer already knows the only rule for dealers is do not get caught,1
good book good story and interesting characters a lot of history in this story that i found to be interesting the life of indians has always fascinated me,1
great history i am a big fan of ms blake but this was not one of her better books it dragged a lot at times but the history involved in the story more than made up for it if you are a fan of people and their cultures you might want to give this book a try,1
handy card holders i play canasta and frequently wind up with gobs of cards which since i have small hands and am also a klutz i drop a lot and mix up the card holders are on the large size so they hold a lot of cards and have little props so they can stand alone they are also slightly curved to prevent other players from accidentally seeing your cards a very good deal for klutzes everywhere,1
it does the job if you can not hold the cards this will work but i believe they lost sight of their purpose and are trying to address a problem from outside the box the idea is to make it easier for the individual it can be difficult to get the cards in place and then change their positions defeating the fundamental purpose a block of wood will do better the card holder should not be a game within a game,0
buy this now very attractive solid and sturdy materials are very well organized not the cheapest but well worth it especially at the discount amazon provides and then there the content top notch stuff perfect,1
forward the mage an alternate style eric flint has become an established sf author however he has more than one style of writing this book is in an experimental style more related to rabelais cervantes voltaire swift and sterne this book set in joe world is the second book in this series although not main stream in any way it is an enjoyable book and well worth reading once read i was hooked into asking where is the rest of this story this is quite normal for this style of writing and i await eagerly the next volume,1
fantasy writing at its best eric flint and richard roach forward the mage is fantasy writing at its best an artist swordsman faces an evil sorcerer arrest and politics when his artistic ambitions are rerouted in a struggle for survival both feature fast paced action and complex believable settings,1
a device grows old related to the philosophical strangler stories overlap but this book focuses on gwendolyn benvenutti the sorcerer story of events in these characters lives before during and after phil strangler found the language a bit much to wade through a second time and not as funny if you loved philosophical strangler you will probably love this one but if you were growing weary by the end of the strangler you should probably pass this one up,0
cool documentary i was extremely excited to pop this dvd into my computer and watch it but please be aware this is more like a documentary and please do not let me deter you from buying this dvd a lot of interviews about the the world championship mixed with some great interludes of the interviewee riding watching them ride will inspire all of you mountain biking enthusiast out there as the description states this is about the riders and sacrifices they go through not about their riding skill and extreme stunts i expected non stop action but this is still a great dvd to add to my collection i have watched it a few times just to watch them ride their riding chapters a must buy for anyone serious about competitive dh racing shred it up all,1
informative but idiosyncratic coverage of historical warships this book offers an interesting diagrammatic presentation of thirty six warships ranging from a roman galley to a nimitz class aircraft carrier naval buffs will find this a useful book with numbered guides accompanying the cut away color diagrams that offered details about the layouts of the various ships yet the selection of what constitutes a great warship is rather idiosyncratic the selection is exclusively western in its orientation as chinese junks ottoman galleys or imperial japanese navy vessels completely absent moreover the compilers seemed to have been unable to decide whether a great warship was an innovative one or a historic one and included selections of both leaving out others more deserving in the process as a result while an interesting resource it is a limited one that lacks a theme that could have made it a truly valuable book,0
jabra eargels the service was good but the product did not have enough info for me to make a wise decision at the end i could not use the product on my jabra ear piece the item description should have information on compatible ear sets to help make a better purchasing choice,0
jabra ear gels these are not the same that come on the earbud and are not easy to use or to hear from i sent mine back,0
what a waste complete waste of NUMBER NUMBER if they stayed in your ear they might be worth something but good luck with that in ear earbuds work so much better than these,0
fast delivery great product super fast delivery the last ear loop on my jawbone had worn out the large ear gel fit over the jawbone earbud and with a little superglue stays there it fits in my ear without using any loops after a full day the ear is a little tender but it is getting better the more i use it i would highly recommend the ear gels for anyone with a jawbone improves sound and the fit of the sensor with the jaw,1
jabra ear gels save youself some money the jabra ear gels are an absolute waste they actually fit worse than the stock ear buds from jawbone i was even more disappointed that i paid NUMBER NUMBER shipping on a worthless NUMBER NUMBER product it not even worth returning lesson learned hopefully you will also,0
jabra eargels these really do make wearing a jawbone a lot better for me the only problem i found with them is that you have to buy so many just to get the one that fits right,1
do not waste your money they look cheep and feel cheep and well they are cheep but they do not work which is the bottom line fitting them onto the jawbone does not lock into place so the ear piece you just spent over a NUMBER bucks for falls out of your ear it not worth it since jawbone gives you five ear buds that lock onto the jawbone which fit your snugly in your ear they also give you a left ear or a right ear bar that lets you choose which works for you so this product fails and had i seen them in person i would not have spent my money on them,0
not well suited for the jawbone ii when i first installed one of these on my new jawbone ii they were fantastic they fit my ear canal perfectly negating the need for the ear loop that came with it unfotunately after a few days they started rejecting my headset the ear pieces would not stay on the jawbone and they would no longer stay firmly in my ear i tried washing and drying them thoroughly but that only helped for an hour or so i am not sure what the fit problem is but they turned out to not work for my jawbone ii and me at all,0
pain in the ear they feel better than the jawbone junk but there is no perfect fit even though they give you several different sizes then the jawbone bluetooth falls out of most of them basically a waste of money unless you are one of the lucky ones that all fits as you had hoped,0
jeg the product arrived as expected the ear gels fit the jawbone well and were perfect for ill perfect ears,1
scottiesgems i bought this to see if using the gels would help keep my jawbone in place none of the gels fit in my ear,0
do not waste your money after ordering these eargels i spent an enormous amount of time trying to make them fit it was useless unless you have elephant ears or you wish to grease them and use a hammer to insert them they will not work,0
this movie is not all that originally i would give this horrible dipiction of the odyssey NUMBER star but because of one of the last scenes where ugly t telemachus threw two spears at once i give it two stars everything was horrible to my opinion the accents kept changing everything if you read the book before you watched the movie you would thinkt hat this was all a joke so if anything just read the book by itself so two stars for two stars thrown by ugly t,0
hmmmmmmm i have seen better movies on the all news channel odysseus was played very well but his part was boring as well as the rest of the movie scylla looks like NUMBER cartoons i drew better stuff in NUMBER st grade every single scene looks so fake it is not even funny i can probably get more entertainment watching an earthworm i would not recommend this to anyone young or old this movie is not worth a penny in my book,0
crap all crap you would have noticed how horrible the allusions are in this crap that calls itself a movie the characters were simply annoying telemakhos the whiny school boy that cries whenever he does not get his way creepy athena who eyes are supposed to be gray penelope who obviously has a more pleasureful time on the water on the beach than with her husband and of course odysseus who would make me weep if he was my captain the sets looked as if elementary school kids put them together scylla was a sock puppet and the shades were just sad i have never in my life seen such crap and i hope you will not fall for these other NUMBER star reviews that make me want to puke,0
the odyssey with armand asanti i really like this version especially since there is really very few versions of this work of literature,1
great movie but what with the price i have seen this movie before and was looking to buy it to show in my classroom but why the heck is it NUMBER it good but not that good,0
very boring this movie was very boaring i really did not enjoy it at all it was to gory i just do not enjoy when people kill i also do not enjoy when people dress like old stone age and do not enjoy the anceint times they were rough and crewl times the movie the odyssey took place in greece back thousands of years ago when there was such things as mythical creatures i really do not enjoy things like that others might although there is a part i did like i enjoyed the part of the movie when calypso venessa williams kept odysseus on the island for two years she nor her maids had not seen a man for NUMBER years i thought that was very interesting the other parts of the muvie confuse me and the names confuse me such as penelope greta scacchi athene isabella rossellini cyclopes reid asato and eurybates ron cook those were just a few so all in all i would give this movie one star i f you like movies like this then its great and go watch it but if you do not its not a movie for you as you can see,0
birds beasts and relatives as always gerard durrell works make me want to hop on a flight to greece right now his imagery of the lush flora and fauna there make it seem irresistible to anyone especially small boys though it was an enjoyable read it seemed a bit too similar to my family and other animals as though this sequel was everything he had forgotten to put into the first one which is exactly what the author states in the introduction this book seemed to focus a bit more on the animals less on the comical family and though sea life is fascination crustaceans do get a bit old this book is very relaxing to read and almost makes you feel like you are a little boy again slow paced and funny this enjoyable book put corfu at the top of my list of places to go,1
i do not think so quite often bringing a classic story like moby dick to the screen is a thankless task but at least john huston NUMBER version has a lot of class as well any number of great performances even moby dick looked a lot more realistic in NUMBER this version just does not make it skip it and buy a copy of gregory peck rendition instead you will be glad you did,0
the white whale is not the annimation for the white whale was lousy the original with g peck is a classic you can not do a remake to match it the attempt to give underwater scenes with the white whale sending the ship to the bottom stunk,0
did not fit in ear i was amazed how poorly these fit in my ear in fact after trying for a couple of weeks i could not tell which one was the r and which was the l as they both fit so poorly the spiky part hurt my ear after a few minutes of wearing i threw these out and purchased the umbo earbud much much better fit there,0
great series opener i picked up this book used for a couple dollars while on vacation and spent the rest of my vacation reading it i rated this book NUMBER stars because even though i found it to be very enjoyable i seemed to easily figure out where the plot was heading nevertheless i was still surprised by the ending i found the tension between hester and monk to be both intriguing and frustrating especially when it was not resolved at the end of the book needless to say i was delighted to discover that there are NUMBER soon to be NUMBER more books in the series i plan to read them all,1
the face of a stranger since i started somewhere in the middle of the series this book was the explanation of who monk was and about his accident in which he lost his memory this is a wonderful series and i would recommend it to anyone and suggest beginning with this book the face of a stranger which is the first in the series for a more complete appreciation of each following book,1
waste of time and money i have used this product in addition to the fogger and carpet powder i have sprayed all furniture bedding hard to reach spaces etc and a month later i still have fleas it is a major waste of time and money,0
this is not a normal mercedes lackey book when i read a mercedes lackey book i expect to care about what happens to someone in the book there was no one here who was enough to care about the people all felt like shadows without true substance or reasons to their actions i could not find reasons to cheer for anyone one problem is there were too many people to follow easily since there were so many none of them were drawn richly enough to draw me into their world,0
i hope frances mayes got a lot of money for the rights i love her books so much this movie is an absolute insult the original story was so wonderful i can not understand why the film makers thought they were making something better and ed what about ed geez i could only get through the part where they were taking out the wall between the two rooms foolishly thinking that the movie would get better and after that i was done another good thing about dvds is that you do not have to be kind and rewind it would have be a waste of electricity and my vcr this movie is right up there with ishtar except worse,0
very much disappointed it was just terrible for me living in italy for many years now i hated to see exaggerated stereotyping of italian men it seemed to me a real bad hollywood interpretation of a room with a view,0
a very sexy and entertaining film NUMBER stars a very sexy and entertaining film sure this film is heartwarming and inspiring it is also funny and pleasant but it is also sexy very sexy infact and it is very enjoyable and entertaining NUMBER stars,1
terrible movie i rented this movie with the highest of expectations due to the things i had heard talked about it like that it was funny and romantic and had wonderful scenery what a disappointing story the story had no sense of direction it seemed badly glued together as if the scriptwriters were saying we will make her a divorced woman and then we will make her go on a gay tour and oh wait let us make her have no morals and have sex with a man she has not known for even one day and lets make her flirt with the real estate man all in all the story turned out to be pretty stupid with nothing to admire in the main character,0
last time i let the blockbuster guy recommend a movie what a waste of two hours as a romantic comedy it falls short on both romance and comdey as a movie trying to give over a lesson it is trite overdone and poorly performed the writing is unimpressive the story is dull and far fetched and many details either make no sense or detract from the overall plot what was the point they seemed to have forgotten to find one,0
under the tuscany sun was very very disappointed movie though brand new just out of the box it was stopping all the time during the latter part of the movie,0
wonderfully inspiring movie in this movie as with life usually our plans from our beginnings do not work out like we think they will if yours have and you are one of the those living your dreams twenty fifty etc years later i am sure you are counting your blessings frances new story begins when she acts on instinct instead of planning and thus life begins rather unexpectedly to frances to have its own design for her life she has her hopes and dreams for what her life will become little does she know she will get exactly what she asks for however as in true life it may not be in the way you expect it a truly inspirational movie for anyone struggling through some tough times in your life i can not tell you how many times i have seen it but i probably could not use my fingers to count even if i counted each of them twice also must mention diane lane sandra oh you guys are the best,1
diane lane is great but skip this movie diane lane is the only redeemable part to this lame effort the film takes tremendous liberties with the plot from the book way way too much pc madness a waste of time and money,0
canon nb NUMBER l good for the xs NUMBER is i think it always best to get the actual canon battery rather than a replacement substitute the battery life so far is pretty good at least NUMBER hours,1
here what really happened the john houseman character from the excellent james caan original version jumped into a time machine with the intent of destroying the social commentary critical to multinational monopolies from the first film and spreading cultural plastics so prevalent in his future history the result is dumbed down junk where you must give up the idea of wondering how movie executive decisions are made i think he did a good job,0
a failure of battlefield earth proportions i should say worse than battlefield earth proportions this whole movie makes you just sit there at the end and go why everything about this convoluted sarcastic beefed up badly edited tripe is confusing to watch poorly executed and loses you NUMBER minutes into the film you are introduced to boring characters cliched camera angles and material we all know john mcteirnan is far more capable of i was thankful i got to rent this instead of buying it because quite frankly this movie just plain stinks if you really want to see the real rollerball rent do not buy the original the original has a much stronger story and for cryin out loud james caan he a legend man i do not know what kind of future chris klein has in movies but as far as action movies go let us just put it this way we already have keanu reeves and quite bluntly he a much better actor steer clear and save your money,0
terrible movie do not buy this movie was one of the worst films i have seen in years the script is horrible the movie had little glitches on it and a big scene of the movie is shot in night vision green if you are thinking of buying this movie read this review i give this movie NUMBER stars but the minimum is NUMBER star,0
horrible i had high hopes for this movie i actually thought it would be at least a little bit decent it was not it was pure garbage i had to leave this movie after the first NUMBER minutes its that bad avoid this movie at all costs,0
zero stars omg i can not believe i even bothered to finish this thing i wish i had read the reviews as it is i distroyed the copy of the tape i had so that will not inflict damage on anyone else in an evironmentally friendly way of course the original roller ball was pretty bad and the remake is worse if that were possible in a fit of weakness i put the tape in the machine and let it play i kept thinking this can not get any worse and then it did repeat and then thank god it was over if i could sue for the return of my NUMBER hrs of veiwing time i would,0
junk need i say more junk this movie should have never been made there is basically no story present and is just a bunch of people going around on rollerblades bashing each other brains in i was really looking foreword to this flick it previews were misleading it looked as though it was brilliant and exciting guess what it really really really not trust me do not waste your time unless the only thing better you have to do is give the cat a bath even then i really do not believe you should waste your time,0
i hope i am not allergic to it i ordered this based on the reviews i ordered on NUMBER NUMBER and received it on NUMBER NUMBER i needed it by NUMBER NUMBER i love the musky smell i only tested NUMBER drop on my wrist i have to say that after a couple of hours the smell turned into a strong sex smell not bad but definitely sex i am going to test it out at work next week but the real test is on NUMBER NUMBER i will report my findings then NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER it works this is definitely going to be my go to scent it drove my man crazy i love it i will purchase again,1
concisely written this book has been a great help to us as we work with our russian guests we are never going to be fluent in russian but this little handbook makes communication possible thank you,1
what the it is jut an action figure you build and then you let it sit on the floor for months until it is stepped on what will this do for you all it does is make noises have you looked at the price of the item and do you think it is a good price for something that does nothing but make a noise and just sits there after one day of being played with this has no education value for yu gi oh fans you should try buying yu gi oh tins instead of this crap,0
when good products go bad i bought two of the NUMBER two years ago and actually fell in love with the machine despite the tv guide debacle blame cable companies on that not the manufacturers after a year and a half the first one stopped working best i can tell the hard drive just failed the cost for fixing makes it smarter to buy a new one so i trashed it a few months later the second one stopped working altogether also i absolutely love the machine but there is obviously some problme with the hard drives i am waiting until pioneer replaces this line NUMBER NUMBER to buy a better one do not know why there is so little to choose from in the industry for this type of product,0
very disappointed although these sheets are pretty and warm their size and fit are horrible the fitted bottom sheet is far too long plus the elastic around the corners is not tight enough to keep the sheet on the mattress which tends to come off through the night and the flat sheet is barely wide enough i would not buy these again,0
very large these run very large and do not fit correctly because of this however for the price i still think they are a great bargain they are very heavy duty and will probably last many years they are also very warm almost too warm here in southen california those people in cold climates would love them anyhow i would be giving five stars except for the mismatched fit but i just tucked it in really good and they stay on the bed just fine,1
do not get it do not get it the graphics suck and u can only get mega man u should wait to get the progress pet or the double soul pet,0
not a good toy this toy is not well made or designed with kids in mind you have to shake it forever before it will even do anything i thought it was broken at first but then i found out that you can shake it for NUMBER min and nothing will happen but that normal if you like megaman then i get the gba game instead of the pet toy,0
jbl mrx NUMBER m jbl has several price points for it professional sound reinforcement products jrx is the least expensive and mrx is the second least expensive the mrx series offer higher quality and durability for a very reasonable price these are normally NUMBER NUMBER each amazon offered a new opened package which i was able to purchase for much less these are extremely lightweight for the amount of power they can handle power handling is between NUMBER and NUMBER watts depending on the program nominal wattage is NUMBER watts into NUMBER ohms excellent for live monitoring or as mains for smaller venues speakon in and out connectors only non protruding handle great product,1
good for downhill only i can not believe this rates higher than NUMBER stars do not be fooled this only good for down hill while it is well built you can not propel this trike as advertized save your money do not buy this,0
pratchetts best since i am a literature student i am a reads everything i can get person having once recognized pratchetts works i left all my classic german literature aside and started reading and reading and reading but this book small gods has beaten everything i have read before even my all time favorite faust you know the goethe one it is witty intelligent and above all deaply questioning i remained nodding all the time yes that what i always believed religion is about,1
pratchett review haiku i have been trying to distill my reviews to seventeen syllables here an attempt a tortoise falls fromthe sky brutha must showthe heretics truth,1
why do people like this garbage okay i had to read this book for a fantasy lit class i am taking my teacher and all of my fellow classmates it seems find it hilarious i however am left wondering why i understand what he getting at with religion and what not i have just seen it done in a much better way by much better authors the characters are boring and flat his humor is downright stupid this book is not clever in the least if you do not know the things he pointing out in a way which suggests he thinks they are quite witty you really need to think for yourself i guess it might appeal to the great masses who can find nothing better to do with their time than go to the next big blockbuster movie and buy the latest crap novel but then the back of the book does say he is a popular author and like most things that are popular it must be accessible to the public or else they will not understand,0
boring plot i liked what it was about the characters and alot of the ideas what i did not like was the plot it just bored me the only reason i kept reading was to see if it had anymore ideas in it i love his ideas especially in books like mort colour of magic and light fantastic,0
cross contamination the many ideas given eat the inside of sandwiches eat the top off of canapes avoid the crust can give a true celiac serious consequences sometimes a person can eat gluten with no obvious side effects but do great silent damage to one intestines there are complications to celiac disease such as refractory sprue and collagenous sprue i have these complications due to not being strict enough when following the gluten free diet,0
just accepting gluten free life i have read the other reviews of this book and while i appreciate everyone opinions i must say that this book helped me immensely i am new to the gluten free life i have been ill for two years and am just finding out that gluten is one of my issues i had no prior knowledge and this book did a lot to allay my fears i have not read against the grain so i can not compare the two jax made me laugh often even through my tears i recommend it for those just starting out,1
terrible my sister was recently diagnosed with celiac disease and there is a strong chance that i may have it as well i wanted to read about it to learn more and was told that this book was a great place to start unfortunately i found the book to be poorly written and with the most bizarre suggestions how to write your family a christmas letter informing them of the diagnosis come on there are other instances that i felt it was just a little over the top and was not realistic to everyday life since finishing this book i began reading elizabeth hasselbeck book the g free diet and have found it to be much more informative and much better written ms hasselbeck book gets right to the point giving you the information that you really need to understand this disease,0
get the facts most of the people who gave shining sparkly reviews of this book focus on how it made them feel it is not boring jax is a talented writer i will give her that but when i read on page NUMBER that the perscription drugs i was on and had been on for NUMBER years both pfizer drugs were not gf i was seriously troubled many follow ups with both pfizer and online support groups have indicated just how full of erroneous information this book is i went off my meds immediately thinking i was injesting gluten i suffered the undue consequences of going off cold turkey when i needed to taper off in actuality those meds are gf and always were if you want the facts as boring as they are do not rely on this book if you want some comfort and laughs then give it a read but be sure to take any factual information with a grain of salt as they say jax was indeed very lax when writing this book,0
thank god for jax peters lowell what a wonderful easy book to read and so helpful so many books and articles on this subject are just too plain technical and boring to read not the gluten free bible it is clear easy to understand and very engaging i really appreciate how the author relates the issues of living gluten free to everyday life it is an intelligent book that is fun to read and very very informative at the same time i have never written a book review before but i am so impressed with the gluten free bible that i want to share these thoughts with everyone and i intend to rush out to buy the other books by this insightful witty writer enjoy to your health,1
not useful and a waste of money the software does not cocur to the current usmle pattern it is a waste of money the questions present on the trial cd are misleading they do not reflect the pattern of questions inside do not waste your money on this,0
devoid of depth or even much substance the only type of person to whom i could possibly recommend this book is someone with no experience with children and who wants a forest level view of them from one source there is nothing in this book for a parent in the thick of childrearing although they are completely out of date with respect to political correctness and product availability the series from the gesell institute your one year old your two year old etc etc provides immensely better insight into what is going on with children at particular ages and stages raising your spirited child is a much better place to start looking for advice getting along with a difficult child or even an average difficulty child i am saddened and more than a bit annoyed i purchased the book on the basis of the organization recommendation that the american academy of child adolescent psychiatry would put its imprimatur on a book containing such little insight,0
try something else i picked up this book at b n because i had just read two jane austin novels and i thought this would be a light read i was wrong the beggining and the end had a purpose in the story but the middle could have been much much shorter and the ending made a little longer i liked the character of mr bounderby he was very well developed i would even say over developed but he was the only one how did sissy influence the youngest gradgrind why did not we know of mrs bounderbys inner turmoil till she ran to her father every character had something missing what happened to mr bounderby once he was found out why is sissy so special and what did she really do for the family it was a long book where nothing much happened until the last quarter and when it finally ended i felt cheated because it lacked a complete story line and full characters the story line could have been forgiven if i was more satisfied with the characters,0

politics a rather disappointing read since the book fails to adequately deal with the politics of the period house argument that oppositional painting is necessarily political is not only flawed but little evidence is offered in support of his argument an argument which goes something like this many impressionist works and also those by manet explicitly reject preordained hierachies of value in terms of both legibility of subject matter and technique they are thus subversive disruptive and oppositional and as a result political i had expected the book to address in a more explicit detailed and concrete manner the relationship of art produced at the time to politics however many of the descriptions of the works themselves are enlightening and chapter NUMBER viewer of modern life is well worth a read,0
a must for handgunners old and new this is a great reference for anyone considering using handguns as self defense even experienced people should have a book like this as a refresher and reference is it perfect no such a short book is only so comphrensive but it manages to impart a lot of knowledge nonetheless and anyone who thinks they know a lot about guns should study the experts see alsothe seven myths of gun control reclaiming the truth about guns crime and the second amendment,1
lousy camera this is the first time i post a review because i am compelled to do so i bought this camera to use during the christmas holidays i tried to use it the first time to take a picture of the christmas tree all i saw was complete darkness then i realized that i needed more light so i turned on all the lights in the house and it was still darkness if you plan to use this camera indoor please forget about it no way it is not that great outdoor neither i took many pictures with the automatic exposure setting it can not handle anything with a bright background it will just be very bright i tried to use it on the ski slopes i think it is because of the cold temperature the camera has to be reset often to make the matter worse the pictures turned out literally twisted i can not belive a hp camera can have so many flaws very disappointing please do not buy one,0
piece of junk camera is only usable outside in broad daylight trying anything inside your home place of business and you will have nothing but black on your screen i am returning the product and will probably try lifeview camera with flash to see if camera aperture allows more light in i was in rooms that were pretty well lit up and viewfinder is dark as night should never have been released as a product because of these flaws and it does not have to be this way laptop usb cameras offer incredibly bright pictures in low light conditions,0
video too i was very impressed with it it take stills and movie clips great and it so small great pocket p c add on,1
motown heaven the soundtrack for boomers this NUMBER cd album is a wonerful collection of the best of motown in which the holland dozier holland tagline under the title of the record meant high quality r b and almost always resulted in a mega hit the collection begins with the very earliest hit eddie holland singing jamie and proceeds through most of the major early hits of the miracles the supremes martha and the vandellas mary wells the marvalettes the NUMBER tops the isley brothers and more this cd replaces my old collection of NUMBER rpm recordings and has allowed me to enjoy the motown sound without haaving a huge number of cd to collect the one downside about this wonderful collection is that the NUMBER rd cd contains mostly less well known tunes with the exceeption of two diana ross supremes cuts my world is empty without you and forever came today in all the collection is a terrific value and brings back fond memories the soundtrack to my teenage years rock on,1
great true crime read i really have to give this author credit as far as being able to be so objective in writing about her cousin killers and the police detectives who forced a confession from her innocent brother the book presents its facts on the case leaving us to our own conclusions what is so ironic about the case is that the cousins were going to the old chain of rocks bridge to read an anti racism poem written by one of the victims only to be brutally murdered by a gang of the minorities that she was probably referring to a very fast and good read,1
static central audio playback through this extension is terrible constant static i have used it with multiple sources and playback devices speakers and headphones and all have the same result static replaced it with a higher quality cable and the problem was solved not worth the hassle of trying to get a replacement when the cable only cost NUMBER shipped to begin with,0
i expected something better edit i updated this review in response to comments and changes in the product description when i purchased the cable the product photo showed gold plated connectors and existing reviews jose lima NUMBER larkenfield NUMBER mentioned separately insulated wires and gold plated connectors so that what i originally thought i was going to get the cable i received had nickel plated connectors it did not have separately insulated wires it worked but the sound started cutting out after less than a month and i have long since thrown the cable away given at least one other reviewer of this product joseph z singer NUMBER did not get what they expected based on the product description i think it safe to say that the product photo and the descriptions of the product in all but the most recent reviews is unreliable if i were you i buy from another shipper,0

freud is crazy i have studied philosophy to a good degree and therefore and to read some of freud work in philosophy of psychology while making some entertaining remarks freud has now long been discounted as anything valid and understandably so,0
if life is a dream then do not wake me up this book is a watershed in human intellectual history in it freud undermines the picture of mankind as primarily a being of reason and presents the idea that we are all creatures of our wishes our inner unconscious lives dreams are not nothing and they are not in freud eyes rare religious gifts but rather to the key to our own mental life freud in this book presents a vast world of examples and interpretations i am not a psychologist and do not consider myself competent to really judge how much of what freud presents here is valid or even capable of scientific testing i do know that this work is one which like a great literary masterpiece has inspired countless interpretations and reinterpretations understanding human intellectual history is now impossible without knowing this work,1
it arriived ordered it it arrived quickly it is used and is as described i will update whenever i read it d,1
barely unbeatable theory freud the interpretation of dreams is a unique book his treatise on human dreams is truly a product of a brilliant mind but neither the process of creation itself nor not the results and findings it brought out are the true wonders of this book the great achievement of freud theory is its immunity to criticism in other words it is virtually impossible to criticize the results and propositions inserted in this book his main tenet a dream is a fulfillment of a desire can not be attacked in any intelligible way if one says for instance that an unpleasant dream or a bloody nightmare is clearly not the fulfillment of a desire freud would promptly mention masochism or self punishment or if one finally brings forth a dream that is surely not a desire fulfilled he might nonetheless say there is at least a desire accomplished viz the desire to destroy freud dream theory,1

one of the best of the marco polo josef strauss series this is one of the best of marco polo s josef strauss edition mika eichenholf allows to quick polkas to gallop fleetly the march has plenty of swagger the polkas mazur have poise and there is a lilt and a joy in the waltzes that make you welcome rather than dread the many repeats josef strauss often succeeded in creating dances in the minor key but there are none of them here what is here is his last composition the hesperus bahnen waltz published as op NUMBER after the forty three year old composer s death,1

sure she a little annoying but yes by reading every review we all know by now that sheri is a wee bit annoying and her participants are an interesting sort of people and yes it did put my husband in a coma like trance everytime we watched it but everything in this dvd is so valuable i learned everything i needed to know through this dvd without taking more time off work to go to classes and since it was always available to me by the touch of a button i was able to review the important things while i was acually in labor i had to kill time waiting for my contractions to be NUMBER mins apart before we went to the hospital so i popped in the dvd and trust me my husband was no longer in a trance he was taking notes this was my first child and thanks to sheri my labor was only NUMBER hour and i only pushed for NUMBER mins NUMBER good ones and he was out i think doing what sheri says and waiting till your dialated NUMBER cm before you get an epideral was really key,1
great information my husband and i got more out of this than the free classes the hospital nurses give we have been able to watch it over for things we missed there is tons of useful information too much to take in at once i love having it becasue if i forget something i just re watch that section its helped us become familar with the terms the nurses use and we have great information for question asking when we go to our dr apts,1
good overview and very informative i really enjoyed this dvd it provided good content at a nice pace i highly recommend this dvd,1
superb when i was NUMBER months pregnant i am desperate to take child birth class in order to help me have normal delivery i searched over the net the best detailed class voila i came accross this product on one of my searches i never had second thoughts of ordering this product i regularly viewed and applied all the techniques taught on dvd it really works i had an easy labor plus i had normal delivery superb i recommend this dvd for those who wanted a modern and comprehensive child birth class margery bermejo davao city philippines,1
chilbirth education video great videos i am a former labor and delivery nurse the videos were purchased for my daughter who is expecting her first child this summer the videos were extrememly ionformative and great fun to watch they helped my daughter prepare for her first labor and delivery experience they also helped review and update me on current l and d practices thanks for a wonderful product,1
th e most annoying woman on earth i am sure this woman has lots of valuable info to impart but we could barely watch this dvd sheri bayles is sooo annoying and unfunny that we fast forwarded through the whole thing trying to cling on to pieces of important information even the people taking the class seem embarassed for her avoid this dvd unless you think you can look past a nurse who thinks she a stand up comedian i wish i had another to suggest,0
go for it this tape is simply fun and informative i am not even pregnant or expecting to have to conceive anytime soon but i had to watch this i am a woman why not the lady is so corky and yet serious enough to have you practically writing notes like your in a college i would recommend this video to anyone interested in really learning about childbirth she explains everything how your body should be functioning what is stretching what liquids to look for as signs of this and that charts of how the baby is actually sitting and how exactly it growing and she even quizzes the husbands there is so much to learn open a bag of kettle corn and grab a pillow though it like four or five hours long phew but it probably would not be best to watch it all in one sitting anyway it is a lot of information to grasp enjoy,1
loved this video after i bought this dvd i watched it about NUMBER times on my own and with my husband before our son was born we both laughed at sheri mannerisms but really loved all we learned from her we both felt more prepared even though we were not able to attend birthing classes,1
recommend i was going for a med free birth not for any reason other than i wanted to because my mom did it with my sisters and i and i figured i could do it as well it what our bodies are meant to do right well this dvd was great it saved me from paying over NUMBER for a lamaze class and i felt the stuff she touched on for the lamaze section was perfect i did not have a doula or a midwife just my husband an awesome nurse and this dvd i enjoyed being able to watch it in the comfort of my own home and go back to certain parts to rewatch it a bit outdated and cheesy but overall very honest and good worked for me if anything its worht the few for reference after a birthing class i am giving NUMBER stars instead of NUMBER b c they should really look into updating it soon,1
could not finish watching thank goodness i borrowed this from the public library and did not waste my money my husband and i did attend live classes but wanted a refresher before the big event while the information is consistent with what we have learned from other professionals the presenter is terribly annoying although we wanted the information the jokes were so unbearable we had to stop watching if you can deal with the presenter sense of humor you will benefit from the information good luck,0
very informative laugh and learn about childbirthexcellent information and humorous all at the same time,1
poignant intelligent give this one a listen ron playful and probing musicality emerges in this album with the no holds barred clairvoyance i came to expect after he wrote and performed two film scores for me i find him to be a certifiable bonafide talent one of life genuine little treasures secreted away in the mountains of montana in a way i am selfishly sorry to hear his album is realizing such widespread success i was kind of hoping to keep him all to myself,1
exquisitely fresh jazzy melodius crisp classy mysterious jazz that rolls into the imaginary worlds of a native american dance a smokey nashville nightclub a cruise with the whales hints of paul consort with a crisp and haunting classical foundation a journey through the NUMBER th century and back again into the lonely montana night where ron strolls with star gazing abandon,1

one of my favorites with two of my favorite actors mark harmon and the lovely madeline stowe i caught this on cable back in the early NUMBER i had a big crush on madeline stowe since seeing her in revenge so i decided to check this out and i was not disappointed definitely not a general classic but i love this film with less capable and less likeable actors this film would this is one of those rare cases where the actors elevate the material this is one of those rainy day got nothing else to do movies it definitely worth a look and the amazon price is definitely right give it a shot i do not think you will be disappointed,1

daniel auteuil is fabulous i have been a fan of daniel auteuil for some time and look forward to each new movie this one is very funny and entertaining,1
this book is aweful i read this book NUMBER years ago it still makes me highly agitated every time i think about it you just feel bad for the main character through most of the book and there is no redemption at the end it has the worst ending ever it still pisses me off that i spent the time reading it there is not really much of a story just a lot of details and weird issues there are too many tangents and the protagonist is the only character with any sort of common sense aside do not read if you are sensitive to rape that should be on the back cover or in a disclaimer somewhere not recommended,0
captivating and engrossing when i first picked up this book some NUMBER years ago i was initially put off by the thickness of it but once i started reading i was totally hooked the strong self assured and intellegent female character was truely refreshing i have given this book to my sisters and to several friends and whenever i get into a discussion about books this is one of the books i bring up and strongly encourage every i know to read today i have come to shop for this book so that i might send it to a pen pal in west africa he wants me to send him books that will assist him in speaking better english and this was the first book i thouht to send him well that and a dictionary thanks to jean auel for writing such a great novel,1

one of the best series ever when my dad first gave me this book to read it had the orignal cover and was sort of deteriorating and i had a feeling that i woudl not really like it that was definitely not what happened ayla is a very inspirational character and it hard to put the book down once you start it unfortunetaly i was on vacation when i started it so i had to stop reading but i would have read it in a day i quickly bought the other books in the series and read each one better than the next although the clan of the cave bear was ultimatly the best one i recommend the series to someone over the age of NUMBER it would be hard to follow if you were younger and some parts are inappropriate especially in the following books this was one of my favorite books and be warned once you start its so hard to stop,1
giants mats the blue portion of the mats was a different blue it looked more like a navy blue which i found very disappointing because that like having a pair of bootleg mats,0
exactly what i ordered product arrived on time in great condition as usual amazon provided a vehicle to acquire a product that i wanted,1
touching beautiful film excellent acting the story transports you to other worlds to experience the full gamut of emotions these are real people with real issues another example of life being stranger than fiction as portrayed in a film hope there a part ii,1
one of the best foreign language films for once a film coming from a north european country that is neither unhealthy nor perverse suzanne bier is a wonderful director as she proved in two of my favorite films things we lost in the fire and brothers,1
wonderfully emotional great story line the pacing of the plot was well thought out sometimes rather predictable but the actors really brought a sense of honesty,1
the remix is different i own this album in the original vinyl and a earlier cd release i am always a sucker for a remaster so decided what the heck i chose poorly the remixes just do not sound right for all i know this NUMBER version was the original intent i hope not,0
why the remix if a music company wants to remix an old album they should put it on a second disc like pearl jam did with their recent re release of NUMBER not replace the original album mix like mushroom is doing here this new remix is not as good as the original versions of these songs wish they would remaster the original mix and issue it,0
art and passion but no science a series of short vignettes about fencing none detailed enough to impart and real knowledge a definite lack of technical instruction on fencing not sure who this video would be useful for certainly not a beginner trying to learn about the technical aspects of the sport,0
no illustrations the kindle version has no illustrations and the formatting makes it hard to read and enjoy the verses the limericks appear without logical line shifts and where the illustration is supposed to be it just says illustration which is a lot more annoying than not having anything there at all it free but it hard to read and that kind of takes the fun out of it at least for me,0
no drawings i love love loved edward lear but unfortunately this free copy does not have the marvelous drawings it would be better to get another edition of this wonderful book one that is illustrated,0

old school bore metal this album offers nothing new or exciting to the genre of metal this is reminiscent of mediocre late NUMBER trash metal with all songs sounding the same mid paced tempos and simplistic solos abound with moronic wayyyyy out of date pretend satanic lyrics and cartoony cover art just dumb dumb dumb want real thrash metal aside from the big four try coroner arch enemy arsis the crown the haunted hypocrisy and a ton of others that poop all over this album from miles above,0
only works with microsoft e mail clients if you are security minded and choose to use an e mail client like thunderbird or the bundled opera e mail client this program will not protect you not only that but the fact that ca anti virus will only work with ms outlook or outlook express is not revealed in any documentation i found this out the hard way when a manual scan found a virus in my opera mail folder and could not clean or quarantine it the ca tech confirmed that the av program only works with ms e mail clients to me this is false advertising,0
a new beginning this was their first true recording project although it was thier second full album i give this album four stars because though i love this album and this band five stars would mean it an album that stands next to physical graffitti the white album and a select few other records this album is a must own for fans who enjoy any of the splinter disciplines of what sabbath hendrix and zeppelin started an album worth the money with many great songs and performances if there are any criticisms one would be the production it leaves some room for improvement beyond that i hope this band can continue to build upon this awesome release for years to come purchas and enjoy,1

a jesse stuart harvest my opinion of it a jesse stuart harvest is a collection of stories by jesse stuart all the stories bring out his personality and the talking of the old west this book also has an introduction that narrates the life of the author jesse stuart i think this book is really good because it takes you on a trip through time and into a world of adventure my favorite story was snake teeth because it has a lot of cliffhangers and adventure i would recommend this book for NUMBER yrs adults because normally after NUMBER years of age you will understand the dialect in this book,1
flyboys here is another example of hollywood going wrong the history that is implicated in the events portrayed in this movie is not all that tough to get right nevertheless the film makers got a few details correct but then added improbable special effects far too many triplanes annoying social lesson stereotypes and a host of ridiculous story twists and time wasting baggage conceptually the movie should have been a winner in execution it is a disappointment they ruined a potentially good story instead of buying this movie i would suggest the blue max as the aerial scenes are far better or just propose that the would be viewer read a history book as a parting comment however i always have liked jean reno he is the good part of this film,0
world war i aviation visited i have enjoyed watching flyboys several times the special effects are outstanding and very lifelike one of the features that i really enjoyed was watching the bonus features at the end i noticed that one of the people interviewed was from colorado and as a result i went to his museum and checked out versions of some of the planes represented in the movie i find the investment in time and money for this feature was well worth it,1
fly boys i have not watched this movie it was purchased for a christmas present i heard about this movie on american family radio and they gave it wonderfuly reviews my brother is ex military and loves these types of movie since afr gave them a wonderful review i thought this would be something that he would enjoy,1

thank god i thank god for the writer of this book this book explains new insight on jesus parables taking in consideration of the lord geographical location and culture it took me a while to read this book why because this is the type of book that you may want to meditate after reading it its not something that you read and let bygones be bygons this book particularly focuses on what our actions should be as jesus followers it addresses issues like greed or me society that we often ignore i like to stress out that jesus pointed everything plainly for us this book only reminds us to go back and look deeper within ourselves and question if god is really what motivates us in everything we do i love this book and will give it to friends i know please pray for me so i can share it to others as well and also put the jesus words into action thank god,1
getting tired of the cliche just another one of those movies a bunch of young kids travelling somewhere and get cut up into pieces because some psycho wants their organs neither scary nor educational tommy you are taking anatomy NUMBER and believe me this movie does not help you pass that class many scenes are too dark to tell what happened hear someone scream and some light streakes across the screen and the next thing you know someone has dropped it is okay to see it for free but not worth it when you pay for the ticket,0
shameful ripoff even in the hour plus up charactor developement i guess talky anti american movies is the latest trend i was watching the talky trailer on my computer and got sleepy,0
great movie horrible dvd buena vista the company that releases disney films on dvd chose to not release anamorphic dvds when they first came to dvd so none of these films are anamorphically enhanced this means if you have a widescreen television you will have black bars on all four sides of the picture also these discs are absolutely barebones only featuring a dolby NUMBER NUMBER soundtrack and a NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER widescreen presentation where are the extras i do not know about you guys but i am a mighty duck fan who is disappointed by the dvd release of this film,0

mighty ducks rulz this is a fun movie for children my sons watched this too many times when they were NUMBER years old and i am convinced this had a significant impact on them learning to love the game of hockey i know that sounds corny but it is true my oldest is now playing hockey in college and my younger son is playing in high school club good clean movie i bought these two copies for two friends of mine who have younger sons interested in the game hopefully it will impact them like it did ours go ducks,1
what this when i first heard his single one wish i thought this is a good tune but then he got to the second verse i thought eh this guy can not sing later on his album came along his vocals destroy his tracks literally comparing him to other artists such as mario or NUMBER you will realize that he can not sing full stop disappointing,0
raydiation thank god he stopped rapping but now this album sucks too glad it was free he reppin cali too oh hell no the crazy thing is he tried working with some new and other producers like r kelly and timberland and they did him wrong there are only three tight songs numbers NUMBER NUMBER and NUMBER all were produced by rodney jerkins he can not be his sister though this album proves ray j just ai not got it maybe he could if he had just stuck with using rodney jerkins but the beats are not supposed to make you tight your supposed to make that beat what it is and more,0
well done ray j this is a good come back from the aint a game album that album was good wit songs like a minute do we go from here me and invite etc however this album is even better you can tell that he has grown up on this album i think he is making a name for himself in the music business and will not just be known as brandy kid brother my fav tracks on this album are love this song NUMBER bits can not get enough of it tha mood wish i need and the crunk track sweatin however there are a few dodgy tracks on there like actin i was excited when i saw r kelly was on there bt was sadly disappointed when i heard it war is over i liked the last duet they did day in paradise bt after hearing this song they should have stopped then however overall its a good album well done ray j,1
stew well i am i have to say in all honesty a true magnum fan in the past i followed them all the way to see them perform live and at there very best which was in my own personal opinion all the time vigilante is certainly one of magnum s finest example s of good solid heavy rock on any one given cd need a lot of love is one of there finest along with vigilante of coarse and there is also track s like lonely night and midnight on there too i personally have all magnum s cd s as i m so into there genre of music and culture i simply could nt be without but if you like a bit of live in concert magnum then i recomend that you get you re hand s on magnum s live cd,1
do not waste your money i love historical novels and that what i thought this book was with the added bonus of naughtiness what i got was a book with stories i read NUMBER of them before i gave up that had to be written by horney NUMBER year olds this single purchase has me rethinking my loyalty to amazon,0
brilliant reinvention bayard is a startlingly fine writer who has made a number of smart decisions with this novel it not a sequel to a christmas carol as some readers assume it a great thriller that makes just the right use of its source material slyly dropping in details that are a delight if you know your dickens but in no way detract if you are just reading it as a tightly contructed historical thriller remarkable definitely a writer to watch,1
contrived spoiler alert this book is the continuation of the story of tiny tim but as an adult the part where we see who tim really is as opposed to who tim parents wanted him to be was by far the best part of the book the mystery though was just silly there is no way that someone in england at that time when confronted with a child rapist would not have murdered him on the spot and tim not doing so went completely against who the author had developed as tim true nature there were actions such as this one throughout the book that seemed obviously placed in order to drive the plot forward exasperating and annoying,0
too bad it boring the concept was good and it certainly worked in bayard poe novel but after a half dozen chapters i still could not care less about tim the prose tended towards the pedantic and the supporting characters were flat,0
carnivale wow the whole show was entertaining it felt like you were in heaven just dancing to the beats along with ricky the dancers and the band the whole concert was great and really entertaining it felt so much like carnivale,1
once again a great book chopped up like onions at a wimpy NUMBER minutes so much is left out that unless you have read the book a lot of what is happening probably will not make any sense avoid the movie but definitely read the book by my favorite author douglas kennedy,0
dissapointing after into thin air and the climb after being nearly obsessed with into thin air and the climb i eagerly awaited the latest book from lene i also lived in and speak danish an added bonus however i found lene chronicle pretty weak with little background or insight in the writing this book was written more like a journal without analysis and should have been billed as such for gaining insight into the state of mind for lene it was interesting for better writing and deeper analysis about the NUMBER tragedy stick to the other NUMBER books,0
do not bother this book is a total waste of time to read i could not wait to read it when i saw it on amazon com but lucky for me i happen to see it at the library and hurried home to read it gammelgaard is so into herself it makes me sick to think that she thinks scott fischer needed to have her on his team in order for the expedition to make it is unreal she will never be in the same league as true mountaineers like fischer or rob hall save your money on this one i have read almost everything about mount everest and the NUMBER tragedy and this is by far the worst it will never compare with into thin air or the climb also she has a style of writing that i have never seen before she jumps from one thing to another but i can guarantee you it will always be about herself and how strong and great she is,0
this is not a book about climbing mt everest it about being proud of being the first danish woman to do so this sentence is the whole content of the book the most dramatic climbing season on the tallest mountain on the planet is nothing but a mere background to the great self esteem drama gammelgaard is going thru and sharing with us in lots of details krakauer and boukreev run circles around this lady definitely not recommended,0
best show around even if you do not like this programme how could you not it worth buying simply to watch george eads the whole way through he so hot the combination of a good cast and interesting if not often creepy storylines keeps me watching this show each and every week and i could watch all of these episodes over and over go out and buy this now it will get you hooked,1
cj it has a robust taste and a good topping to macaroni good addition for a quick nutritional meal it does resemble a cheddar cheese flavor without the salty taste,1
this is a great game for rookies champs and bored kids this game is fun exciting and easy to learn how to play i got this for christmas last year and i still love to play trust me i have a very short attention span and a complex mind and found this game great pros cool monsters to raise tournaments to win many secret breeds to unlock many tasks to accomplish lots of monsters to pick from challenging for pro gamers enjoyable for untalented gamers rules are not confusing good graphicscons people talk a lot monsters only have NUMBER year life spansthis game is varied so that a variety of people can enjoy at first it is ahhh uhhh okay then once you understand it becomes great fun i had this game in fifth grade and my friend and i shared so much laughter and good memories this is a good game for anyone so try it,1
from the biggest cult of all so someone from the biggest cult of all christianity makes the usual errors about alternative spiritual paths he knows nothing about pure ignorance and bigotry evangelical christianity had done far more damage than the new age ever could by sowing seeds of discord and division their fear based dogma keeps them blinded to the light that is in others their own book says god is love therefore where love is god is where god is love is that what the new age is really all about it that simple but many christians miss the boat they are stuck in fear perfect love casts out fear right did not jesus say to love god and love your neighbor why then do so many christians stay stuck in fear why do they feel they must attack the spirituality of others why not just offer their own spirituality in love to those who choose it and respect the rights of others to follow the spiritual path of their choice,0
pro huh not detail in explaining conceptstoo few numerical examplescontent far too simple to be a desktop ref in the dealing rm poor editing and formatting NUMBER similar to the earlier edition,0
good but not great when i first heard this album i loved it after listening to it more closely i still like it a lot but am not quite so blown away by it when it first came out it might have been groundbreaking but so much has happened since in the world of technical avant garde metal that much of this album now sounds a little tame the material has not aged very well there are a couple of truly great songs in the middle all of the others are definitely good just not mind blowing as some of the material on their older albums still is the new vocalist on this album added a new dimension to the band a great improvement over snake in my opinion if you want a truly great album though get their next phobos,1
i gave it a try sorry i gave this album a few spins but i still can not think of a one good thing to say about it except maybe that it will probably be the weirdest thing you will ever hear can not say it not original but in this case that not necessairly a good thing if you are not familiar with this band this probably would not be the best album to start with,0
does not work on windows xp beware this game does not work with windows xp the vendor said that it would work on any xp version except media center but i have xp pro and it crashes there despite changing compatibility settings to older versions and changing the video resolution i suspect that it like another game we purchased that worked fine when xp first came out but windows auto update changed something that destroyed compatibility with old win NUMBER games like this we have it up and running on an NUMBER year old laptop with win NUMBER but it too cpu intensive to run properly on that old thing the game seems ok for the right pc and operating system though,0
if you love cats get this i have had this book for awhile now and the only thiong i do not care for are the colored charts i just can not do them as a lot of people can not especially the older we get i have a ginger tabby named sassy who looks just like the cat on the cover she is draped over a sofa having that piece will forever remind me of her after she is no longer here to drape over the couch you will not be disappointed if you can get by the colored charts in fact i gave it NUMBER stars because of the colored charts,1
terrible unable to use on my television advertisement did not advise me that it needed a special television to play this game,0
hope may be a wrong concept i wonder does a person have be seriously ill to write such a powerful book like orwell did he had no hope and he imagined all world in his situation that very interesting,1
a timeless classic that an unforgettable must read this is the timeless classic which the term orwellian and big brother are derived this terrifying look into apossible future in which the government big brother holdstotal control over the populace orwell vision of thefuture still holds very true to this day and is a must readfor anyone concerned about the future of technology andgovernmental control hans chen,1
NUMBER orwell futuristic NUMBER was a pleasure to read the detailed symbolism of the antique paper weight crashing onto floor as policemen bombarded in to arrest winston and julia the paper weight symbolizes the end of winston and julia private and secure existence which allow them to be safe with each other they found refuge in the small apartment where they could be themselves without big brother watching their every move it ironic the government was still able to scrutinize every moment of their lives i enjoyed reading this novel i recommend it to anyone who enjoys orwell,1
NUMBER NUMBER over all is a very boring book their are parts in the book that catch your attention but just for a while and then it just gets boring again i do not really like futuristic based books and the book NUMBER is a perfect example why i would not recommend this book to any one unless your into this type of genre i give this book NUMBER,0
not a helpful history book at all i was doing a research paper on the year NUMBER and according to my teacher none of this actually happened i got a flippin f last time i ever read a history book by this orwell scrub he does not know a thing about the NUMBER s not once did he mention def leppard or karma chameleon i gave my copy to a donkey he said it was about communism ass,0
teachers i was so upset to learn that this is no longer required reading in advanced english in high school i ordered it for my son because no one can be considered well read without this in one history,1
if you have not read it you owe it to yourself i just read this for the first time at NUMBER wow what an eye opener the things orwell predicted in NUMBER such as the technology is amazing considering how long ago it was written the politics are messed up by current standards but frighteningly possible the tense mood of the book draws you in and there are moments especially near the end that would be truly terrifying to experience the chapter with room NUMBER i read with a shudder the reason i did not give it NUMBER stars is because it bogs down a few times i understand that this is to explain the world and how such a horrific existence came to be but a slow start to any book is rather annoying,1
scary george orwell prophetic words are coming to pass right before my eyes you see it too if you got off the tv and started paying attention to politicians and the laws they are passing i hope there is a revolution of some sort before this grim forecast is played out to the end,1
disturbing and relevant i am surprised that noam chomsky has not been mentioned in any of the NUMBER previous reviews nineteen eighty four is not just a supreme work of art it is politically relevant because the phenomena identified by orwell doublethink newspeak etc are in various forms actively used today in even the freest societies chomsky gives very detailed descriptions of this i have repeatedly found he says that when the audience is mostly poor and less educated i can skip lots of the background because it already obvious and taken for granted by everyone curious,1
the greatest work of the NUMBER th century what can one say about this book that has not been said before it is one of the most powerful works one can ever read which is forever fresh and remains relevant no matter what era it is read in,1
orwel rolls in his grave this book is incredible so he wrote this book in like NUMBER i believe and hes writing about NUMBER about the future and he was right he does an amazing job writing about how the government controls the people about how the government uses propaganda how the government watches the people listens to the people this book is good if you care about the world this book is good if you are aware of propaganda and how people are fooled by it this book is good if you are someone who does not want to be controlled or fooled kindof like the way we are today sadly,1
a thoughtful read though the novel does drag when you read tracts from the conspiracy manual i found the novel to be rather enjoyable the idea of how the world would be shaped and for what reasons was interesting and the narrator was able to lead the reader into the world and allow the reader to be engulfed into things the end was well done and it was a good closure to the work the character does not die but he is changed indeed he awakens to thye doctrine of the state and accepts it yeah he has been tortured and brainwashed but he does not give in under that torture though seeds are definitely laid if you have the time and you like depressing books about totalitarian states that try to stamp out individual thought and reason go ahead and pick this book up if you want something lighter though i would try to find something else,1
the title should be revised to say NUMBER with the advancement of homeland security here in the united states we are beginning to see the onset of a true big brother the number of agencies fbi cia ins and other alphabet soup organizations are now cross matching databases they are gathering information from local municipalities and those that are in the system better not have anything to hide september NUMBER th accelerated the path that we were already on i hope that some sanity is also metered out in the process after being a futures author investor and broker for the past NUMBER years one of the glaring points in the book is how statistical data is constantly being modified and rewritten to serve who will benefit from the moment i just hope that these mistakes misquotes and misinformed changes never occur in such a draconian fashion great book everyone should have a copy on their shelves,1
george had a good idea but the book really stunk at first i did like the book then it just started to suck right around the time when winston was getting sexually involved with his girl friend i hated the book so much that i forgot her name the first hundred or so pages i liked then it just got really boring so ii highly reccomend that you do not read this book and please for the love of god do not read that brave new world book by hoxley it is twice as worse as NUMBER to put it bluntly do not read any george orwell your just waisting your time,0
two plus two makes four george orwell imagined the future in a dull state where every single thought emotion and action would be monitored by the government NUMBER tells the story of winston living in a socialist country feeling depressed and then deciding to rebel orwell is able to convey the helplessness of winston as well as his routine by use of short snappy sentences however as the plot thickens orwell extends the sentences conveying winton hope and rebellion NUMBER is truly captivating and rather depressing as i read i saw everything in my mind as grey and broken but i could not put this book down,1
a very interesting read at first this book was not a book that i wanted to read it was assigned to me as an english project i s u independent study unit so like every kid in high school i started to dread it as i started to read though the story started to get better and better there were points where i just wanted to continue reading and not put it down the story is very well written it gives you a very good idea as to what a dystopian world could potentially look like although at the beginning it does start out very slow it is a very good read if you read this book and enjoyed it also take a look at brave new world by aldous huxley it is quite similar to NUMBER,1
let us not pat ourselves on the back that this did not happen i had NUMBER ruined for me because i was forced to read it for school looking back it is a truly great book like many of the enduring works of science fiction its lasting popularity rests in the powerful archetpyes and metaphors it tapps into big brother the two minutes hate room NUMBER are all here what scary is how some of this seems to be coming true but big brother is not so much the government as it is corporations just try getting away from a viewscreen nowadays also we watch the tv but the tv also watches us advertisers the internet and mtv control us more thoroughly than the government could ever hope to espire to instead of telling us we are at war with east asia we have always been at war with east asia they tell us what our values are what music we listen to what movies we watch etc we listen to britney spears we have always listened to britney spears orwell would have been so proud,1
boring and depressingly morbid at the same time ok maybe mr orwell intended it to be this way but it still does not hide the fact that this book moves incredibly slow compared to the author other works i read this book because i remember thoroughly enjoying and understanding animal farm years ago and this work was recommended by several of my friends if you want an unrealistic view of a future that is totally morbid and depressing check this out yes this is science fiction and just because some people call it a classic does not mean i like it if you want some of the best in this genre i recommend by frank herbert NUMBER a space odyssey by arthur c clarke or game by orson scott card,0
NUMBER i thought it was a very dull and cheesy book every time i picked it up i fell asleep i had to read it for school and it took forever to get here when i ordered it barely finished it in time,0
masterpiece i read this book for the first time in high school and found it mildly interesting i read it again recently and realized what an incredible piece of genius it really is the other thing i realized is that this book makes perfect sense as a satire of christianity big brother thought crimes room NUMBER it fits perfectly of course whether that was orwell intent i do not know though he was an atheist but i think the book is a masterpiece if analyzed in that way paul gehrman author kaleidoscope,1
NUMBER as true today as in NUMBER for those of you who wrote that this novel does not make sense as a vision of the future and could never happen i would just ask you to look at nazi germany the soviet union from a historical perspective but then again there are NUMBER billion people in china who can not speak there mind without fear of being arrested and the government has control over how many children they can have thank god you live in a country where you can be free to read this novel the themes are as true today as when orwell wrote them the governments desire to control what people will think see clinton mans inhumanity to man see serbs and kosovo children please read the newspaper once and a while,1
i thought the book was great i thought the book was good to read it gave me an idea of how the world really could be if it wanted to i enjoyed reading it i kept me in suspence,1
when already like others here i am wondering if the final seasons of one of the most durable laugh out loud sit coms of all timewill ever be released i bought season NUMBER for a song when borders went out of business expecting a series i loved at the time to have dated badly it had not a great cast with fine funny writers and performed i believe before a live audiencei quickly caught up and like the rest of you have a feeling that i have pre ordereda box set that inexplicably will never be released when already ever,1
might as well fan yourself with your hand and save on batteries i always rely on amazon customer reviews this is the first time i have been so completely disappointed i had to hold the fan NUMBER inches from my face before i felt any circulating air and that was with the fan on high due to the size and shape of the fan blades no air comes out of the center of the fan what little breeze there is comes out in a small stream on the sides of the fan i will not comment on the light since i was not interested it that option just got it and i am sending it right back,0
if i could give this a negative rating i would i guess i was unlucky installed batteries light would not shut off i figured i would just break the lights since i only needed the fan well before i could do that the fan went out,0
like silky velvet dreams the moment i put this cd on and heard the light lulling strum of a dreamy guitar fluttering like soft breezes that carried with them the whispered caresses of sun kissed gregorian chants followed by the ocean spray of some middle eastern voice sweetly singing amidst gorgeous strings and a hypnotic beat i knew this was going to be one journey i be willing to take for many years to come and that was the impression i got from the first track alone imagine what ensued it only gets better from there every song is aptly titled to create a spellbinding mood and while i find this exotically soothing debut album by black ether an astonishingly overlooked group extremely hard to classify because it is so diversified in its use of instruments and styles i have to say if you enjoy lush chillout music with an ethnic world flavor to it than this is most definitely your cup of tea,1
he is not what i remember the cd is not what i remember about liberace he was a great performer and showman on this cd there is very little of his solo piano music very little grand piano type music at all most of what you do get is overshadowed by the background music i was disapointed,0
need to proof read your work this book could be useful if the examples actually worked i have barely reached the NUMBER th page and all ready i have found more errors than should be allowed in an entire book the examples are mis quoted and several do not work the book might be more helpful if the proof reader knew enough on the subject to correct the more obvious errors if you buy this book be ready to experiment with the syntax which may be close but not always correct,0
not recomended do not buy this warmer hi i bought this warmer for a vacation trip i was really dissapointed it wasnt even NUMBER minutes that i had it on for the first time and it started to get on fire melted plastic all over the place smoke like crazy all around the car it is very unsafe do not buy this product do not spend your money do not put your baby in danger if you have this plugged in your car cus the warmer might get on fire mine did i hope this review helps you i will not ever buy this product ever again,0
waste of money i bought this for our first long trip with the baby it was a waste of money and time my baby was on pumped milk so we could not just grab some hot water from a drive thru it would have taken hours for her milk to get warm enough and she is not that patient neither are most babies for that matter,0
it is what is west west yall this album is good for what it is meant to be west coast gangsta music it all about lowridin smokin chronic kickin it and gangbangin in the golden state those who are accustomed to down south music will probably not like some of the west coast funk it a different flavor for some me being from cali i love this stuff it is rare that someone captures the essence of the west i do agree with this not being the best album but it still worth buying it got enough head bangers to get you to the club that cali NUMBER ya NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER stars,1
erotic and romantic one of anne best exit to eden is one of anne best works in my opinion many people were turned off by the film adaptation why hollywood decided no one would want to see a bondage film is beyond me eg but this book focuses on the relationship of master and slave and what happens when the tables are turned anne has many sides and lestat is just one of them true rice fans will adore this beautiful work of fiction,1
wonderful story coupled with steamy erotic scenes this book was hard to put down the story was excellent and the erotic scenes were just as good like all of anne books this one was very tastefully done well worth it,1
stick with sleeping beauty perhaps in it time this book was cutting edge but for those of us within the lifestyle it tame and contrived to a very unsatisfying degree it ironic that the film adaptation was watered down even more and turned into one of the worst movies you are likely to see ann rice did not deserve such treatment there are books that capture the true essence of the bdsm fanatsy that are much more engrossing and interestingly enough ms rice has written them as well writing as a n roquelaure see her trilogy in the sleeping beauty series,0
vile from the beginning let me start by saying that i never put down a book even if i do not like it this is one that i could not even get past the first few pages maybe i did not give it a chance but the foul language and vile event depicted in the first few pages turned me off completely to this book i am glad it was a free download on kindle i gave it two stars only because i did not give it a chance to get better if i had not deleted it maybe i would give it another chance but i certainly will not pay for it,0
spirirt house a boring bloody mess shame on me for buying it shame on me for reading it karen b wisconsin,0
spirit house read this in an air conditioned space reviewer renee s nyc august NUMBER NUMBER the plot is typical noir the hero typical world weary and disillusioned hammett orchandler but the atmosphere is stunning it was a whole new world for me and i fellcompletely into it from vinnie first nightmare to the final dripping conclusion mr moore descriptions of thailand andthe thai people are evocative and real onecan feel the heat and humidity see the swirlsand flashes of colors and almost touch the waves of misery that radiate offthe pages and the story not bad either i was interested in all the little tidbitsabout life in bangkok and the story not bad either there were a confusing numberof characters some of whom did not advance the plot at all and the plotting could have been tighter but all in all i would definitely recommend the book just be sure you read it in an air conditioned space because otherwise you will surely melt from its heat,1
i hate this book i thought this was the worst book i ever read there was no point and way to confusing he would ramble on about stuff not even importnat to the plot i hated reading this stay away from this book,0
re is NUMBER degrees really the temp books burn at if it is then i will imediatly torch the books to bits and pieces the book proves one point to me burning books and their society is much better than ours where farenheit NUMBER can be published,0
not that good fahrenheit NUMBER was a disappointing book for a reader who is not an avid science fiction lover this book is very difficult to read the correctors a sometimes very confusing to understand the setting is also very hard to have a visual picture although the plot is very good the way that it is described is hard to understand i think if you are a science fiction lover that you would like this book but if you sometimes like to read science fiction you will not like this because you have to be a huge science fiction lover to like this i also think you need to be above the NUMBER th grade or a very advanced reader,0
start memorizing this book i do not give very many things five stars bradbury novel is simple powerful beautiful and truly marvelous a negative utopia along the lines of brave new world or NUMBER i like this book more than either of those because it is ultimately utterly hopeful bradbury is in love with a messed up world and his message comes across with an urgency and honesty that is both startling and impressive you know the plot they burn books because they are scared of ideas montag wonders about the ideas and becomes an outcast in a sterile society this book makes me want to change the world and so i want you to read it and then maybe memorize it a quick read and a fairly easy read engrossing enough that you will not want to put it down and once you finish it you might be tempted to just start over and read it again i recommend doing just that,1
dystopian classic wow what a great book about a dystopian society censorship and the need of the state to keep the masses blind deaf and dumb if you enjoyed NUMBER brave new world or the giver you must read this it is now one of my favorites,1
really good this was a good book the part called coca is the best about cencorship the book is kind of like the giver only a lot better,1
what a classic to be perfectly honest i really do not understand how this classic is rated below a NUMBER star by any reader yes i know that every reader has their own personal taste but this story is a classic for the ages every kid in a middle school should have to read this story about how lucky we are to be able to read books no matter what the content or agenda the story might contain anyone who has never read this story should pick up a copy and start immediately it the best NUMBER you will ever spend,1
did not like it confusing disturbing and stupid are some of the few words to use when describing this book firemen who start fires come on burning every book that exists this is not a look into the future it a look into bradbury twisted little mind bottom line do not waste your time,0
a book with many levels what appears on cursory reading to be a story of banned books with reflection is a comment on the systematic suppression of free thought and free speech the book gives insight into how those who look the other way or are concerned with rights only as applied to them can actually further the loss of individual freedoms a very thought provoking novel,1
fahrenheit NUMBER i read this book as a teenager and i wanted my students to read it as well although i loved it i did not get the same reaction as when they saw the video however they did think the video was cheesy d,1
great book to read but not to listen to i have always liked this book to read so i thought i would get it on cd ray bradbury reads it and it is very bad it was so painful to listen to his voice i had to turn it off he reads in such a monotone voice it put me to sleep someone needs to re make the cd,0
do not read this mind numbing drivel this book does not deserve one star it deserves negative NUMBER stars this was the worst book i have ever read the book moved to slow and the characters are stupid guy montag the main character is a fireman who sets books on fire becuase homes are fireproof then he meets this crazy girl nmaed clairese who rambles about dumb stuff of the past that is not important like did you know that one time billboards were only NUMBER feet long instead of NUMBER who cares if there is one book that deserves to be burnt it is this,0
hardly even deserves NUMBER star this is definitely one of the worst books i have ever come across in the modern version there is a forword and an introduction both of them have nothing to do with the story and ray bradbury babbles on and on about his past and how he came up with the ideas for other books that no one cares about i almost fell asleep during the forword i do not know how i survived the book the book drags on and one at a painfully slow pace as for ray bradbury himself he states in the introduction that in his eyes hitler burning and brutally killing people is on the same level as the burning of a book i think that this statement is pretty much self explanatory for his views on humanity great guy eh,0
captivating language needless to say amazing being only a teenager what i have to say usually means nothing or gets no credit i personally loved this book reading it just a day ago i was entirely captivated with the plot and the idea of censorship in the future and that it was precise that it being a book would be censored is unbelievable what possesses any person to censor a book that is so realistic it is amazing to actually prove to the writer that his writings are so precise is astonishing i would recommend this to anyone you do not need to love to read just know how to read,1
ok i felt the author of the book should of described the war a little more still i thought it had some very interesting perspectives on how the world might become i thought it was weird how all the fireman looked the same the mechanical hound was a great part of the story it had us guessing if it would attack montag or not over all i felt this book was well worth reading,1
excellent my NUMBER book of all time i was actually forced to read this book for a high school english class and fell in love with it it simply chilling in it portrayal of the future and the deliberate ambiguity about clarrise is very cool the deeper themes in this book make it one completely rife with feeling a very poignant book it definitely a must read,1
very important book this book is a very important must read for every person living in america at this time in history the paralells that can be drawn from the story in this novel to the dumbing of america that is going on today are quite unnerving and quite scary this book should be required reading for everyone who has ever turned on the television to escape from the world which is just about everyone in this country,1
it will never go out of date i was at the foreign language bookstore on yanan road here in hangzhou when i saw this classic on the shelf would you believe i never read it we read some bradbury in school about NUMBER or NUMBER years ago and he did not make much of an impression on me i can not remember why but knowing the fault could have been mine i gave him another shot books are cheap here and hey it famous right well folks it famous for a damn good reason many in fact fifty years old and it is perhaps more relevant than ever but so what is it good writing does it entertain does it have real characters is it more than just an oh so correct theme dressed up as a novel oh yes it is it absolutely fantastic and i just plain can not recommend it enough if you love sci fi great if not it does not matter i can say transcends the genre with a straight face yes i can i will be reading this one again folks i did not write it and i am just sick with jealousy about it okay,1
bleak blind and boring being forced to read it in school for its so called relation to censorship sp i would have to say burn it althoughthe book is about censorship and why how it is wrong i can not say much good about it the theme itself is good but the story itself is trash one of the most un realistic ideas i have ever heard first off everyone in the country is an idiot second that includes the hero third even those who have minds of their own have no intellegence and finally way to many cracks in the foundation of the story and two many holes in the story itself l NUMBER r,0
fahrenheit NUMBER burning up my brain i read fahrenheit NUMBER this year in the seventh grade as a required reading as i read this book i got more and more confused the plot twisted and turned and left me hanging wondering wait what happened mr bradbury used large words that i learned as vocab i would recommend this book to no one under the age of about NUMBER maybe NUMBER i chose this age because of the hard concepts of burning books and the fast moving plot of the hound,0
sadly a disappointment perhaps it is dated perhaps it was just built up too much but this is yet another book that came highly recommended both by other to day readers and critics alike that i just could not enjoy bradbury tale of a world where books is banned has a powerful and interesting premise but it does not seem to follow through for me which is a shame here is a book that is about the importance of books in our lives but it is so boring that rather than something out of it you just come away thinking how boring it is or at least i did,0
f NUMBER shows how dangerous a person ideas are i enjoyed this book very much because it gives you an extreme look towards censorship and how the media can influence the way we think an individuals ideas and thoughts are shunned for society in general,1
a must read especially for teenagers this is my first re read of this book as an adult i am now NUMBER i recalled enjoying the book a lot when i first read it around the age of NUMBER i recently recommended it to my daughter age NUMBER and she thought it was one of the best books she ever read my attitude now towards the subject of potential loss of freedom combined with mass culture although much more down to earth than it was in my teens is still pretty much the same respect and appreciation of human freedom of expression bradbury is very clear in his fight for freedom the extreme fictional situation he devised is now more real than ever true we are not prohibited from keeping books in this country anyway but we are offered enough mass culture that most people will spend hours in front of the tv rather than reading books or visiting museums i do that a lot too it is hard to believe that this book was written in the NUMBER,1
poor reading i bought this book on tape as read by the author it is excruciating to listen to do not get this i should have known that an actor would be a better reader than an author,0
good fahrenheit NUMBER is set in a time where reading books is strictly forbidden in this world instead of putting out fires and keeping people safe firefighters burn entire houses containing books and occasionally even people one of these firefighters guy montag has doubts about the whole situation and those doubts are strengthened when he meets a freethinking girl by the name of clarisse mcclellan the major themes in this book include the value of intelligence and human interaction i would suggest everyone read this book at least once to help understand why it is important to attain knowledge and break free from ignorance i overall liked this book and would give it a NUMBER NUMBER,1
explains a lot of things from the movie the book was not so good as the movie but the book helps understanding some points that seemed totally random when i saw it compared to NUMBER it miles away but still is really nice,1
fahrenheit NUMBER this book is pretty good except it is definitely very advanced it was very confusing especially the tv family which i did not understand at all it is more of an adult book,0
fahrenheit NUMBER zero NUMBER fahrenheit NUMBER by ray bradburyi did not really like this book it was all just people rambling on and on about how there life sucks the whole worlds sucks and burn books i do not know how you could enjoy this book people just talk to talk in this book its about a guy named montage that is a firefighter he burns things instaed of putting fires out he meets a wierdo girl who talks nonsense this guy starts to think what hes doing starts reading books and gets caught he then has to burn his books he does not want to go to jail so he runs away,0
burn this book hey a reader from missouri i hear you this book makes no sense what so ever and i had to read it for school i have no idesa just how in the world a book this horrible could have stayed around for NUMBER years i have talked to everyone i know and they all read the first NUMBER pages and immeadiatly hated it they rented the movie and watched some of it so they will not have to read it and it was verbatum and guess what it was even worse than the book i do reccomend this book to all of you well only if you want to find out how terrible books can get or you want to find out what type of flammable liquid burns better on books,0
a very dark and mysterious book i first read this book for an english assignment at school after reading the first few pages i was completely lost bradbury expresses a world far different from ours which can seem scary and unrealistic it is very easy to get caught up in all the different things that happen and it is hard to get into the mood of the plot definetly not the greatest book in the world personally i hated the book,0
i tried reading this book for my summer reading it was bad i am sorry this book did not make any sense and i am a straight a student if you have a choice i would not pick this one,0
waste of my time first of all i was assigned to read this book for a class it started out lame and all it did was get worse who cares about a firefighter who burns book now come on i could write a book about books ten times better then that maybe if the books had names and talked then maybe it would of caught my attention,0
this is the lamest book i have ever read this book really sucks it makes no sense whatsoever and is a waste of my time ray should have had better things to do,0
weird weird weird weird this book started out weird and ended up wierd and boring the author has a good idea we should read instead of watching tv but if this book is one of the choices you had better turn the tv back on i mean who in his right mind would ever write a book with NUMBER wall tvs robot dogs and burning books and the story never really had an ending it just stopped i guess to end the boredom i think the author had to get some sort of deal with all the teachers to assign this book how else would it get on the required reading list maybe he gives NUMBER of the profits from sales please do not buy this book you are supporting a lunatic,0
real cranberries i just can say i love this album for the simple reason it is the first one and never equaled in sound elegance quality essence delicate sadness and youth it is incomparable and it deserves to be listen by good and pacient tastes in post xx century pop music i do recomended,1
interesting and sad but very well done this is very interesting film that is really five stories in one a dead girl is found and each story is effected by this in one way or another a great cast and honest dialogue make this one well worth your time the film is ultimately sad and depressing but each story is very interesting with a cast featuring toni collette giovanni ribisi piper laurie and many other talents how can you go wrong,1
motorola phone car charger product is great works like it supposed to order processing and shipment speedy and efficient,1
it worked yep motorola knows how to make an automobile power cord has a convenient on off light that you will never miss it big and bright,1
well made product at fair price i purchased this product with skepticism because it was so inexpensive the auto car charger is constructed well and seems to be made with good materials i have used it for a month and it charges the phone as expected this is how much an auto adapter should cost and not the ridiculous price that motorola and it resellers charge,1
not so good it works that the best i can say about it the outer insulating cover has started to wear off in many places exposing wire after only a month my phone is telling me that i am using an unauthorized charger so no this was not a good purchase and i do not trust the source,0
battle weary this game is horrible the battles are so long slow and unexciting the scenery is cute but alittle dark for gba do not waste your money,0
chalinging game this game is hard and i still hav not beaten it and i have had it for two mothes i reconmend for only skilled players play delta NUMBER thanks for you are time and patience,1
horrible game this game is boring you can not follow the story line and if i had not read the books i would not understand it at all the fight scenes take too long and they are also boring in the mines of moria there is this one place where you have to go but you get stuck because the game has a bug the controls are extremely weird and take a long time to get used to i have bought this game and i do not like it i would suggest not buying it,0
why oh why does anyone play this yes this has good graphics yes it has a kind of zelda theme but really if your looking for a game that fits the lord of the rings best then get the two towers once you are used to that then get the the return of the king that is the best game of them all i have played all three and the fellowship is by far the worst game i have please gameboy do not let vivendi universal the makers of this game ever make a game based on a film ever again they wasted away all the good parts of the books and if you want to fight on this game then good luck to you do not buy this its a waste of money,0
the code of dusty fog i have read the book and enjoyed it it is not one of my favorites but it fills in some of the story line i will be rereading the book i have all of the floating outfit series and am in the process of reading them in order instead of how i purchase them,1
intriguing beginning and then schmaltz i will not go into the plot as other reviewers have already given you a rather complete synopsis after the beginning of the book the character development was weak and disappointing annie starts out as a strong quirky individual by mid book she so hung up on jake that she looses her charm and strength of character jake was just too angst ridden for me to enjoy the secondary characters problems just brought the book down further that and that their major maritial problem is resolved by sex in the sauna well once again a female character melts pun intended i guess i had anticipated stronger female and male characters the ones i get from i think ms wells shows promise but the next book i will get from the library,0
i kept waking up my husband i was laughing so hard when i was reading this that i kept waking him up i then tried not laughing and my body was shaking so much that that woke him up this is a wonderfully funny book and i hope to read more books by robin wells,1
high quality for a reasonable price i recently purchased this case and tested it at depths up to NUMBER feet in bonaire it was easy to open and close and there was no possiblity of having it only partially closed the controls operated all the cameras functions there was no leakage or fogging this case absolutely works as advertised,1
hallmark of the disposable society just throw them away after NUMBER hours i assume these are plastic so folks after NUMBER hours they are obsolete and throw them out to create more useless landfill trash that will last NUMBER millenia yay hooray,0
no availability my rating is for amazon not the product i placed this order and just received a mail that it is not available why is the availability not updated i still see it being available now very disappointing,0
poor quality dvd recording movies are okay but the video quality is poor is this a legit dvd or black market they are watchable but grainy i guess you get what you pay for,0
interesting view into british culture as one would expect these producrions are beautifully presented the quality of the acting is superb england seems to produce character actors of great skill and presence i thoroughly enjoyed the variety of themes presented,1
colin firth need one say more ah colin firth the ultimate consumate actor in a variety of roles a delightful diet of films one a day plus a bonus for the week end and one can have a film festival all their own,1
ones to watch over and over excellent classic style movies all well acted with excellent stars will watch over again many times colin firth is one of my favorites,1
sweet revenge this is the only film i have watched so far this is not up to the usual british cinema quality either in acting or content i did not watch to the end once he found himself tied up in bed i turned it off,0
not worth the great price paying about NUMBER for this collection of NUMBER films could have been a great buy i have traveled to uk enough to know that the british people are generally quite polite polished reserved and mannered with the exception of the englishman who went up a hill and came down a mountain the only redeeming film in this collection hugh grant portrays the real british style well the makers of the other NUMBER have obviously visited hollywood too many times and have drunk their kool aid the courseness vulgarity even offensiveness in dumbed down run on dialogue babbling idiotic nonsense and lack of plausible plot is not up to the usual british polish the NUMBER films that lack class and levity of the usual british approach obviously came from the hog pen of the u s cinema trough,0
warning i highly do not recommend this set you would have no idea reading the description and looking at the picture on the front but most of these movies have a rating of pg NUMBER and there even an r they are mostly about sex sensuality and the like yuck i bought this because my daughter likes the historical movies like pride prejudice and emma etc these are not the same i threw the set away without even opening it the ratings are on the back they should be written on the page,0
great card better than expedcted considering the price of this card its hard to be disappointed i installed it into my freshly built system using a full version of windows xp as i write this i am watching an old episode of star trek tng on a small screen on top of aol the capture feature works great and the the additional goodies from cables to a nice remote controller are exceptional i never use the enclosed driver disk with new hardware and the NUMBER dv was no exception there is not any reason not to download the newest drivers for the initial install i have found it reduces many hassles speaking of hassles i have had none with this card windows xp is such an improvement for handling complex components like the NUMBER dv i would recommend it over hassling over a maxed out win NUMBER system this card costs about the same as a prime NUMBER d gaming card it provides dramatic capabilities ati has really done a great job with this card for the price it can not be beat,1
great card but difficult to setup as the other reviews noted there are problems with installing this card even though i got it working successfully in the end although it is not my top pick for a graphics card i have enjoyed being able to hook it up to my vcr and print my digital videos to vhs yes this is possible although it is a bit tricky to setup i withhold one star on this card for having lack of customer support and being hard to setup if the user manual would have been more comprehensive and if the ati website would have had more help on the subject of installing this card the whole nasty ordeal of card setup that almost all night might have been spared,1
same certain songs from naglfar are without a doubt outstanding esp NUMBER th rising brimstone gate but the songs off of vittra all sound similar i can not really decipher between them most of the riffs are not capturing it is hard to find the cd diabolical which has the songs i mentioned above but already i can tell you that cd is better than vittra,0
louie goose a good childrens book excellent for reading to pre school aged children the text can easily be understood by the NUMBER and NUMBER year olds in my library story hour as they identify with louie and his most favorite stuffed animal a red goose the illustrations are great,1
trite story line with poor recipes i was new to guanajuato and enjoyed the parts of the book the discuss the city but the story line was trite even contrived the culinary part of the mystery included recipes that while tasty are hardly gourmet they mostly consisted of things made with campbell soup not one that i recall was indigenous to mexico at least it was a quick read,0
an unusual writing technique joyce was quite understandably frustrated when his magnum opus ulysses did not immediately receive the critical attention he felt it warranted upon its publication in NUMBER thus it was that the artist while composing his next work finnegan wake got into the habit of periodically banging his head against the typewriter keys a poignant expression obviously of the searing torment boiling within him happily for us the result of these repeated cranial collisions can be viewed in the contents of this volume,0
self indulgent tripe what secondtonone myther rector and maximost bridges maker was the first to rise taller through his beanstale than thebluegum buaboababbaun or the giganteous wellingtonia sequoia went nudiboots with trouters into a liffeyette when she wasbarely in her tricklies was well known to claud a conciliationcap onto the esker of his hooth if i wrote this and attempted to pass this off as a novel no one would ever read it if they did they would correctly assume that i am in fact a pompous erudite fool and by the way i know that there are a million academics rating this book that will come on here and tell me how completely wrong my point of view is but guess what i do not care and i will never actually read any of your responses save it for your poor students and old bearded friends wearing tweed jackets with elbow patches to the rest of you normal people stay away from this book,0
my farts make more sense than finnegans wake ye make a book alas how is life green bay packers sandwich baby eat the president lake like that prose that is james joyce the king of gibberish i made it up but when he does it it is a classic when i do gibberish it is not why what the hell is going on with finnegans wake i do not know joyce must be the genious of gibberish i do not get it,0
naked emperors admirers of this glimpse into madness must have a great need to feel smug and superior such intellectuals are painfully desperate and afraid of reality for it is only in the realm of the naked emperors that they can pretend to be hip,0
mad with vanity that was how english novelist evelyn waugh descibed joyce when he came to write fw and the judgment is apt the book itself is tripe but the contortions joyce fans put themselves through to justify it are always a source of amusement,0
he challenging us to doodle i give this book two stars because it the first and last book to tell us what we already should know that we think gibberish in that ethereal state between waking and sleep finningan wake reminds me of the canvas i have seen at countless art shows with a jumble of random splatterings of paint any one of us could create the same thing why do not we joyce is challenging us to get off our duffs and splatter some paint on the canvass if you think it worthwhile personally i do not do it you could be the next james joyce,0
nietzsche is not the antichrist nietzsche is not fed up with christianity he is fed up with christians and the people who distort christianity nietzsche is not the antichrist he is simply the messenger in a greek tragedy we are the antichrist in reality there has been ofnly one christian and he died on the cross the evangel died on the cross what was called from that moment on was already the oposite of what he had lived antichrist NUMBER five stars for nietzsche three for the lack of notes also there are many times when nietzsche writes in french or latin and there is no note or translation ps i am older than twelve,1
pocket chart it is a birthday present for my granddaughter and has not been opened yet it appears to be as promised and both girls will benefit from it,1
sraight up raw emotions from a female hardcore lovers point of view i have just got to say that hatebreed is amazing by far one of the best hardcore albums i have heard in a while this album is full of raw true emotion it makes me aware of where i am with myself as well as with others hatebreed goes further than just delivering a simple hardcore sound they truly give it in a way that makes me feel the music it has the ability to take one to the emotional edge and back i would love to thank the band personally for creating and sharing thier sound with others and for inspiring me,1
i did not know sepultura was hardcore it interesting that hatebreed gets so much for credit not following in the steps of slipknot or limp bizkit when they now tour with bands like that its also interesting in light of the fact that their music is basically identical to any alterna metal band except without what little talent or melody those bands possess this band has as much to do with hardcore as sepultura i thought this was a joke band when i heard it f you are really interested in hardcore put down that jug of weight gainer NUMBER turn off your victory sampler cd and order a universal order of armadgeddon cd immediately and stop wearing so much adidas newjack,0
hatebreed is the god of all that is god about hardcore hatebreed album satifaction is the death of desire has to be one of the all time best albums i have ever heard i list to a lot of hardcore and and this album never comes out of my disc changer if you are looking for strong lyrics strong music and an awsome groove that you and your friends can kill each other to buy this and never stop listening to it,1
worse than the quest the beginning of the film is nothing more than a hurried attempt to get van damme to the foreign legion where the real story and action begins right unfortunately the rest of the film is nothing more that a snoozefest ripoff of other war movies at least van damme did not do the splits in this movie then again that might have given the film a memorable momement,0
i liked it but my dog does not i had bought one of these for my old dog a large german shorthaired pointer who had a horrible pulling problem and it worked perfectly for him and he did not seem to mind on the other hand i just bought one of these for my NUMBER month old coonhound and it also worked to stop his pulling but he hates it i can not take him for a walk without him trying to get it off atleast NUMBER times i think this may just be because he loves to sniff the ground so much that this kind of makes his head go higher up but now i have to order him something else to stop his pulling because of what difficulty it is to use this for him other than that amazing product in it self,1
imitation brand they sent an imitation holt from china instead of the advertised halti and it cut my dog face i tried contacting them but no response,0
not good for small dogs like lhasas this is probably a good product for dogs with square jaw lines but for owners of small dogs such as a lhasa apso or shitzu beware because of their flatter facial structures the collar slips off and will not hold as it should and speaking from experience the size is not the issue i e even a small size will not work,0
the wild thornberry movie this game is so cool i have only played it once and already i would like to purchase it it has coloring puzzling and even adventures the only time that i ave played was when i was going to a dna lab and i had my gba with a not so fun game so somebody let me play the wild thornberry movie game and now i would like to purchase it once again to say that,1
disappointed i am sure the story is fine but the disk is imperfect lost my packing slip and need to call to return it,0
stargate continuum the story is without a bunchline and not as good as the others stargates that i have bought,0
stargat continuam review by cvf movie was awsome they did bring back general oneill wich i am really happy about that my only problem with the movie was richerd dean andersons character wasent showed enough,1
very pleased as a loyal fan of the stargate franchise since the very first movie i applaud the actors writers and producers director for a job well done it still takes some getting used to a length movie vs for television meaning i was so used to them getting right to it that i had to learn how to sit back relax and let the actors take me there i can only say that i was very satisfied with this purchase and i have a little bit more of stargate in my home where it belongs thanks darrylcincinnati oh,1
NUMBER NUMBER done i am pretty happy with installment NUMBER out of the NUMBER that were promised i have been to a few conventions and have shaken hands with most of the stars but i have a ways to go yet and so do they i am anxiously awaiting the next one,1
it great to have sgc back i hope we will see more of this mini movies though it seems for a story like that a NUMBER hours movie could have been better yet it a fantastic storyline exploring new ways allowing us however to see all of our favorite teams seens over the years while the show was on,1
above expectation the entertainament quality is above the average of the series sg NUMBER i think this film reached the quality level of stargate atlantis,1
video review length NUMBER NUMBER minsthis is my video review of stargate continuum for more video reviews search mikepetel on youtube enjoy,1
great movie butt o grainy on blueray i like all the stargates but this one and ark of truth are way to grainy they look better on standard dvd other then that it another great stargate film,0
one time cooker this rice cooker is good for one time cooking the rice does not last more than NUMBER hours i usually leave my rice for NUMBER days so that i do not have to keep cooking it lazy i returned it and bought cukoo rice cooker made in korea the rice lasts for NUMBER days without changing color or get old cukoo is more expensive but it will last for years,0
the few standout tracks on this album are NUMBER the intro soulstar NUMBER youloveme which should have been the first single not forthenight NUMBER somewhere between momentinlife and thereason otherwise a less than stellar album,0
soulstar not quite there yet i got the feeling when i was listening to this album that he was not there musically or lyrically the majority of this album is just pass and i could take it or leave it forthenight is the only song on here that gets major play in my cd player and he could not even give you five minutes to really get into it the other songs sound as if he was going off into left field now only if he could justgivemeawholealbumicouldlistentoo,0
this cd is really cool give him a break i love musiq even when he had the soulchild do not get me wrong all the songs are not hits but for the most part he is doing his thing on this album cut my man a break he is trying and i look forward to his new album i love his voice his music and him in general the tracks that are my fav are infatueightieswhoknowsforthenightyouknowyoulovememomentinlifewomanopolybuy borrow from a friend or library this cd it mellow like the way neo soul is supposed to be toodles,1
jusbeautiful at first i did not really care for this album but after a couple of listens i love it neo soul is here to stay and musiq is the greatest my favorite tracks are womanopoly babymother who knows and so on this cd is hot and i can not wait for the next one,1
ultimately ineffective this is the kind of book where you realize early on that the writer is not talented enough to pull off what she set out to do sad since i was looking forward to reading this based on the jacket copy oh well this reviewer recommends that others look elsewhere for a compelling read,0
run lola run this is without a doubt one of the all time best films i have ever seen if you are thinking about buying it just do so you will not be disapointed,1
what if this is your bag if you like action fun stunts thrillif you want to see something completely uniqueif you are not afraid of timeblendsif you like fabulous music from some of the hippest german people that make look the far too streamlined usual scores look veeeery old if you like cartoonsif you like to rather sit and hold than to stop the vcr and go to toiletif you like to experience sheer speedso what are you waiting for run to get it one funny sidenote the movie rating was for NUMBER years in germany americans are really funny with their prudery it seems that the americans are as afraid of sex as the germans are of violence,1
my favorite movie ever this movie is simply the best i have ever seen i am very into film but this is simply great because of its wonderful story line a great art direction and wonderful camera work all out a movie everyone should have it,1
a bit overrated actually this is not really even a movie it a really long music video maybe it an advertisement i do not know all i can say is that a good movie requires a few things first and foremost an engaging story and some interesting characters this film lacks both the director is a trickster of sorts who depends on neat stylized filming techniques and devices that attempt to cover up the fact that nothing really happening plot wise sorry but the alternate scenario theme just did not work at the end of the movie your left wondering why you bothered to even watch the first two thirds maybe i missed the point is there a point somebody please enlighten me,0
achtung this movie left me on the edge of my seat and short of breath once just was not enough in the theater i just had to see it again on the big screen i never used to be into movies with subtitles but the effect just is not the same as it is in its native tongue just when i thought it over it just takes you on another turn and another and another if you like fast paced unpredictable action with a soundtrack that fits its movie like a glove this one for you,1
good for hip and knee joints in my bichons this product is palatable and seems to work well with my bichon who injured her knee in a tussle with my younger bichon the joint works well and she seems to not have anymore pain i recommend this product,1
relly chalinging relly quick action you can play tag here is how to play tag youhave to tag all the othere cars wethowt being tagd in retern batell is a chalinging game you fite you can race to,1
just another excuse to make money i am sorry but after reading this book i have to admit that the feminists are right men are pigs and the only reason this book was written was for the authors to make money the book tries to justify its existance by saying it is designed to help you find the love of your life on the internet it actually only helps you find the love of your night if i had actually used any of the tips in the book i would have had alot of sex but i doubt finding my soulmate would have been possible in fact i doubt anyone using this tips would find their ultimate mate it would be inspite of the tips not because of them an entire chapter is devoted to sterotyping women though the authors do try to explain most women do not meet these types then the list over NUMBER to watch out for i am glad i did not actually pay for this i would have demanded my money back,0
NUMBER stars this album is brilliant if you buy it i guarantee it will be the best album you buy all year,1
disappointing this was a very disappointing purchase the hand decorated exotic wooden tea chest appears to be pine decorated with printed paper although the print is very nice the description of it is a bit overblown the tea inside was okay some of the combinations of flavors just did not go well together and often drowned the flavor of the tea,0
thank goodness for amazon my cable was out and i missed my favorite shows thank goodness for amazon where i could watch them and not worry about viruses or signing up for a monthly fee thanks,1
joshua children this is an easy reading but profound story of what children can do to change the prejudices of their elders,1
nice cd but mislabelled this cd is not touch sampler NUMBER which has not yet been released this is touch sampler NUMBER released to commemorate the millenium it a nice cd and the track listing is right but the product title is incorrect see,1
colleen colleen et les botes musique i can not imagine a more limiting instrument than a music box its tones are set in a specific pattern and it does not deviate from that at all but colleen somehow makes music boxes magical again by mixing the traditional plucked sounds with their re processed and synthesized counterparts she manages to evoke a fairy tale mysticism what is a componium part NUMBER goes from thick sonics to singular tones at the end and even it charles birthday card relies solely on iterations of pop goes the weasel will you gamelan for me is its own creation immediately the tinkling comes fast and furious on what is a componium part NUMBER a track that sparkles like moondust calypso in a box shows off the more processed side and has an almost senor coconut feel for its short running time the standout piece here is the final track i will read you a story which appeared on an earlier album but is always welcome anywhere,1
mcduffie elegance and artistry are marvelous i knew nothing of robert mcduffie until i heard him perform the mendelssohn concerto at wolf trap with the national symphony that performance led me to seek out this cd and mcduffie playing here is as lovely on the disc as it was in the live performance his tone may not be as big as itzhak perlman but it is nevertheless exquisite the phrase spun silver though cliched is apt this is true concerto playing the soloist carrying on a conversation with the orchestra and by extension with the listener i definitely will seek out more of mcduffie discs and i hope others will too,1
great value brute force first off let me help you novices out there a little bit do not buy a video card because of its price its hype or its look do your research this card is excellent it is blazingly fast it beats geforce NUMBER and it is a steal br a key feature in the radeon NUMBER is the programmable pixel shaders let me tell you a little more about them geforce NUMBER NUMBER and radeon NUMBER all share them witht he exception with the geforce NUMBER mx the newest games will use programmable pixel shaders and if you do not have a video card that uses this then you can not play it the radeon beats its competition while being half the price but be cautious because there has been driver issues with ati and what seems to be cheating drivers pros blazingly fastcomes from a respectable companyexcellent image qualitycons driver issues,1
not a horror movie a horrible movie this movie personifies everything that is wrong with hollywood these days the characters are superficial the plot anemic and the special effects vastly overused liam neeson leads a cast of characters who spend a few days in a haunted house to gauge their fear reaction the house is possessed by the spirit of its builder who hates kids that is about it a terrible remake of the original NUMBER classic which was the best horror film ever made get the original and save your bucks by letting this one sit in the warehouse and rot,0
absolute crap okay if you are a special effects freak you might like this however there are much better films with equally good effects if you are a fan of minor things like say oh plot character development etc then stay away the NUMBER robert wise film is the scariest film i have ever seen and the scares come from what wise does not show you the NUMBER version was brilliantly plotted and paced with one of the greatest ending lines in film history the NUMBER version has none of this do yourself a favor and see the NUMBER movie or better yet read the shirley jackson novel the only reason this gets one star is because c zeta jones is just so easy on the eyes,0
a truley horrible horror film a truly horrible horror film over use of not so special special effects attempted to divert our attention from the fact that the movie never gained any momentum and that the characters were never developed or interesting the only thing that scary about this film is that someone actually tried to improve upon a classic horror movie so frightening the memory of which still scares me after NUMBER years the other thing that scares me about this movie is the reoccurring memory that i actually paid to see it,0
too awful to be funny i will admit it was years ago when i had seen part of this movie remake that was so bad so corny so awfully un scary that i could not even continue to punish myself and barely made it half way through and i a lover of all things spooky i do recall however three things about this movie the directing was awful the script was terrible and cathy jones i did not know who she was she had not married the old man yet which really launched her career gave a performance that was particularly bile producing and one of the worst things about this movie no i speak in haste there were a number of things about this movie if you want to be creeped out read the book the haunting of hill house by shirley jackson if you must see the story in movie form watch the old black and white original from NUMBER starring julie harris it dark and moody and may just give you a shiver or two along with a tinge of vertigo happy hauntingness wind in hare,0
catherine zeta jones trap is the house on haunted hill so different than the haunting both share the same failure a great old story that can be pictured every year and still make a good thriller but this movie makes it no better than a poor picture good actors good story but not well told with its poor suspense the old classic movies with their limited graphics were much more successful,0
great mystery not so great horror flick if you like super natural mysteries then you like this film it is technically a horror film but it really not that frightening though there is a scene in the movie that made my mother jump about three feet and as a result is not for people that watch horror films for the fright as a mystery however it is really quite good and deserves to be watched over and over just so you can find all the hidden clues for the answer at the end,1
and what a feeble haunting it is no no no what went wrong big budget film with great actors and what do we get a visually appealing film with a completely flat liam neeson and a paper thin storyline catherine zeta jones tries to charm her way through but even though she does an okay job the movie is still bad lili taylor and owen wilson also try to add flavour to it all but can not manage to save the day all we get is a movie with a few novelties but way too little content it all seems to be over before it really begins and nothing really makes much sense and the eerie mood is almost totally absent not a good omen for a horror movie is it i just can not believe what went wrong for neeson usually he drags a movie up not down watch house on haunted hill instead if you are into stuff some people into a haunted house and see if the survive movies then you will se how a proper haunting should be,0
great then zzzzzz then egads what a waste sad sad sadthe waste of talent in this movie is such a sad state of affairs catherine zeta jones is a much higher caliber actress along with liam neeson lame attempts to make this movie palatable is such a crime almost as if the movies set was haunted the beginning of the movie has so much promise you feel the backround of the centralized story has promise you get suckered into the premise this house has to offer then and without warning the silliness begins it is as if you have been thrown into an addams family reunion the story line starts to wander the characters continue to wander and ideas and solutions pop up without a warning or explanation to say a horror movie is not believable almost sounds absurd but this movie gets you suckered in then throws you on the floor flat this is a definite do not buy borrow or rent just wait for cable,0
poor plot the actors in the movie are a great bunch but when the plot is very weak you do not get very much i mean liam neeson hes a great actor but was very weak in this movie it wasnt scary at all the the end of the movie was bad there was maybe one scary part which was when a fake lookin skeleton popped up and made me jump that was all i do not recommend this movie to people who like scary movies b c it was a polar opposite,0
catherine zeta hipboots a fan of both jackson novel and the NUMBER robert wise adadptation i went to this movie expecting it to be underwhelming it was worse in fact it was so bad i laughed my way through it along with the two friends who accompanied me there are so many digital effects that the house seems alive indeed but computer geeks set free with a big budget do not creep me out they are just annoying so is the movie the house shape shifts sighs moans hell even the door knocker gets a reaction shot zeta jones leather hipboots manage to out act her and lili taylor is hilariously bad as eleanor i have got the save the children wha liam neeson is even less interesting than he was in the phantom menace if that possible let us just put it this way i just sacrificed NUMBER minutes of my time to write this review so that you will not waste NUMBER hour and NUMBER minutes of yours on this film,0
typical hollywood pulp third grade mentality third rate dialog not for adults egads i actually bought the dvd shame on me,0
embarassingly bad this is the worst film of all time the only amusement came from making fun of the acting how they got liam neeson and zeta jones to be in this movie is incredible i was looking forward to bathroom breaks so i would miss some of this movie total poop,0
if it ai not broken do not fix it the haunting with julie harris was so good even better for its black and white medium which enhances the sense of the macabre and general off kilterness of the set why do not they remake the wizard of oz now there a picture that could be made much pertier with modern cinematography the cheap set and old theatre style acting throw a damper on what still is a great universal story,0
sadly disappointing this overdone remake of the brilliant NUMBER classic is sorely disappointing if it had been released as an original movie with an original title it would have worked the special effects though good were too much for this movie to bare,0
it may be a modern day classic to some but not to me this NUMBER horror film based on the original the haunting is creepy in some ways but altogether it not really a great film at all it has good acting and the scares and pop outs are clever things that boost my rating from a NUMBER to a NUMBER with an ending that is not perfect but really can hold the movie from completely falling apart the film moves slow in the beginning and it starts to pick the pace soon after and later has it intense ending the film is ok in some ways but ultimately becomes more of a fail than a win but it still is not horrible i liked the house and the setting though that was cool the complete storyline was pretty good also if you want some innovative horror from NUMBER i suggest you get the blair witch project,0
poor re make of a good movie i was originally looking forward to seeing this movie but after i did i wish i had not spent the money the story is lame the actors dull and the story is so changed from shirley jackson wonderful book and the NUMBER movie that it does not even deserve to share the same title forget about buying this botched movie and purchase the older you will wonder why they bothered to make a re make proving that newer does not necessarily mean better,0
a lot better than the factory seat the seat was a cinch to install it took about NUMBER minutes tops and it a lot more comfortable than the factory seat the bike came with,1
great story i bought this book and alamut when was in high school and lost them years ago i was so happy to have it to download and read again on my kindle,1
please the parents and the kids our almost NUMBER year old son knows nearly every word of this album by heart our NUMBER month old perks up when ralph is on and we parents hum the tunes and enjoy the smart lyrics even though we hear this music daily the music is rich and does not go stale and manages to bridge the generation gap,1
too small for a newborn i ordered this bag without any knowledge of how big it was i wanted to use it for a wkend trip i was taking and was shocked at how small the bag was i have a NUMBER month old baby girl and it was way too small for me to carry all of her things in it i was only able to fit a few diapers and wipes and the other small items i was not even able to fit a change of clothes i tried putting a change of her clothes in the back pocket but it made it way too bulky all in all the bag was adorable but way too small for a newborn i would not recommend this bag to any mother with a newborn baby,0
book review book is packaged properly so it is not easy to tamper with it great that it comes with a cd,1
a great buy this book is great for anyone having trouble taking the asvab for the first time my daughters score improved tremendously,1
helped a bit studied the asvab few days before taking the test this book helped me get an idea of the difficulty and what to expect in the test the practice tests on this book is actually harder than the actual asvab so it helped me to study harder versions passed with a score of NUMBER,1
a surprising find the composers of these songs were almost all born in the second half of the NUMBER th century their attempt was to create an american music from native american sources of rhythm and tonality i get the same sense of hearing original music with these songs as i got the first time i heard erik satie the songs tend to be melodic and peaceful and fresh do not expect much in the way of tom toms and movie indian harmonies i love to find songs that go to unexpected places i found that here for a much more sophisticated review search american indianists and fred flaxman,1
NUMBER for the NUMBER st NUMBER for the NUMBER nd while i loved both movies jean de florette and the sequel manon of the spring i would rate the first of the pair to to have an edge over the second they are both masterfully done and you really can not watch just one of them as they are an inseparable pair the first movie forming the background for the second and the second providing the resolution for the first without giving up too much of the story these movies tell a story of greed accidental murder and resolution with the likes of greek tragedy critically and tenderly revealing the mysterious nature of the human heart two of the best set of movies ever in my lifetime my only criticism of the NUMBER nd movie is the weak portrayal of the young woman which came down to either poor direction or perhaps a poor casting decision overall this flaw can be overlooked as these two movies will stand as classics for many years to come,1
make sure you see jean de florette first this is the second part of a two part series and picks up where jean de florette leaves off if you do not see jean de florette then you will be missing much of the background of this movie and the context is important for example without viewing the first movie the viewer will not know manons background what happened to her father and their farm the viewer will also not know the full relationship she has with the soubeyran clan the quality of the dvd picture is avarage the picture is fairly clean and clear,1
does not work with minolta dimage NUMBER i digital cam i bought a simpletech compactfalsh card of NUMBER mb to use with my digital camera minolta dimage NUMBER i but it does not work the card works fine on my pc but there is a compatibility problem with the digital cam i guess simpletech must be aware of the problem since their tech support e mailed me that they would post a patch on their website as soon as they would find one but of course i had no clue of the compatibility issue before buying the card so i hope this might help some potential buyers,0
will die do not buy it very simple everything i have ever owned by simpletech has died on me including this drive NUMBER usb sticks NUMBER sd cards and NUMBER cf card not one of their products lasted me more than NUMBER years and caused me a lot of headache,0
my favorite book of all time i can still remember the force with which the first two or three paragraphs hit me reading them in a bookstore in albuquerque inventive humane human magical,1
simply superb i have read this book in both spanish and english i believe it is simply the best novel written in the NUMBER th century no where else does a book burn with the fires of imagination and dreams like this one it touches my soul with a something magical creating the world of the buendias inside of me someone once said finishing the book is like waking from a dream i agree,1
this book changed my life before reading this book i had never realized that a book could be a piece of art as easily as a painting this book is akin to beauty bound in pages it is utterly amazing i personally do not understand why people say it is difficult to understand and even more difficult to get through i could not put it down it simple spoke to me rules to follow while reading this NUMBER pay attention and savor and NUMBER open your mind,1
macondo la capital del mundo gracias a este libro recien llegamos a descubrir que toda la humanidad habito en algun momento en macondo olvidensen de las grandes civilizaciones del pasado este pueblo perdido lo abarca todo amor odio guerras y los buendia son como cualquier ser humano de este planeta esta novela son de las que se leen de un tiron no importa que afuera pase un viento huracanado como el que destruye al pueblo al final al cerrar la ultima pagina todos llevamos algo de macondo dentro de nosotros,1
too boring to continue i only made it to NUMBER pages the book is just boring a lot of sound and fury signifying very little there are marriages there are deaths there are love affairs there are suicides there are battles so a lot does happen but i do not care about the characters if you do not care about the characters then all their quirky faults seem abstract and dull like dusty butterflies in a catalog their various lives are chronicled it a dry description of their adventures and i am left with a so what maybe his dryness passes for sophistication but this book left me cold,0
columbian family values marquez book takes the reader through the lives and times of what i hope is an atypical columbian family covering from roughly the NUMBER s to the NUMBER s it was fun in parts but oddly repetitive with a style that seemed half magic realism half freud and of course the standard enervating anti american diatribes were thrown in i guess a latin american author even in magic realism mode can not overcome his predilictions,0
NUMBER pages of boredom the first paragraph of this book is one of the greatest in literary history it enough to compel the reader to read the next one hundred pages unfortunately the book becomes one of the most overrated in history many of the praises given say the book is difficult confusing and yet they come to the conclusion it is a great book why why not just say that difficult and confusing books are not very good this is a parable with many characters magic realism a genre that deserves to be ignored though that another discussion to give marquez credit his magical realism is a response to the limits placed upon him by the government he lived under but it is nevertheless a poor literary form and when imitated purely awful and the intertwining of lives but they just do not move the story only makes the reader wonder what the big fuss is all about marquez book about miguel litton and news of a kidnapping are much better but this book just bores and bores,0
my NUMBER book this book changed me it changed the way i look at things the way i observe all the events in my life it wasnt easy to read at the beginning but this book helped me get rid of depression writing the characters names with a brief about each of thm will help you alot,1
you must read this book this was my first encounter with the magical realism style and i love it the buendia family is quite possibly the most intriguing i have encountered in any book a must read,0
emporer new clothes i am one of those obsessives who forces himself to finish any book he starts so i plugged away hoping i experience the enlightenment all these other reviewers seem to have found but i just did not get it maybe it lost something in the translation but i prefer a little dialog in my fiction even in my heavy pretentious intellectual and politically correct fiction i do not mind the magic realism but i do get bored with sentences that run on for two plus pages without a period oh well chalk up the dissent to a libertarian crumudgeon redneck who educated beyond his intelligence but i was underwhelmed,0
u will never read anything like it i read one hudred years of solitude like NUMBER times over the years and it still holds its magic and atmosphyre just an unbelievable classic it feels weary and long at moments also distracting at moments but its originality and magical ventures arise and fill the soul must have,1
one of the best ever i have read this book NUMBER times and i can read it NUMBER times more and never get tired of it this is what a great piece of literture can do this book has such unforgetable scenes that one can not differenciate between dream and reality that exists in the story but takes over your mind and do not let go till you set aside the book and even after you will be captivated by the imagineray that has gone into this masterpiece,1
a haunting and incredible experience i approached this novel with reluctance a friend recommended it but said it was best to read it in the original spanish i do not understand spanish but i decided to try the english translation i was overwhelmed for days i was in a trance i could not and did not want to pull myself away from macondo and the buendia family the words hypnotized me the scenes evoked haunted me during the day and filled my dreams at night gabriel garcia marquez has created a masterpiece in any language,1
lesson in the depravity of man as i opened this book i thought to myself wow this seems like a great story i found myself growing more depressed and disgusted with every page although the style and marquez technique are unquestionably wonderful the overlaying themes of lust lack of self control and immorality outweighed the good the goal of nearly very character life is the same to please him or herself very few characters are in the least bit caring of self sacrificing the only way i could reconcile myself to reading this disapointing work was the fact that it is a lesson in man depravity i realized that every person without god intervention is just as bad or worse than marquez perverse characters the book is not without its high points i loved the ending the mystery of the segundo twins and ursula strength there are some passages where the language is incredible marquez is a mastery of imagery i only wish that there had been more positive images to remember,0
could never read this book this is what i think my problem is i did not like the translation of the book if the novel was written in spanish and then translated into english i would sit there and say to myself that i loved the descriptive but not the flow of the sentence i am compelled to give this novel another try based on these reviews it has been a few years and i feel it is well deserving,0
excellent translation of marquez masterpiece this translation of marquez quintessential work does great justice to his remarkable prose the clarity and depth of hundred years symbolism and the excellent development of the buendia characters send the reader back to an austere but complicated time a time of exploration political upheaval and social transition one criticism of this translation is the absence of footnotes to specific historical cultural or social elements of life in colombia in the past two centuries taciturn silent insensible to the new breath of vitality that was shaking the house colonel aureliano buendia could understand only that the secret of a good old age is simply an honorable pact with solitude p NUMBER overall a great read,1
great card this card has to be the bast purchase i have ever made the grapghics are great it directx supported a biggie and is far superior to most cards of the same price the reviewer who says it does not work obviously knows nothing about computers to know well enough whether his motherboard will work with the card if he bought the agp card maybe he should try the pci anyway this is a great video card from a great company for a great price buy it,1
the best discworld novel for beginners or veterans i have read nearly all of them and this is my favorite definitely check out the ones with death in a lead role like mort for instance,1
pratchett i just love him the whole city watch series is just about my favorite bunch of books i have ever read i almost have to read them alonme because i get the whole family looking askingly when i laugh out loud great stories obviousl y fantasy but so real and if you love word play you will never find better,1

terrible product did not work and company unreachable i purchased this item for my son and it did not work right out of the box i followed all the terrible instructions and it still did not work i went to the coby website for answers and there was nothing there either i then attempted over NUMBER tiems to contact coby via telephone and was never able to get through i finally returned the product for a different bran i strongly suggest buying something else with a longer battery life and much better support and documentation,0

kindle version of bantam classics un readable i was looking for a well structured side by side version of the canterbury tales bantam classics normally does a great jobs on books but whoever transcribed it to kindle did not know kindle at all left it unstructured and the translation all over the place intermingled with the lines translating the wrong verses and generally just all over the place practically i am reading four lines middle english five lines modern three lines middle english NUMBER lines modern NUMBER lines middle english and so forth there is no connection between the middle english and its translation that was a wasted NUMBER NUMBER usd for kindle version and a huge disappointment,0
beware of editions by general books llc beware of editions by general books llcthey produce books by scanning ocr copyright free material but without any editing there are so many errors though that the result may be unusable usability probably depends on subject matter but the many ocr errors make even prose an annoying read especially mathematical and technical texts and texts with notes can become completely garbled see the review of j m keynes a treatise on probability on this site which i bought but is useless and similar comments by other buyers on vanity fair by thackeray on the italian by radcliffe,0
kindle version is very poorly edited the content introductory notes translation is great this is one of my favourite adaptations of the canterbury tales into modern english the kindle version however complete ruins the book the printed version presents facing page translation which works great the kindle version attempts to do that having one after the other not considering that due to the font size adaptability this does not work at all,0
aaarrrggghhh why did i think this rendition of the cantebury tales was translated into modern english it is the second of three items purchased from amazon and a second disappointment perhaps i should not shop online regardless it is a classic and i suspect not read by nearly as many who would enjoy it,0
cnnterbury tales oxford word classics this translation allows you to read the stories which often are in poetry with pleasure i found the stories to be earthy funny but sometimes sad,1
great movie poor audio transfer it is so incredibly disappointing that when such a fine film is released on dvd that the audio would be out of synch does anyone know if this an inherent problem with all the pressings,0
tedious and self inflating i am always up for another look at the titanic especially if new light is shed on the story unfortunately pelligrino spends a huge percentage of the book referring to himself admiringly in the third person or subtly inflating his own worth in the parallel story line of ballard expeditions on top of that it not interesting the retelling of the events on the ship are fine but they can not carry the deadweight of pelligrino attempt to make himself a central figure or as important as the story it the literary equivalent to watching an actor talk about how moved they are by their own acting pass,0
this is gold jenna reid has produced a debut solo cd of sheer quality from start to finish this young woman is such a stunning live performer its a joy to see she has produced an equally impressive studio recording stripped bare of over production lets her talent be heard fiddle playing of the highest order,1
excellent fiddle i really enjoy this album and the level of playing is admirable there is a good range of tunes which fit together well as a whole i think i listened to it about NUMBER times in a row when i first got it,1
this coyote is no genius the usual girl goes to the big city cliches not as bad as what you expect from mr bruckheimer thanks to the lovely and charismatic ms perabo and a nice performance from mr goodman as dad still a gal who aspires to write songs and has absolutely nothing to say that whole whitney mariah thing yecch the bar scenes have a certain energy to but the other coyotes apparently have no hopes and dreams or personalities here hoping the adorable piper will get a great or even better movie in the near future i will definitely be following her career,0
good movie these coyotes are not ugly this is a really good cheesy movie that girls and guys will both like however if your boyfriend does not like these types of movies then put in the unrated version in the regular version the kissing sex scene does not show anything but the unrated version shows lots of skin and is pretty steamy it definitely a cutesy movie but the eye candy and bar scenes will keep the guys watching piper perabo and the rest of the girls will not disappoint i promise,1
the bar scenes were cool but that about it i bought this movie because i love jerry bruckheimer movies i should have just rented it the only entertaining part of this movie was the bar scenes all of which were shown in the trailer that about sums up the good scenes when i watched the featurette about how hard they were looking for a lead actress and how excited they were to find piper perabo i could not believe it perabo acting was so annoying she ruined the whole movie for me her fear of singing in public just became more and more irritating as the movie proceeded i just wanted to smack her and say just do it and stop your whining and sniveling i am one of those people who like all kinds of movies even some really bad ones but this is one that i do not think i will be watching again,0
coyote stupid this movie is so dumb how dumb is it this movie is so dumb that even though it has a bunch of hot chicks dancing around in sexy clothes provocatively it is anything but sexy and provocative dumb dumb dumb did i mention that it stunk too,0
absolutely horrible this movie is one of the worst i have seen in the past year right there with the whole nine yards and cruel intentions the plot is predictable the actors worthless or maybe the plot just was not any good and there really no good reason to watch it see if this movie were at least rated r and they actually showed some t a instead of just hinting at it maybe there be a reason to watch this movie what with all the hotties in it however bad dialogue combined with predictable plot bad performances by actors and hotties but no nudity makes for a totally worthless movie what a waste of my time,0
great movie i love this movie i watched it the first time with my best friend and then realized that i had to have a copy of it because its such a great movie,1
stunning i bought this cd initialey by mistake i was in a hurry and missed the cd i wanted right next to it it must have been god hand directing me to this stunning album i had only heard the band on the radio and by the time song one was over i was hooked i sat there and let shirley manson rich voice enthrall me through the rest of the cd i went out immeadiately and found their first cd which was just as good but in a different way that is what makes this a great band among other things the ability to reinvent without loosing the soul sound of the music two great albums i can only hope that they grace us all with many more,1
a must have not a bad song on the albumn this cd is even better than the first and if u are thinking about getting it my advice is to go buy it go spend a measly NUMBER bucks to get it its well worth the money,1
rocks best get it its amazing how this sounds very odd the first time around you hear it then slowly it just hits you and you can not stop listening to it also this cd is sorta more insane literaly than the first one and its abit more slow paced rocks get it also this is the cd that got me nuts about garbage too,1
great garbage rocks shirley manson has a uniqe voice which is great the music for this record are very expressive and the tunes are very singable,1
the album grows on me i bought garbage first album first and i thought the album was great boasting good tracks like milk queer only happy when it rains but the sophomore album was even better waits started out with manson menacing voice with simplistic lyrics like i tell you something i am a wolf but i like to wear sheep clothing the second track had a rockier edge to it and then slowed down with and then it was fun all the way till you look so fine which ended the album with a sombre note like how garbage ended its first title with milk a great buy almost perfection you will just repeat it again and again without losing interest,1
shirley yum garbage is a band like no other you really have to take a listen to this amazing band to realize how one incorporates so many styles into one little album this album is packed full of classic garbage songs that can really give you the chills the opening track temptation waits was very eerie the first time i heard it and i loved it the next track i think i am paranoid has that heavy bass and light vocals that the band is known for love the lyrics too a great album for anyone looking to continue digging thru garbage a word of advice though do not bother with beautifulgarbage if you are a rock fan defienatley not impressive,1
shirley the boys do it again garbage deliver more terrific euro trash rock on their second album NUMBER version NUMBER NUMBER another mix of crunching guitars wild beats groovy keyboards effects and the sensual voice of shirley manson the band are still the frontrunners of modern rock with such great rockin tracks as temptation waits i think i am paranoid push it and my personal fave sleep together there also playful pop rock with special with shirley tipping her hat to the pretenders chrissie hynde at the end the delirious hammering in my head and the truly gorgeous you look so fine fabulous music production from a fabulous band version NUMBER NUMBER is essential garbage,1
great show been watching this show on dvd since i got it it made me even make want to get season NUMBER in the store which i did it a great show one of my fav shows,1
great after reciving the NUMBER th season set and it would not work i made a short phone call and had a replacement the very next day wow what service my grand daughter also thanks you,1
absolutely engrossing and wonderful movie disregard stories about how hellman cooked up this story and then passed it off as true or about redgrave protest at the oscars both apparently true certainly the second one is just see this movie because it simply one of the best movies and stories of all time the script and acting are both top notch,1
julia if you like jane fonda or vannassa redgrave you will like this movie the content is dark but considering it wwii that will not be a surprise the movie is touching sad and in someways makes you feel nice about love and friendship and in another way makes us wonder how far we go in the name of friendship,1
review of julia dvd arrived quickly and safely good srvice would use these folk again no problems encountered first saw this film in the early NUMBER at a seaside picture plcae on the east coast of england bridlington was charmed by thew story and the actors loved the moody scenery the dvd reflected the original perfectly and was most enjoyable,1
glich heaven i bought this game thinking it was going to be cool as hell but i was sadly mistaken when i got halfway through it and i kept hitting glich after glich i thought it was my xbox but i took it to a friend and glich after glich i guess i got the worst game in history but that what happens when you get a massed produced game like this one,0
wonderful flow what a great video i just received it and went through the routine the flow was wonderful i am not a surfer have never surfed i was just looking for a good video and everybody recommended this to me but maybe now i will be surfing by summer,1
do not waste your money there are many better yoga dvds to choose from as a surfer there is no special surf yoga as opposed to regular yoga any surfer who takes the time to practice yoga will benefit peggy videos lack the vital instruction that beginners need to do poses properly without injury it is a real shame as she has so many famous surfers supporting her efforts to spread yoga in the surf community a better option is shiva rhea shakti yoga which provides excellent instruction and a yoga matrix which allows you to create your own unique routines most dvds become stale after awhile but the yoga matrix on shiva rhea dvd in addition to the NUMBER ready made routines prevent this dvd from ever getting old,0
another bogus how to be a better surfer dvd this is perhaps the worst of all videos out today of its type if you have a basic knowledge of yoga you do not need this at all you can create and tailor your own workout if you do not know yoga it useless the instruction is poor peppered with a split screen of people surfing and practicing yoga no wonder the surf mags think it great with little very poorly demonstrated techniques of basic yoga in some scenes you can not even see their feet a crucial failure even if the instructor says what to do save your money take yoga long enough to learn it properly then apply it to your own surfing yoga is great for surfing but this is a poor video,0
do not do it if you know anything about yoga do not buy this cd the only positive parts is the location and view of the waves this is more a novelty than useful honestly who does yoga in a wetsuit at pipeline try ali mcgraw video for a great intermediate yoga tape,0
no book key i purchased this book under the impression it had a book key for quia required by my profesora it did not have any book key so now i have to return it and just buy the one from the bookstore like i should have done from the beginning also ups was a day late and did not leave the book as i requested by signing the leave package form left by the delivery man i had to go pick it up myself because i am never at home,0
needs some modification this thing is ok but realize you must hold it onto your blow out port to make it work therefore you need NUMBER people to blow out your pipes when you are blowing out an rv constant air pressure is the key so saying that i ripped off the needle and attached an air chuck fitting to it now i just screw this on attach my air hose and pop on the compressor and i no longer need to hold it in place,0
nigerians an industrious people when i selected this book i was looking for a book i could share with young children ages NUMBER years and up to give them a glimpse of nigeria its people and culture i liked the photographs which accurately depicted various professions lifestyles in nigeria and some of them provide wonderful ideas for story book extensions for example the photograph of the grandmother making a traditional outfit could be complemented by presenting to the children a few yards of woven fabric that is typically used in nigeria for such outfits other professional roles we see nigerians in are baker doctor wood carver carpenter lawyer potter blacksmith and finally the traditional native doctor or herbalist who gives us an excellent botanist lesson on plants and their healing properties all in all it paints nigerians as an industrious people which is what we are,1
if you love the songs on noddy do not buy my son was very excited as we put the cd in the player but when the music started he was very unhappy the songs do not sound anything like the ones on the show the melody and pace are different and the performers are not interesting do not buy if you are familiar with the songs,0
nice experience this is my first lou reed video i can honestly say that i enjoyed it i have gained some new perspective on lou music he is a true professional before i turned it on i knew i would like my favorites sweet jane and walk on the wild side but i found myself enveloped in the other songs which i had never heard before i was a casual lou reed fan i think if i liked it then a real hardcore fan will love it the video is high quality and the sound is great it like having a front row seat i am glad i purchased this one,1
a rebuttal to jazzie of hampstead london do not know what you were looking at your last graf where you make up some quote from lou at the end of the show is totally bogus in fact lou says just the opposite pay no attention to that innacurate review lou has his good nights and his bad nights this was one of the best performances of his career,1
native american herbal remedies so far i really like it it very informative and useful i would have given NUMBER stars but i have it on kindle and in hindsight would have rather gotten the book in paper it difficult to flip through the book and find what you need but i am fairly new to kindle so maybe it just me or old fashion enough to prefer a book in hand but i do recommend it in whichever form you prefer,1
blleeuurrgghhhh i have listened to this single and i want to feed it to the garbage can man i urge you to avoid it at all costs you will not notice the insipidly simple tune working it way into the core of your being and thus transform you into a similar state of insipid simplicity for kylie minogue i can find many uses for her music i find none,0
dad is in trouble this movie is about two twins who look alike and they are on there own soccer team they switch teams without their mom nowing,1
can not stand those male co stars i think this movie was great i just could not stand the bad acting of the guy mary kate character liked he seemed to be angry at her even when they were just talking yuck,1
bad acting this movie had bad acting the dad is dramactic and corney the mom is just corney and all of the soccer coaches are acting like it was big pro sports championship the olson twins were corny but entertaining to watch this movie is unrealistic that emma ashley and sam mary kate were on NUMBER different teams it a rule that siblings be on same sports team this movie has bad quality actors and a unrealistic plot,0
switching goals a very good movie switching goals was very good the plot was better than the average mary kate and ashley movie but it was not as funny or had as good of acting as the others this movie is good to watch a couple of times but only a couple times if you have extra cash though i say get it you will not regret it,1
entertaining but freaky my son wanted this video so we got it there is a danger in making things that children think are real maybe a few more warnings in the video saying this is not real would be good,0
will bore you to death langston hughes is definitely a better poet than he is a novelist i found this book to be lack luster and boring although you may like a character or two in general the characters were not developed nor were they intriguing his wording lacked the rapture that we are accustomed to him delivering,0
a good book i really liked this book the characters were intersting and the relationship sandy had with his grandmother made me think of my grandmother the book would be good for young people to give them a idea of what black life was like back in the NUMBER and NUMBER,1
not happy i contact the company by e mail to return the product as directed the company e mails back to ask for a reason and if the product was opened i replied and the company did not what is the next step to return the product,0
nice suit it is a great suit great buy great service all around i would highly recommend anyone who is looking for a frosty suit to buy one of these,1
worst test prep book i have ever used as other reviewers have suggested this book is full of errors i used this book along with the official guide and the rea book which is much better for my preperation and found it to be virtually useless there are so many errors that i found myself unable to trust the book as a source on any information that i did not already know to be accurate which of course defeats the purpose of a study guide many of the mistakes are obvious but perhaps more problematic are the several instances where the author explains a subtle point in error this book is not worth the time,0
preliminary review i just began using this book to review for the gre in april i have not gotten very far into the book but in the first NUMBER pages i have already found four seriously misleading errors and that just the ones i have caught some of the equations even the henderson hasselbalch they provide are wrong there is even a convenient example worked out with an erroneous equation you can use this book to learn about what topics you should study for the gre but do the actual studying from real chemistry textbooks,0
wild wild west this is an awesome soundtrack it is fun and enjoyable to listen to the best songs on this cd are all of them if you have not listened to this cd then i recommend you do,1
is not there a larger version of this game this is too small for the age of child it designed for i swear there used to be a larger version plus it did not survive more than a few sessions of our play group before the spring broke,0
disappointed my NUMBER year old son received this as a christmas gift once it was initally set up he had a blast when the teeth chomped down on his finger very gentle however after NUMBER rounds of play we were unable to get the teeth to pop back up or to get the rest of the teeth to push down needless to say he was very disappointed as was i does not appear to be very durable or we just got a bad one,0
it great when it works i specifically bought this toy because it was self contained with no parts to loose it was to be taken on a trip to visit with my NUMBER year old grandson what fun we laughed and pushed the teeth down while taking turns well after less than a day the only tooth that would cause the jaws to snap was the center tooth not too much fun there i feel i wasted my money,0
the bad quality does not ruin the concert yes this video is bad quality but it is great to see bowie and the spiders in their final concert bad quality or not i am only NUMBER and obviously never had the privilidge of seeing them live so this is a great opportunity i believe the ziggy era was the most fascinating and exciting adrogyny is the only way to go,1
goodfun imagine action films were NUMBER minutes long there would be no time for sub plots or romantic involvements or no you go on without me all there would be is car chases and explosions godwill book is rather like that i liked it forget the measured blend of theory fact and example which is the style of authors this book cuts to the chase and it works you see tomcat is a servlet runner it is not that interesting or even the best of breed jetty is way better tomcat is as interesting as what you do with it and goodwill drags you along through a flash tour of all the goodies its a bit like a night tour of naples on the back of an italian cigarette smuggler vespa somehow at the end despite not having understood much you find you know your way around and feel comfortable exloring further on your own take it or leave it that just the kind of book it is,1
borinmg dumb a waste of time glory for old time movies that try to claim a life in a new world and they do not do not bother a nice tape to record over and the last time i buy a film because brandon frazier is in it naked or not,0
best film of the year one of the best films ever made gods and monsters works on many levels it presents the many roles men play gay straight husband bachelor parent child lover monster youth elderly whitecollar bluecollar wrapped in a captivating story listen for the music it hauntingly beautiful,1
see this movie just for ian mckellen performance gods and monsters is a superb movie about the last days of gay film director james whale who directed frankenstein and bride of frankenstein the acting is superb especially ian mckellan in the lead i thought it dragged in a few areas but on the whole it was a great movie,1
best screenplays have more stability one of the few recent films that i anticipated to be good and it exceeded my expectations sir ian mckellen once again performs well the real surprise here is brendan fraser thanks to bill condon amazing screenplay fraser is study of expressive and innocent contrast to mckellen anguished and self defeated character make a point to get this one best screenplays consist of strong dialogue pacing and narrative the oscars are usually accurrate about that,1
tree arrived bent and poorly packed the manufacturer packed this product so poorly that the plastic joints between sections of the tree were smashed and the pole in the center of the tree was bent beyond redemption i have no idea how this tree looked all put together since i had to repack it and send it back thankfully amazon com return policy is generous and swift they get five stars for service in the meantime it was a real tree for me again this year i may try to go with an artificial one next year but will not order one online again,0
a legendary story by robert creamer of the NUMBER baseball books i have read babe the legend comes to life is my favorite creamer wrote the book while some of the old timers were still alive and this makes his story come to life if you want to learn about babe ruth this is the definitive book to read,1
a great book on a sports legend this book was excellent the author gives us an intimate portrait of one of the greatest and most colorful athletes of the NUMBER th century babe ruth overall we learn a lot about him and baseball during the roarong NUMBER into the NUMBER my only issue was that i did not like the way the book abruptly ended with his death i would have liked to have read more about his funeral and the aftermath of his death plus i would have liked to learn more about how his legacy was treated the years after his death nevertheless this book is a great read and i highly recommend it to any baseball or sports fan,1
this will make your install a breeze my car is a NUMBER honda civic ex save yourself a headache and get this if you have to replace your stereo plug and play,1
great summer read this is the first book i have read by meg wolitzer and overall i enjoyed it the plot brings three just turned thirty friends into close and prolonged contact with the NUMBER something mother of their recently deceased friend wolitzer is able to pull this off because she obviously likes all of her characters their various flaws notwithstanding she also has the type of sense of humor that allows her to ligthen things up when emotions and events threaten to drag things down too much the strongest character is the mother natalie who is one of the more appealing baby boomers in recent fiction and by no means a mere caricature my only objection is that several secondary characters are not as clearly drawn as the main ones but in fairness to wolitzer in most novels the reader would not even care about knowing more about such relatively minor characters and it only her gift for making you care that makes this an issue at all,1
gripping novel about the loss of a child the novel is a wrenching page turner about a woman loss of an adult daughter and her subsequent attempts to cope and live the author artfully describes experiences of the mother and the dead woman friends as they provide each other with memories and support needed to adapt to the sudden death of a young woman whom they loved it is the best book i have read all year,1
if i could rate it NUMBER stars i would have i looked forward to reading yet another meg wolitzer novel and i was very disappointed in fact i lost interest early on and never finished it some of the author earlier works such as sleepwalking and hidden pictures were excellent what happened,0
helpful start good book to start with motivated me to get more books to read more about the nuances and subtleties about the game,1
sooo dissapointed i got this book because it had such awesome reviews i am going to be taking a test in the near future and you are allowed to use a medical dictionary and i picked this one i have been taking practice tests on the first practice test i took the first NUMBER out of NUMBER medical terms i tried to look up were not in the book i was stunned and several of them were pretty basic words that i just wanted to get a very clear definition of i am not sure it even going to be worth lugging this book to the test or even keeping the book i may just sell it and try another book jane,0
material too flimsy i bought this bed recently for my NUMBER year old lab mix he does not dig chew or abuse things in any way so i was not concerned with getting a super abuse proof bed but after a couple of weeks of limited use i found a hole in the soft side of the bed the fact that this side attracts hair is unfortunate but a hole being made almost immediately makes this bed not worth buying it may have been a decent design if it was made with sturdy materials very disappointing,0
disappointed i love this video unfortunately it does not show on a blue rays dvd player which means i can not enjoy it i was a bit frustrated however other purchases in the past have been great through amazon,0
looks feels like a bootleg product my copy even has an arrow pointer on the front cover picture talk about lousy merchandising no dolby much less dts only a pcm stereo recording video is average like proper packaging and presentation were no more than an afterthought all in all this looks like a bootleg edition and no it an official release amazing messy what were they thinking,0
underappreciated effort while even some members of the bonzos give this album low marks i personally think keynsham holds up very well without it we would not have you done my brain in mr slater parrot the definitive look at me i am wonderful quiet talks and summer walks or sport the odd boy which would be a damn shame no matter how you slice it while this did prove to be the end of the line let us make up and be friendly notwithstanding there still seemed to be a lot of gas left in the tank,1
awesome i love this my kids have so much fun with these they are strong and hold up to ruff play they shoot water clear accross the pool,1
a look at a distant past i found it interesting it will be used in an adult ed class i will have a better idea of its uses after the class meets and discusses the poems how it reflects the times and how comfortable gabirol was in medieval spain,0
excellent translation if you follow my reviews you know that i am anglo catholic and that the NUMBER versions i use most are the good news and the original revised standard i have respect for the king james the new king james the jerusalem the english standard version and the holman christian standard i do not like the niv or the nrsv onto the subject at hand the nasb is widely praised as the most literally accurate version it does not contain the apocrypha but being that this is a protestant bible we can not really hold that against it the nasb is widely accepted in protestant churches for the most part it is carefully literal i consider it an interesting cross between the revised standard and the new king james my one slight complaint is that it is not quite as beautifully written as the revised standard but that said the new american standard is excellent,1
one of clftons great ones i love all of clifton webb films this one really extracts his serious side of acting great film of the era he is truly the one of the best actors of his time,1
pure junk so cheap and poorly made that when you use the item it cuts your finger every single time,0
poor example the homework problems like hell the examples which were given in the textbook were way too simple when you compare to the homework problems never explain how to do bode plot at all i am glad i know how to do differential equations before taking the class otherwise to use the method that taught by this book i would be dead they never explain well on those differential equations and the concept behind,0
misleading title a book with a heavily religious slant anyone expecting a scientific discussion of sexual addiction should be prepared to read that god has responded to the arrogance of the human heart by turning people over to the control of their evil desires,0
propaganda as a psychologist specializing in the field of sexual health i am utterly shocked and dismayed at this book for those suffering from sexual addiction or for their partners who are looking for some peace please do not invest in this propaganda this book is not based on the science of either psychology or sexual health and is nothing more than the worst aspect of religious dogma and will ultimately result in further suffering this type of hate mongering intolerant uneducated mindset is what has led to many of history most devastating atrocities done in the name of god a basic ethic of psychology and counseling is that that counselor or professional does not impose his or her own values upon their patients shame on you for writing such a book and calling yourself a counselor you are an embarrassment to those of us who have dedicated our lives to trying to relieve human suffering,0
excellent information this book was suggested to me by a counselor i was seeing to help me deal with the fallout of my husbands confession of sexual addiction we both read the book and it truly helped both of us to understand some of the underlying issues associated with this addiction there is so much information in this book and i would highly reccomend it to anyone facing this kind of situation,1
great concert bad dvd i have had this concert on vhs for almost NUMBER years and have been waiting for the dvd i just purchased this today and to my surprise it seems like the picture and audio are not in sync the sound and picture are about a second off from each other did anyone else encounter this problem or did i just get a bad dvd,0
great deal on a fine subwoofer i recently replaced my NUMBER year old velodyne fsr NUMBER with the dd NUMBER i did so because the fsr NUMBER was struggling in our new house with larger great room and because the dd NUMBER was on sale due to its being replaced soon by the dd NUMBER plus at considerably higher price the dd NUMBER is cruising in our new house it really provides the bottom end that my klipsch heresies can not and it does not run out of steam at high volume like the fsr NUMBER did i am mainly a music guy not so much into home theatre the dd NUMBER brings music to life and makes the singers and instruments seem to be in the room with you everything you need is included and the calibration software is a snap to use the cabinetry is first rate i got the cherry finish and although i can not tell if it is really cherry i would not bet money against it it looks that good i am quite pleased with velodyne as a company and i love my dd NUMBER,1
this book is not for nxt it a great book but the mindstorms microproessor is now nxt it has been updated until this book is updated you be better off to find a good book which is based on the nxt system,0
practical guide when making this challenging decision no one can tell you what the experience of changing churches is like unless they have been there this book is presented with wise counsel from ministers who have been there much of the advice you receive first hand on this subject is less than adequate because it is not thorough when you study all of these essays together they are sincere simple and complete this is a must read for those who are stuggling with the choice to move the one knock i would make on the book is that sometimes it is not time to move and the book says very little about when to stay where you are more detail should be given to the decision making process,1
excelente tego es la fuerza en la musica latina es una tremenda mezcla de son salsa reggaeton y hip hop que estupendo,1
definitely the best horror suspense book i know since you open the book you can not close it you have to go through to dive in the horror in the thrill in the lush stephen king fans please find disturb not the dream by paula trachtman and read it once read it twice then give it to your friends this is the real thing it is a must,1
why this is a terrific recording rob brown is simply one of the most interesting alto saxophonists playing today a keening strident tone with an attack that is relentless he takes his time building momentum and surprises with twists and turns but never loses his footing when you play this recording it is difficult to do anything else but listen it is that captivating lou grassi and wilbur morris do not just sit in the back seat for this ride they compliment the leader and provide idiomatic support all the way through it is an amazing ride and one that i will continue returning to rob brown is one of a small handful of players who always provides the goods all of his efforts are worth investigating if you can find this one it a real jewel,1
chuck this a good movie in the same vain as most of chuck norris films plenty of action a must have for your collection,1
memory lane i saw the movie based on this book when it came out in the NUMBER and i recommended it to my daughter when we found that it is virtually impossible to get a copy of the movie it never came out on dvd and i no longer own a vhs player i explored the option of reading the book i was intrigued when i realized that the book was written in the NUMBER a bit of a cultural leap from the NUMBER when the movie was produced so i decided to give it a read although i did not grow up in the priveleged classes of manhattan i was a teenager throughout the NUMBER and i could relate to the times it seemed a little milder in some respects from what i remember of the movie and my memory is not the greatest but it was a thoroughly enjoyable read,1
love these little smoker bisquettes i love the bradley smoker and these little bisquettes it uses it is so easy to use we have used the mesquite and pork and chicken it all turned out great,1
the best kept secret anti aging creams on the planet have been using exuviance products for many years they are the best its too bad they are not widely known everyone would look a lot younger exuviance should be advertising their products,1
does not fit my situation my fault i received it ok but it just does not work on my water heater i must not have checked it enough it was a bad impulse buy for me,0
one of the best romances i have read this is the first book from candice porter i have read and i can not wait to begin reading her other novels from the minute i read the first page i knew that this book would be original and hard to put down the characters are believable and ms proctor writing is so detailed that you feel you are there with them throughout the book i would definitely recommend this book you will not be sorry that you bought it,1
underrated album i almost did not buy this album after hearing some of the two star reviews from the others but i took a chance on it and i give it NUMBER stars put it where you want it is excellent both in track one and the jamming version on track NUMBER and roll with it is also excellent there no question that it hard to beat some of larry finest songs my personal favorite is smiles and smiles to go and it hard to beat his old album discovery but if you are a larry carlton fan i think NUMBER stars is about right for this one,1
lo mejor del cine espa ol esta pelicula es una de las mejores que e visto alex se luce dando una clase de road movie con gore al por mayor esta pelicula no es apta para personas sensibles esta al nivel de asesinos por naturaleza de oliver stone,1
well made but extremely skewed this bbc produced docudrama displays its roots the british apparently can not get beyond the fact that wernher von braun was the mastermind behind the v NUMBER program i can not say i blame them that human nature but it must be factored in by viewers who are not fully aware of the facts after watching this program an uninformed viewer would be left with the impression that virtually everyone working on the american program was morally intellectually and patriotically inferior to their russian counterparts viewers will probably enjoy the drama but should take it cum grano salis,0
well worth watching the space race was not quite as one sided as one might believe this series outlines the benefits of capitalism over communism but also shows serious flaws in nasa work to get man to the moon before this decade is out,1
not one of rinaldi masterpiecies yet not so bad well to be really honest with you i did not like this book personally i though ann rinaldi could have done a little better some parts are interesting and maybe even suspensful but the rest is kind of dull at some points in the book emily the main character is lying so much to her uncle valentine and is being so selfish it like okay so when she going to tell the truth or at least realize what she has done,0
this was not one of her best books yet not a failure this book is really exciting from the first chapter only i am going to be honest with you because if i raved about how wonderful and exciting this book was it would be a lie it was written with appropreate remarks and english grammer but sometimes storys just do not get you in the heart this perticular one did not but there are her other books which i would say are a masterpiece,0
an aquaintance with darkness this book was an absolute joy to read it immersed you into the characters you felt totally attached to them it let me in to a new aspect of the civil war that i had never seen before it was interesting and definitely not boring this book is what i call a people y book she forms the characters so that they seem like real people with real problems,1
excellent this was the first book i had read by ann rinaldi and i loved it i have read many other books by her since then at first i thought i would not like this book because it takes place over NUMBER years ago but i was wrong rinaldi draws you into the book the main character emily is very likable she not perfect she has some flaws like when she thinks her problem with her uncle is worse then when her friend mother is arrested and may be put to death the novel is also very historically accurate before i never knew grave robbing had been a problem in the NUMBER i highly reccomend this book,1
a story based on a song as soon as i had read the first few sentences of the review i immediately knew that the author had based this story on a song by loreena mckennitt called the highway man from her NUMBER cd book of secrets since ms mckennitt is on of my favorite composers i had to read the book unfortunately the book did not do justice to the song or the woman who wrote the song did the author have permission to write this i am sorry but listening to the song is preferable,0
well we could not get yoko kanno so here yoko ono instead what can i say this cd is pretty much everything the other cowboy bebop cd are not it pretty much either NUMBER take a perfectly good track and ruin it by throwing a lot of drums on top vibert or NUMBER as far as i can tell calling a mediocre lifeless piece of electronic pap by the same name as a totally dissimilar but good track off another cd NUMBER hero either way the originals far outshine any of the pointless meddling done on this cd on the does does not include vitaminless topic i got this album by mistake i ordered vitaminless but what i got was a double cd of this and vitaminless i can not imagine a more mistaken pairing,0

comprehensive guide to ski touring in the tahoe ares my copy of this book is nearly destroyed from all the use it receives this book is not just for winter many of the tours described have also turned out to be excellent mountain bike routes and hiking trips the descriptions of the areas the routes traverse could be expanded but the route information itself is first class,1

math made easy this product was just how i remembered it when i used it NUMBER years ago yes the answers are hard to see until you press down real hard but that is how it was NUMBER years ago and i did not expect anything different i would recommend this product to anyone trying to teach their kids addition and subtraction my children look at it like a computer and love playing with it it gives them instant answers when they press down and they like that satisfaction,1
average book the book was not as great as the reviews said it was the explanation on many of the topics was sketchy and did not have the detail i expected e g awt it probably a better book if you already know java and are looking to catch some of the finer points i do not recommend it for absolute beginners,0
some one has an ego problem i previously wrote a scathing review of this bad book and i was quite annoyed to find that some one posing to be me michael g from passaic nj said that i was mistaken for my previous diatribe of the book i am not sure who it was obviously someone figured that i was not going to read the reviews again i am not sure who it was i still maintain that the beek is bad it seems that some one is trying to sell this at all costs this makes me very suspicious of all amazon reviews sorry mg,0
legend or the truth the hound of the baskervilles is a true mystery classic by sir arthur conan doyle it tells of sherlock holmes and his trusty comrade dr john watson this extraordinary pair has solved dozens of mysteries times before but now come to their most difficult case years ago hugo baskerville was killed by a monstrous hound this curse of the hound has haunted all the baskervilles who come to live at the baskerville hall sir charles goes to live there but soon is found dead scared to death his only relative sir henry baskerville goes to live at baskerville hall accompanied by holmes and watson all along the way they are left mysterious clues that eventually help them unlock the killer i really liked this classic who dun it because around every corner was a twist it kept you guessing until the end and was really upbeat,1
for this particular edition seeing as how series NUMBER of sherlock has yet to make it to the united states i was hoping that this would be the script or at least an adaptation of the script to a novel format sadly this was not the case i confess that i fail to see how this series of bbc books distinguishes itself from the other often free editions much less the compilations available in the kindle store there is a new introduction by a member of the bbc sherlock staff and company but that scarcely justifies the cost the text itself is the standard text by sir arthur conan doyle which speaks for itself,0
a sherlock holmes story starring dr watson well you do not get much of holmes in this story and many folks either neglect to mention that or just do not notice i figure they do not notice because it such a darn good read at first it talk talk talk but the restlessness left me with oncoming chapters and i became engrossed read it,1
do not waste your time on this edition as other reviewers have pointed out this particular kindle version is broken any passages in the original which appeared in italic type have failed to be transcribed leaving large gaps in the narrative especially at the beginning therefore i rate this edition one star,0
missing text this review is not on the quality of the story i love this book however this edition is missing text whenever character reads out of a newspaper or other document the entire txt of that newspaper or document is missing from this kindle edition i have no idea which version to spend the dollar on to get the complete text but its frustating as this was my first download,0
plastic limitations when i got the product and opened the box the literature said that you can not use the kind of shower head that has a valve that turns off the flow this is because the filter housing is plastic and is subject to cracking or bursting if you turn off the flow downstream from the filter that the kind of shower head i have and i like to use the valve feature i really really wish that egeneralmedical had said this in their limited online literature and they expect me to pay the return shipping and a NUMBER restocking fee,0
great john wayne movie yooooooooooooo its a strange size for my tv but its a NUMBER movie so its exceptional i have wanted this movie for years so i bought it,1

rad or as they say in dutch heel goed i love holland and the dutch language and my dutch penpal sent me a tape with various dutch artists i love dromen zijn bedrog which is a mix of sort of modern NUMBER s music techno and a chorus in the background fast and energetic i do not recall the other songs too well but this album is awesome go dutch,1
one of the most awesome books i have ever read john bunyan pilgrim progress has to be one of the most captivating books ever written this book should be required reading in today school system from the verybeginning mr bunyan spins the tale of a journey that is most fantastic thur perils unbeliveable he somehow overcomes tremendous odds ofcompleting it but yet he does andthe rewards are magnificent a mustfor anyone born again,1

best unknown artist what a great voice and masterful delivery of material someone else wrote sexy with a capitol s but that is insufficient i am not a big jazz fan and i guess this is not classic jazz but some sub genre that really turns me on somehow the instrumentation which is good fades into the backround because christy voice is so present and distinctive i can not tell you how many times i have played this cd and chosen it over my favorite classic rock its a great album to enjoy when you are happy just being by yourself and also a very nice listen when you are with someone special i am so glad i found some other music by her and i surely hope there is more comming by the way it has a couple of cuts that do not feature her and they are interesting and do not detract from the album also i read in one of her bios that she starred in an indie movie called pants on fire you can bet i will be watching that if i can locate it,1
not as good as the other album i was excited to get my steppin album because i loved the other album of christy baron i thought about you however i was a bit disapointed beacause it was so inferior compared to i thought about you i was expecting more of christy baron sultry renditions of real accoustic jazz but what i got was some sort of a synthesized versions it still a good album but it nothing like the other one if you can only buy one album of christy baron do not get this one,0
in a word painful neither paltrow nor beckinsale were perfect either but this one was appalling this movie is packaged in NUMBER cassettes and i could not even make it through the first one where do i begin the hair was awful especially mr elton the casting was awful jeremy northam will always be mr knightley to me the costumes were awful zippers anyone i hung in as long as i could to see what they did with frank churchill but i just could not go on so sad my feeling about a good adaptation is that it should make you want to run out and buy the book i am glad i already read emma NUMBER or NUMBER times because this movie certainly would not have made me desperate to read the book i probably would have run screaming in the other direction i did like their take on mr woodhouse though thank goodness for small favors,0

marlon brando a good but slow performance by brando the girl should be in future films mature only,1
horrible brando is my favorite actor and he known for taking on anyrole and doing a great job he did a great job on this film too but he should have walked away from this one i am an admirer of off the edge movies and themes that are hard to take however this film leaves the viewerwith only one thought bertolucci is a filthy lecherous old man i rarely hate a movie but this bankrupt purely perverted film is just awful hope brando made a lot of money at least,0
well made but depressing this is another artistic movie the acting was very convincing and all the stuff they say about the powerful acting of marlon brando and the convincing youth and innocence of the one hit wonder girl that starred with him is valid it was worth watching but probably not worth owning it ultimately very depressing and does not really leave you holding on to anything the sex scenes were pretty explicit but not really anything you could not see in a r movie today buy it for the acting not the story,1
useless the dvd will not play it goes thru the process of downloading until the last point then says that it is not programed for downloading i would like to send it back for a dvd that will play,0
another great book in the series i really love this book just as much as the two before it i just do not want the series to end because i am enjoying it so much,1
the single creepiest film of the year at the risk of repeating what all the other reviewers have stated let me just say that this was as finely crafted a scarfest since the first alien film writer director neil marshall is to be commended for creating a first rate horror film that for once does not rely on all the hacneyed tricks and cgi effects that have come down the pike in the last several years as well as utilizing cast of unknowns who also can not act to save their lives this cast of unknowns are all good actors and handle their roles admirably the score by david julyan is the perfect accompaniment to marshall film and the cinematography and editing by sam mccurdy and jon harris respectively combine to make this the true jewel of horror films i normally do not purchase films of this ilk but after renting the film and getting the bejesus scared out of me i just had to own a copy i would therefore recommend this film to anyone who enjoy their shocks and frights at high octane levels,1
very bad movie this is a lame and completely unbelievable movie straight from the NUMBER s type phony monsters a group of women decide to spelunk with no flight plan filed with anyone then of course one of them chooses to take the rest into an unexplored cave without mentioning to the others that it could be is dangerous with friends like that then of course in the cave blind monsters people in rubber suits show up to murder all the women first of all why would such strong fearless women in the beginning of the movie suddenly turn into cringing screaming and hysterical stereotypes secondly the monsters are so badly done that one expects to see zippers on the back of their rubber suits steer clear of this movie it is horrible i was embarrassed for the filmmakers,0
awful waste of money this tape should be sold as an audio only the cave scenes are so dark it is pointless to watch the direction is poor character development does not exist it is too bad the rating system does not have a choice of zero or negative stars,0
movie was a waste of money this movie totally sucks i only spent NUMBER dollars on it and i still think i wasted my money the monsters were so fake and it took like an hour before anything happened the only cool part was at the begining when that guy died from that pole thats it the movie sucked do not buy it,0
trash i wish i could give it no stars i love horror movies but this is really a horrible movie the gore looks fake and a lot of it appears to be cg although some real props were used the actresses were very bad at acting and not in that cool b horror movie way either they suck i know tons of gore fans like myself may like this movie but its trash the only good thing about this movie is that it is only NUMBER minutes long guess i will start having to go back to the asian import shop for good horror,0
over rated had been given such a write up on this disappointing to say the least no shocks highly predictable and with a theme that has been done to death,0
this book is great i used this book for an entomology class at my college and i think it is great wanting to be an entomologist and knowing a lot of information about the subject already i still did not find it boring or tedious and people who know nothing about insects can understand it pretty easily too i highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in entomology and what the subject entails,1
presto chango magic is fun we are dead i saw this when i was NUMBER years old and it freaked the shiznit out of me low on gore high on psychological thrils magic is an old school horror flick of the classic kind anchored by anthony hopkin early bravura dual performance as corky fats but what i remember most about magic is not the movie but the scary as hell tv spots that used to run back in the NUMBER s on late night tv the bonus materials explain that after the simple yet very creepy tv ads ran once on tv in new york they were pulled due to parental complaints about frightening their little tots they are were not far of the mark as the camera pulls in and fats intones his evil poem magic is fun we are dead you will feel your blood turn to ice a nice dvd to complete your horror collection,1
creepy old anthony hopkins film magic stars anthony hopkins long before silence of the lambs his character corky is a magician who can not seem to catch a break he decides to try his luck at using a ventriloquist doll during his act and he becomes a success his ventriloquist partner fats starts to take over corky thoughts and motives the success that his act has brought him starts to push him further into insanity and he runs off to escape with fats it is at this point that corky weird life begins to fall apart he finds his long lost love and her violent drunk husband when fats decides to take over i remember seeing this movie as a kid and it really scared me just the thought of a doll coming to life is a bit disturbing great movie,1
harassing bears cole is in the news for all the wrong reasons photographer bear advocate cited for getting too close to bruins by scott mcmillion bozeman daily chronicle NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER cole has been cited for harassing bear in yellowstone national park he has not had his day in court yet but you have got to wonder it easy to get close up photos of grizzly brown bears at designated and well managed bear viewing areas in alaska and canada to get publishable photos of grizzly bears in yellowstone or glacier you have got to get so close you put yourself in danger and run the risk of driving the bears away from food they need or a place they want to be grizzlies are a threatened species in the lower NUMBER states why bother them when you can get photographs of grizzlies in alaska without stressing the bears what kind of bear advocate would do that,0
the best book for ap spanish this book is the absolute best buy for ap spanish language preparation it goes through every aspect of the test and has a very thorough review of all grammar tested in the exam although i thought that they had a little more then what was needed the practice tests accurately measure with the difficulty and format of the real test having a bad situation with an inexperienced teacher i picked up this book and used it for self study it helped me greatly and in the end i received a NUMBER just by going through it myself and practicing,1
great lil printer but i bought this to replace my original hp NUMBER l laser jet after NUMBER years this seems to do a great job so far much faster downloads and clean print but beware it does not come with a usb cord to connect so if the printer your replacing has the old stle connecter as mine did be ready to spend another NUMBER NUMBER for a usb cord that is why i gave it NUMBER instead of NUMBER stars,1
good printer i have bought this printer for my personal use at home it is good and reliable printer for the price somehow it arrived with software instalation cd in a forein language which was a big inconvenience the white color chose by manufacturer is a questionable it is a white spot in a room and i bet for many households it can be a problem also lack of any controls buttons is inconvenient to restart a job even after paper reload,1
a quiet workhorse bought this and just to test if i would keep it i printed a huge database file of NUMBER NUMBER pages which took me almost NUMBER hours between personal breaks and only five cartridges the guide says do not do that but i did it and this NUMBER printer did not fail once wow needless to say i kept it,1
great printer unless you are using vista i like this printer a lot and would probably have given it NUMBER stars but it gets a major demerit thanks to the fact that it does not work with computers running vista hp will not be releasing the drivers until july of this year so if you want to print now and not wait six months and you have already upgraded to vista i recommend getting a different printer hopefully hp will get the message and release some drivers vista has been in beta for a long time so i find this delay to be inexcusable,0
NUMBER printer stopped working after few months i can not beleive this printer only worked for NUMBER months i bought it last dec but only start to use it NUMBER months ago now it stopped working does anybody know this printer has any warranty thanks,0
excellent entry level laser printer if you need a home light duty printer that provides professional laser printed documents perhaps say for a small home business or a private laser printer for an executive office this is perfect it is not for huge jobs or big projects but for the little jobs that need professional flair,1
great read suspenseful when i first started reading the book i kept putting it down it just was not grabbing my attention but once i got further into the book my curiosity got the best of me i could not put the book down i could not believe that a woman would do the things that she did adrian jenkins was confused and deceitful all hell does break loose gregory relationship with his mother was sad i understand her point for leaving but at the same time it was selfish it not only destroyed gregory but it also destroyed his little sister i am definately looking forward to her next book,1
classic hardly ever see this movie on tv so i had to order love it a must see went see it at the old movie house with my school when i was a kid never forgotten it,1
what do not buy it if meth new album is not at least ten times better than this then rap is officially dead and the only thing that can resurrect it is a bone thugs reunion,0
a classic of all the albums we bought in the NUMBER s this is one of my favorites when i get in the mood for reggae i usually start here with my days be long or on marley dread it is as others have mentioned but that should not be a problem if you appreciate different styles of reggae did i forget to mention ape or augustus pablo man,1
design flaw prevents easy installation for a NUMBER NUMBER slip mount installation this diverter spout is not worth the trouble you must unscrew the diverter plastic nipple remove a plastic adapter slide it on the copper pipe screw the plastic nipple back on tighten the screw so as to punch a hole in the plastic slide the plastic nipple back toward the wall tighten the screw and then screw the spout on after applying thread tape that seems straightforward but in practice it very difficult the problem is that the plastic nipple is too small to fit NUMBER NUMBER copper pipes longer than about NUMBER from the wall the instructions say that the pipe can be up to NUMBER NUMBER long but actually this is wrong at first i struggled with trying to install it then broke the plastic when i could not force it to go all the way in i elected instead to go withmoen NUMBER bn kingsley slip fit tub diverter spout brushed nickel which simply slips in and then tightens with a screw with almost no effort,0
love old recipes thanks for compiling these recipes they were fun to read and although i am certain that i am not going to make any of them it was fun reading them,1
i want to like this the tracks are great the playing might be great the recording quality is wretched i hate to say that but it is that bad,0
shame on you mr coffee jeez i figured you guys knew about coffee this is a terrible excuse for a warmer it keeps your coffee slightly above body temperature not nearly warm enough to be pleasant i bought two of them and am tossing them out anyone considering this item do not buy one,0
great gift i was given this as a christmas gift and it more than lived up to my expectations it will not heat a cold cup of coffee but it will keep a cup at a very nice temperature for a very long time works best if you actually drink the coffee the less coffee in the cup the more effective it is a full cup of coffee left for a couple hours will moderately warm but if you actually drink the coffee slowly over time the end will still be a good temp,1
mr coffee warmer the warmer keeps the cup at an acceptable temperature and looks great on the desk the warming light is very useful in reminding me if the unit is on or off i could not be more pleased with this product and the cost was perfect,1
mr coffee mug warmer i have used a dazey and it worked great the mr coffee keeps it a little warm but i like my coffee hot,0
warm not hot this is my second coffee warmer i lost my first one a no name cheap model that worked beautifully so i bought two of the mr coffee version one for me and one for my spouse it really will not maintain the temperature of the coffee until your cup is down to about NUMBER ounce left i would not recommend this product we had the same experience with both mr coffee warmers so it was not a case of a defective item it just does not work,0
very nice product i have been using this product for a few weeks i have a ceramic tea pot that i use to make a few cups of tea at a time and the tea was getting cold way too quickly this product keeps my whole pot of tea nice and warm for as long as it takes me to drink which has been up to about six hours i am getting ready to buy a second one for my tea cup so my tea stays warm once i pour it from the tea pot,1
does not keep coffee warm purchased this in NUMBER does not keep coffee warm well barely warm but significantly cooler than i like my preference is a cup that is almost as warm as when it is first poured not crazy hot but more than lukewarm this is not even close and do not even think that it can warm up a cup that has started to cool because you have been carrying it around for a few minutes,0
mr coffee mug warmer the mr coffee mug warmer truely is a mug warmer i use it daily my mug is warm but my beverage is not,0
good heat limited space the warmer works just fine at keeping coffee warm the switch on the body of the unit is easy to locate as opposed to one on the cord the one downside is that it is too small to hold a very large mug i guess it just holds the standard size,1
works pretty well for regular sized mugs the hot plate part is not big enough to fit the starbucks city mugs so note that but a smaller mug a k a regular sized or one that does not have a wide base will fit fine i agree with other reviewers who said that it keeps drinks warm when full and hotter when less full i think the product description should specify the size mug that fits i will keep it because it works well,1
works well keeping coffee warm this works well to keep your coffee warm longer it doesnot keep hot like when it comes out of the coffee makebut it does keep it warm long enough for you to finish yourcoffee,1
awesome i am a huge tea drinker i enjoy drinking coffee but with my work i am constantly running around the office so if it was not for this warmer my coffee tea would be ice cold but this warmer really keeps it luke warm but of course the first few times there was a smell when my metallic mug is placed on the warmer but now the smell is gone,1
mr coffee mug warmer disappointed it does not keep coffee very warm i can lay my hand on the warming plate with no discomfort hope that paints the picture you need,0
worthless piece of crap this thing needs a high med low setting cause the only setting it has is low i made a cup of really nice organic japanese shade grown tea NUMBER an ounce and asked my wife to bring me an ice cube to warm it up after it had been on the heater for NUMBER minutes the pad gets pretty hot but not near hot enough to keep a cup of coffee hot after something has been sitting on it for about NUMBER NUMBER minutes you can gulp it with no fear of getting burnt a worthless piece of crap i will see if it works as a candle warmer,0
not happy with this one i have not experienced an even warm cup of tea let alone hot since using this product i tried pre heating it and still no results very disappointed i positively do not recommend this product,0
does not keep coffee hot only keeps coffee tepid at best actual element gets very hot it just does not reach the coffee item is small enough to stay on the table it makes an expensive coaster,0
disappointed i am very disappointed in the mr coffee cup warmer my coffee is really hot when i first put it on however on themr coffee mwblk mug warmerin less than an hour the coffee is luke warm i can not stand luke warm coffee so it is useless in my opinion do not waste your money why can not they make a good coffee cup warmer i am still looking,0
disappointment i was a great fan of the mr coffee mug activated warmer the ones i had finally gave out so i looked to buying more and some for friends i could find only the on off switch warmer although it was initially called mug activated on the screen so ordered NUMBER as already stated the coffee is kept only warm and you definitely have to remember to turn off the warmer or you could return hours later and find it still on which could be a danger i have been unable to find a mug activated warmer but continue the search because i do not believe this on off switch is any good,0
what a rip off three criticisms NUMBER the narrator did not explain the phenomenon of waterpocket fold NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER for ten minutes NUMBER cheesy coloration,0
westmoreland glassware review great history of the company but i was disappointed in the little milk glass content the author talks about how important the opal milk glass line was for business but does not offer much samples of it in the book,1
disappointing this is a difficult book to rate because it is strong on a few points but extremely weak on others it provides the most detailed history of westmoreland glass that i have ever seen and some of the facts are fascinating however it is very very very poorly organized photos are not always identified many items are discussed but not depicted in photo or sketch the price guide in the back uses different names descriptions than what is used in the text of the book so you can never be sure if you are checking value on the correct item i enjoyed the book but if you want to learn more about various pieces of westmoreland glass you will need to buy other books unfortunately i can not offer advice on what others because i have not found a good one yet lorainne kovar books are grossly overpriced and still do not do the job they should i would not recommend kovar books on any subject,0
not what you think if you read above it says that there are NUMBER discs on this record then you look at the top and see only two discs i expected the entire NUMBER disc collection but got only two so if this being advertised above as two and it says NUMBER down below shouldnt this be corrected or is this a case of false advertising,0
truly boring this book was a waste of my time i bought the bundle and now i am not going to bother reading any more of ms cruise ghastly stories the dialogue was atrocious and not at all amusing not once did i even crack a smile let alone laugh out loud and the plot was so neatly wrapped up that it underscored its decided lack of depth agree with another reviewer if you want mystery and romance read janet evanovich,0
highly recommended this is an awesome cd done by derryl perry higly recommend it most of the song he wrote and some collaborated with other songwriters like him outstanding vocals and musician plus songwriter,1
holes drilled incorrectly aside from missing a few bolts i also found that the holes in the seat are drilled incorrectly i will have to drill my own holes to remedy this problem this is as far as i have gotten in the assembly as i have ran out of daylight i am sure when it is finally together it will be a NUMBER NUMBER bench as opposed to my current NUMBER NUMBER rating the shipping went well as it got here on time,0
stats class workbook the workbook was missing the key software that will be required in the course very unhappy i wrote customer services and was not offered the missing software but only to send it back i need the workbook for my class and the class is in its fourth week i have since ordered the software from the manufacturer jim mcshane,0
too bad galbraith is not much of an economist galbraith is a very clear writer he rarely uses technical jargon or mathematics but unlike some other popular writers it is not because he is able to explain complex phenomena without them he does not appear to understand them this book reads like a fairy tale or child letter to santa claus mr galbraith does not seem to understand economics well enough to pass economics NUMBER but he does have an excellent command of the english language,0
smallville season NUMBER amazon beware of dvd wrong region number please beware that this dvd that i purchased for use in the uk is the wrong region number it was sold to me who live currently in the uk but it only works in region NUMBER dvd players which made me really unhappy to know that to watch it i need to change settings of my dvd player but it has to be watched at once because i will not be able to change settings again and again as the appliance can malfunction after that the return policy should cover this type of problem and refund NUMBER in those cases it was not advertised that it would be a problem to play it in the uk which was really not a good sign all customers have the right to know exactly what they are paying for i am disapointed with amazon and this company for letting that happen,0
justice league done right finally smallville is a very unique take on the legendary man of steel but it is pretty much the same when it comes to using the two most popular icons in dc comics use superman and batman to promote other dc comics charactors but in this show it works to a point all i would say is that these last seasons of smallville have gotten justice league right and justice league was done right in thses last seasons of smallville it is a shame that the animated series that calls itself justice league was not more like this this show gets it right the way justice league should have been,1
smallville season NUMBER rocks there are some folks who dislike season NUMBER but that just because they still want to see clark as that farm boy from smallville yet they do not realized that clark is no longer the farm boy that we all love but a news reporter who is embracing his destiny as the future superman yes i still miss the kent farm the talon the torch and even smallville high school but we must move on in season NUMBER clark is one step closer in being superman but he must first deal with his own personal issues including his new love for lois i love seeing new heroes on the show including stargirl and hawkman will not spoil more but season NUMBER is far the best,1
smallville so far i am a big fan of this show a big super man fan even more and everything theyve done could not have seen it done any other way i am not a big comic book person mom never let me collect them but what i do know is the original movies are good but the stories were nowhere compared to this show the new movie i did not like at all but i hear that lana has her own comic so i think it was important to keep her on the show for as long as they did i am anxious to get the louis and clarke mess rolling cause u know theres going to be lots of laughs and i hope they keep this show going for along time even if they have a bad season or two bc NUMBER many shows r getting cancelled for the reason that people who rate good shows bad bring them down so i hope it keeps going like its going so we can keep enjoying this great show bc it hs great story lines good characters and so far a good record knock on wood,1
smallville season NUMBER needs to be better packaged it came with the case broken and two discs will not play all the way through,0
mesmerizing marlene if anyone else but marlene dietrich had played the lead in this film the film would have been awful dietrich triumphs in a role no one would have predicted mysterious mesmerizing seductive funny and finally moving as the loyal gypsy lyddia dietrich makes you overlook the films flaws at times the film drags by some supporting players seem to have cotton in their mouths as they speak and some of the dialogue is inane through it all dietrich is the soul of this movie holding it all together in spite of the flaws to make the whole thing work worth watching as a romantic piece of hollywood escapism and for seeing dietrich as the fine actress she is,1
why in the world did they choose full screen this is one of my favorite movies i own the lasedisc on widescreen i could not wait for the dvd i can not understand their decision to release this gem of a movie in the full screen version only what a shame,1
pan and scan no thanks rats i was all ready to buy this movie but the ephemistic full screen format i e pan and scan stopped me cold the reason i bought a dvd player in the first place besides the great running commentaries included with many movies is so i could see the entire image the director intended not some cropped NUMBER NUMBER editted for television version call me a purist but i just do not buy cropped dvds like this one,0
blu ray would not play i have a toshiba blu ray player that a year old and this blu ray dvd would not play in my player because it so new and apparently a NUMBER year old blu ray player needs an upgrade that costs NUMBER so now i am reluctant to buy blu rays i regret getting a blu ray player at all now i gave this dvd to a friend and i am sure it fine so just do not get it unless you have a new blu ray player,0
love this movie great movie lots of fun i rent it every year so i bought it it a light movie with a great cast it reminds me of home,1
good dvd this dvd is a good show it is good to see dvds still widely availible dvd is able to have true stereo and or sourround sound,1
why is this not letterboxed i have rated the dvd the lowest possible rating although i would give the movie the highest rating who makes these decisions regarding full screen versus letterbox with the advent of dvd there is no excuse for us to miss the incredible cinematography in all it new york glory i absolutely refuse to buy my own copy of this movie until it is reissued remastered and includes some serious extras this is one of the greatest romantic comedies of all time,0
fullness balance and challenge as if attending a crusade event in person the reader will find the always compassionate passionate and caring billy graham pleading for unbelievers to believe believers to come to the fullness promised to them as children of god and for those needing clarity on this important subject to hit the book and discover through the holy spirit what they need as i read i kept thinking i miss dr graham then i turned on the tv and one of his classic crusade presentations was on a religious channel you sometimes forget what a great teacher preacher evangelist and pastor he was great great book that will bless challenge and inspire you to reach higher in your walk with the lord,1
not for introductory food the aap says not to make your own green beans spinach squash etc due to the higher levels of nitrates so i thought this product would be great to introduce green beans to my NUMBER month old the product contains fish oil so it is not a suitable candidate for a NUMBER month old or an introductory food for any age it is also not returnable while the amazon site lists the product ingredients as green beans and water only the picture of the product says with dha the dha comes from fish oil after contacting amazon to clear up the fact that this was not the product i thought i was ordering they refunded my money they offered to send out a new replacement item but i think i would get the same mislabeled product while i was not happy about the trouble this mislabeling caused i think amazon customer service did a great job,0
not my favorite diapers but still great i prefer swaddlers to baby dry during the day but they are hard to find in bigger sizes these baby dry pampers will hold a lot my son sleeps NUMBER to NUMBER hours a night NUMBER months old and the diaper lasts all night without every leaking these big packs from amazon are fantastic too the price is less per diaper than from and even sam club plus amazon does free two day shipping on diapers right now i won a free year of amazon prime for one of my diaper orders too can not beat that,1
auto delivery i created an account to have diapers delivered to my daughter house having twins her life is busy enough free shipping can not beat it love this idea,1
does not keep your baby dry so i bought these diapers because i have used the swaddlers before with success my daughter is NUMBER weeks old NUMBER pounds and uses size NUMBER for anyone that has not used swaddlers the difference between the two is clearly the quality as the diaper is much thinner almost paper thin upon the first use of this diaper i noticed that after a NUMBER hour nap my daughter onesie was was wet i gave the diaper another chance and had exactly the same issue i would not recommend this diaper as i believe the whole purpose of a diaper is to keep the baby dry,0
good diaper these are good diapers that do not leak even with overnight soakings they do not hold up to blowouts as well as huggies little movers however,1
great diapers pampers and huggies are in our opinion the best diaper brands out there we have a slightly preference for pampers because they look less bulky on the baby compared to huggies or store brands and it is the best deal i have for diapers considering the NUMBER discount from amazon subscribe save program however i have noticed that the diaper is no longer available as a subscribe save item so i am not sure whether i would buy it for the full price i would have to compared unit costs using my spreadsheet to see if it is worth it,1
they leak use swaddlers pampers baby dry is a huge misnomer they are terrible for urine intake if your baby sleeps on their tummy through the night you will wake up with a wet baby and wet sheets everything use pampers swaddlers at least until after size NUMBER as that is the largest size swaddlers they make for some reason you can thank me later baby dry wet baby,0
leaks at the kid belly leaks at my kid belly especially during his sleep or nap which is totally unacceptable pampers swaddlers huggies and even costco kirkland signature do not have this issue this diaper is good for daytime only we bought huggies for night time or naps very disappointing,0
best diapers ever well we never had any issues with pampers brand of diapers we have tried all other brands cheaper expensive ones and nothing comes close to diapers,1
best diapers ever from testing all kind of brands from every store possible pampers baby dry is far most the best out there,1
i loved this item i loved this item but i going to move out of the country so i had to cancel my baby never had problem with these diapers thanks,1
best for the price not as soft as pampers swaddler but i prefer them to the regular huggies and like them equally as the huggies little snugglers which are much more expensive very absorbent never got a leak with them and my baby sleeps for NUMBER hours at night,1
good price no wetness strip do not get confused here this is not a swaddler style diaper there is no i repeat no wetness strip this diaper came up when we searched for swaddler and its our mistake for not reading closer the diaper is a bit small in size compared to the swaddler ones and the lack of wetness strip makes it an easy NUMBER nd place choice to the same size pamper swaddler,1
were not so great we did not like these at all i am a big fan of swaddlers and these are nothing like the soft meshy swaddlers these are crunchy and thin like store brand diapers with swaddlers i could easily let my NUMBER month old go overnight without a diaper change but these leaked all over the front of me when i picked him up in the morning hated them,0
new and improved with sagging technology it takes a lot for me to dislike a product but these are terrible after a half hour the diaper would sag and look like it was extremely wet when in reality there was hardly anything in it they do not seem to hold much before leaking even doubling the diapers for overnight still does not prevent leakage definitely not something i will ever purchase again no matter how good the price is,0
stick with the pampers swaddlers my almost NUMBER month old has never had any diaper other than a pampers diaper on his body i swear by pampers but even though they are less expensive the baby dry type are not worth it i found them cheap looking and feeling they could have been mistaken for a store brand the absorbancy in the seat of the diaper was so bad my son would wake up from a short nap and the seat of his outfit would be wet there was not a fit issue he was the correct weight for the size i bought and the leakage was not from the top of the back or sides of the diaper but literally from the seat from now on i will definitely stick with the pampers swaddlers type,0
horrible diapers i bought these diapers after using the pampers swaddlers and these are the worst diapers ever the smell of urine seeps through the diapers also they do not absorb at all not worth the savings,0
best for the price there are less expensive diapers out there but i found that pampers and huggies might be more money but are the better diaper too i also found that baby dry diapers were the least expensive of the diapers that work i have a girl and they work great i really do not even price check anymore i just get these using amazon mom and subscribe and save and get them as cheap as i can i lot easier shopping for diapers when you have your favorite and these are definitely my favorite edit october NUMBER i now have another baby girl i decided to give luvs a try again and like them this time around i did not like them with my first daughter not sure if my opinion changed or if luvs changed their diaper up there is definitely a different feel than other brands but after amazon mom ended i started shopping again and now i get luvs from sam club,1
no we liked the swaddlers now that my daughter is older we needed protection and switched to huggies snug and dry,0
baby dry but covered with poop after hitting the end of the line with pampers swaddlers which max out in a size NUMBER we figured baby dry was the logical next step every time our daughter pooped it came right up the back and on to her outfit her mother the sofa you name it she is right in the size range we will not be buying this diaper again,0
quality dropped in the last NUMBER months i have NUMBER boys and have always alternated for price between pampers and huggies both diapers have gone downhill in the last NUMBER months they have less absorbency the top of the diaper in the front constantly explodes and overnight is out of the option the strip is not as wide to catch urine it been cut down constantly waking up with both my twins soaking wet the diaper has exploded and the more generic absorbing material sticks to everything we have had to change out the sheets clothes and anything else everyday several times the diapers have ripped apart so bad they needed immediate baths from all the gel coming out i have grown more concerned that since it coming out so bad it coming out of the buttons of their clothes and them eating it is this a ploy to get people into buying the almost NUMBER times more expensive overnights i do not know but they certainly are not what they have been for the last NUMBER years,0
worst ever these daipers are no good to use always leaks and gives diaper rash not worth the money pampers swaddlers are much better than these daipers,0
there is a reason for cheaper price baby dry was okay until my daughter poop got bigger it leaks we even have to change her pants and bodysuits everyday i was very frustrated then i changed to pampers cruisers with dry max which is a little bit expensive than this one it worked perfectly no leaking and no washing of clothes any more but if your baby is not a big eater as my daughter baby dry was okay you just have to change often though,0
the softest diapers out there with the best fit ever these diapers are the best i can not say enough about them in my opinion they are much better than huggies and fit true to size i feel that huggies run really small they are also so soft i feel confident using them on my babies sensitive skin i will use these again with my next baby,1
the best but only this time pampers makes the best diapers with the most varieties for your needs however their collect points promotion is misleading by the time you save up any worthwhile points your child will have outgrown the selection also the shipping and handling fees out weigh the cost at any store dishonest and mean spirited next child will use lesser quality diapers but from a company with more integrity,1
swaddlers are better but i wish swaddlers went up to my son size he is NUMBER months old and already weighs NUMBER lbs these are good but swaddlers in bigger sizes would be ideal i have not yet tried the cruisers but based on ratings these seem to be what most prefer i have not had any problems with these excet my son outgrows them so fast each shipment i order it seems i have to go up a size love pampers products,1
keeps baby dry and no diaper rash i have tried many diapers over the years and i have found that pampers are the best they fit well provide the right amount of ventilation so our babies do not get a rash and they hold a lot of liquid my only complaint is the price they are so darn expensive,1
not as good as huggies snug dry when my son wheres pampers the poop always rides up his back i am very disappointed in these diapers and can not believe all the positive reviews i gave it NUMBER stars because it does hold in pee alright for NUMBER hours max these diapers do not perform as well as huggies snug dry,0
best fit for my baby this product is wonderful and the best fit for our baby we tried swaddlers because of a friend recommendation but our NUMBER month old got rashes within the first week of using it we switched back to baby dry and the rash was gone within NUMBER days definitely recommended by me,1
fall apart i love pampers swaddlers so i thought i try these once my baby outgrew the swaddlers while i have never had any issues with leaking i have had to throw out at least four brand new diapers so far because the the entire side where the tab tears off while i am trying to fasten the diaper i have never had this problem with swaddlers or huggies so i know it not the operator also these diapers do not seem to fit very securely they tend to sag and feel very cheap even my husband commented on that and he generally does not notice these kinds of things i have only used about NUMBER diapers from my box of NUMBER but i am sure i will have more problems with tearing what a waste,0
leaky and expensive these diapers are too expensive and leaky than other diapers usually i do not buy them because of high cost but i bought them for the first time thinking that they will be gud but they were the oppsosite they leak if you forget to change a diaper before the baby sleeps i usually use luvs diapers they are far betther than these and cheaper as well i made a great mistake thinking that if it is expensive it will be good people do not waste your money in this junk product,0
best for the these do a very very good job huggies supreme hold a bit more liquid but for the price the best you can get actually like better than the pampers cruisers and they cost less with the amount in the box one case is good for almost a month rarely leak even w a NUMBER year old at night,1
incomplete shipment the diapers were fine except my order was for NUMBER diapers and i only received NUMBER i also did not have any way of contacting the shipper to let them know that my order was incomplete,0
buy swaddlers not baby dry we got a big box of baby dry from amazon our experience is that my son clothes are soaked with just a small amount of liquid on the other hand the swaddlers take on a ton of liquid and my son stays dry as a bone and so do his clothes we are sending these back as defective and ordering more swaddlers,0
great diapers we have tried several brands of diapers and definitely prefer pampers for our son they fit him best and we very rarely have explosions this box is a great value,1
horrible diapers ever pampers baby dry size NUMBER diapers economy pack plus NUMBER counti have made a huge mistake buying these diapers i thought it is a good deal and i can save some money but when i received these pampers baby dry diapers i opened the box and i find out that all of them has a little tiny brown stain on the back since it was the first time i got these diapers i guessed it shoud have been this way so i put one on my NUMBER month and half baby girl when it comes to change her diaper i was really shocked her butt and all the diaper area was in terrible red color and she had the worst rash so far i put several pastes and cream to treat it it took almost NUMBER day to get rid of them finally she had been using this particular diaper like for NUMBER hours and for this little time it caused this terrible reaction i do not understand how can people sell such a product especially baby stuff has to be carefully examined do not repeat my mistake never buy these diapers,0
maybe this will help a lot of people are writing about the size not being accurate the size of the NUMBER s are the same as the NUMBER s but i noticed that the NUMBER s have a blue liner i am wondering if they are intended for babies who need the size of the NUMBER s with the absorbancy of the NUMBER s does anyone else know pampers does not have anything on their website,1
these are great diapers i have been using pampers baby dry diapers since zach was only a few weeks old these are the only diapers i will use on him they are soft and comfortable for him i can not say there was never an incident of a leaky diaper but i would love to meet the mom who has never had a diaper mess at one point or other lol i have tried other diapers but these seem to be the most comfy and best control against diaper accidents,1
no good the diaper is too thin that it hardly holds anything we found we literally had to change the diaper for our kid every hour interestingly the same pamper diaper we bought from local supermarket or walmart store was a lot better and could last for several hours,0
baby dry leaks we tried pampers baby dry on vacation and our had leaks at least once and up to four times per day our one year old baby is a size NUMBER and does not have any problems in swaddlers cruisers or other store brand diapers i could not believe how leaky these were,0
pampers baby dry not recommended i purchased these baby dry thinking we could step up from the pampers swaddlers i was wrong i just assumed they would be as good as the swaddlers but they are not my baby girl is NUMBER months and is an average baby not chunky or big other reviews mentioned it may have an impact on the diaper here are my con do not absorb like i need them to she is up one to two times per night and if i do not change her at one of the feedings by morning she will be in a puddle and i will have to wash everything they are not nearly as soft as swaddlers when she is really wet the inside of the diaper will come apart and stick to her it is a stringy something that sticks to her legs yuck they really are fine during the day it is at nap and night time that she seems to over flow out of the diaper i will not order another box of these i was honestly shocked that they were not better because i really love pampers oh well live and learn,0
gr NUMBER product my kid is enjoying daiper takes lot more time than other ones and still will be fresh and dry,1
not dependable we found this diaper undependable leaky and can not take an average load liquid or solid difficult to manage the night shift when his clothes and the sheets get wet prefer swaddlers any day,0
best value i already have good luck with pampers so far no complaints people who are disappointed that there is no blue line i thought it would make them like those i used to then i figured out the blue line only instead of pampers swaddlers pampers diapers in the dry i have started to buy diapers through amazon only because if you use amazon subscribe and save discount they are cheaper than you can get even at a substantial discount in membership stores,1
best diapers my little man sleeps NUMBER hours a night and these are the best diapers for leak protection if you do the amazon mom subscribe save it an even better deal than cheapo diapers with subscribe and save i get a box of these each month delivered to my door so fantastic worry free highly recommend,1
good i like the price and quantity in the package but i am noticing now that they are holding up overnight i have recently changed to a more absorbent diaper at night,0
good diapers subscribe and save rules probably my NUMBER nd favorite disposable i find them to be very reliable and they smell nice however the scent does concern me and while all disposables contain chemicals i wonder about the more so when i am using scented pampers regardless combined with subscribe and save this is a total win win the price and service can not be beat i am a part time cloth diaper user and subscribe and save has made filling in the gaps very easy i can not say enough how much i love it,1
not as good as cruisers i normally buy pampers cruisers i will not buy these again they seem really cheap plastic like i do not like the smell yuck can not wait for the jumbo pack to be done,0
pampers size NUMBER economy pack i ordered the economy pack of pampers baby dry size NUMBER and i love pampers although the size is a little small for NUMBER it was very convenient and nice sized i will order this product again,1
best diapers for us i have not really strayed from pampers since my son was born each time we borrowed a diaper from a friend or went on vacation and had to use another brand they did not work as well tabs not restickable not as absorbent etc and we went back to pampers i discovered baby dry because we were in mexico and that was the type of pampers they had in the costco there baby dry is great they are thin and super absorbent amazon is the best place to buy them especially if you use subscribe and save,1
best diapers at a great price i have looked at quite a few different places to get a good price on diapers and amazon has been the best same price as my local stores but they get delivered right to my door free shipping i calcuate the price per diaper and amazon is always the cheaper or equal to other sites local stores as for the diaper itself i love pampers brand for diapers not wipes over any other diaper brand i prefer the baby dry over the cruisers for price and quality and now that they make the baby dry with the caterpillar stretch sides they are even better they fit like a dream even on my skinny little boy my NUMBER month old son has been in pampers since the day he was born and any leaks are very very rare even overnight when he sleeping NUMBER hours i am very price aware and amazon and pampers fit my budget perfectly,1
gave a rash i bought the xl case of pampers baby dry in size NUMBER and after only NUMBER diapers my son has a horrible rash on his entire back where the diaper touches my son skin is not sensitive and we have used pampers swaddlers hugggies snugglers huggies snug n dry parents choice and comforts kroger brand and he has never had any issue now i am stuck with this xl case of diapers,0
not my favorite we used pampers sensitive swaddlers for my son but by the time he was size NUMBER they did not work the swaddlers did not have good protection and he would poop out of them we decided to try baby dry they are awful every diaper he either pees or poops out of now i am constantly washing his clothes and going through at least NUMBER outfits a day i am really not happy with baby dry i loved pampers but a friend of mine told me she had same problem with the larger sizes of pampers and had to switch to huggies,0
terrible smell and horrible rash we have been getting pampers baby dry from a wholesale club for a while now with no problems my son is NUMBER months in size NUMBER i saw the price on amazon and with the NUMBER off it was a great deal however when the box arrived the diapers smelled awful chemical like i gave them a day to air out which they did but in the next few days of using them my son has developed a terrible diaper rash he has only had tiny rashes NUMBER times in the past but this one is continuous and awful looking we are discontinuing use of these particular ones immediately and going back to the wholesale club i do not think it baby dry per se but the shipment that amazon has it really upsets me that they would offer inferior diapers at such a reduced price they need to be tossed and never touch a baby skin,0
great deal when you subscribe i recently subscribed to this product and it really does make a difference in price i recommend if you have got little pamper babies to just go ahead and subscribe to this product i saved a bit even with my first shipment happy mommy,1
gr NUMBER product gr NUMBER deal from amazon wonderful product at a great deal from amazon babies will luv them all stars i am in for repeat orders for the pampers diapers,1
awesome i save a lot of money it is better to buy in bulk like this than the small one i saved a lot of money and worry to run out of diaper anytime soon,1
good diaper this is the best diaper i have found next to the old pampers cruisers they are not as soft as i like and they do not have a liner like i want but they do not leak even after a NUMBER hour night with my heavy wetter they are more economical than the new pampers cruisers and i think probably a better diaper overall anyway,1
pampers these pampers were the worst my son was soaked every nighti switched to o overnight ones which are great no leaks,0
great loved this product for my baby i have enough diapers for her and they work so well controlling her during the night,1
not absorbant enough i liked these the best when my baby was NUMBER lbs but now at NUMBER lbs he leaks through every one of them in NUMBER hours or less the NUMBER fit a little too big and i know he almost ready but these are supposed to be good to NUMBER lbs and they are not i have almost an entire case of these that i am donating because i do not trust them size NUMBER of sam club brand is working way better than these and cost less too,0
leak with breastfeed poop up the back these diapers leek up the back when my baby poops then got to waste time and change her shirt with poop and whatever else the poop got on annoying,0
great for the price i love these diapers i have been using it for my son during the day with the discounts and and all others amazon coupons i got this for a very decent price i think NUMBER discount is very good its been almost a month and i still have half of the box to be used,1
not what the name implies my daughter was wearing the huggies prior to this i ordered this diapers thinking that they would be softer and more absorbent than the huggies to my surprise they are neither softer or more absorbent i am very disappointed and have had to change many skirts and pants because of this i am planning on writing to kimberly clark as well regarding this also these diapers run small,0
not good for night times target diapers are much better than these diapers my daughter sleeps through the night when she wakes up her dress the sheet everything will be wet this diaper is ok to use during the day times but definitely not at night,0
hyped walt whitman literary reputation has been hyped by gay critics i suspect i am not totally hostile to free verse in fact i like t s eliot the most famous proponent of this genre but whitman wrote ramblingly seemingly devoid of poetic coherence that the reader creative imagination is left unstirred i agree with robert frost the truly great american poet that writing poetry without the classic conventional rules is like playing tennis with no net,0
book review this book of poetry covers some very heavy stuff at the same time the subject matters cover a lot of matters that i have wanted to read for a while i suggest that you do not read his poetry silently say it all out loud they are meant to be read loud and proud trust me that worth it,1
rip off this edition does not contain a table of contents which makes it impossible to navigate and totally useless overall save your dollar and look elsewhere,0
a mistake a co worker gave this book to me he was more of a fan than i but whitman grew on me and over the next several months i learned to appreciate his work however i left this book above my toilet and was disturbed that a relative of mine snooped through it while taking a dump discovering secrets that this co worker and i had together i now regret ever having read this silly book and am planning on burning it,0
shameful in my opinion this dvd did not contain any worth while figure skating coverage my five year old was in tears because we could only find five second clips of actual skating to make matters worse there does not seem to be anyway to access the actual skating events even if one is willing to pay for it nor does the olympic website itself have videos of the events i could understand if we were searching the week of the olympics or even that month however it been close to a year shame on you nbc the olympics are not yours,0
did i watch the same movie ok i read the other reviews for this movie and i am a little confused was it the same movie the martial arts were ok in this but nothing i have not seen done better before the story line was ummm well nevermind oh and did i mention the film does not end i mean i did not really care but it still sucked to cut the story line half way though i really wantedto like this movie but the only good thing i can say is that some of the sub titles are hilarious,0
hybrid cd is a joke the surround sound on this disc in non existent there is no center channel on the multi channel layer if you are serious about multi channel recordings this is the worst this label should be ashamed of itself to mislead the public into thinking this is some kind of new level in recorded music,0
power off solution i have had my NUMBER mw for over a year when NUMBER st received after turning on it would work for NUMBER to NUMBER minutes and then cut off i tried removing and re pluging in the power cord and it would work for a few minutes and then the monitor would again cut off then i tried a different approach i removed the power cord and squeezed the end that goes to the monitor with regular pliars since then the monitor has not itself off once i believe that what was happening in my case anyway was the power cord connection at the monitor would heat up and expand and break the flow of ac squeezing the power cord with the pliars up the connection allowing the cord to maintain contact i looked at the monitors plug hole after removing the power cord and the connection lugs were inset into the monitor farther that i think they should be i think that that caused the problem do not know if this helps anyone else that is the only reason i do not give this monitor a NUMBER rating,1
bad power suplly i bought this NUMBER months ago i purchased a refurb unitwell about NUMBER months ago the ps started to act up NUMBER NUMBER later it working again many people have experienced this problem with the ps,0
does not adhere peels off so i tried this on a few things attaching a leather strap to a suede bag i made repairing leather sandal straps and trying to repair a shoe sole the leather strap pulled off the sandal repair came apart on vacation and the shoe sole did not adhere properly so it started to come off when i pulled on the side that was coming off it pulled off in one big chunk it seems like the glue sticks very well to itself but not to the other materials you are trying to attach and yes i followed all of the instructions to a t still looking for a better shoe leather glue,0
it sticks the glue was easy to apply my boyfriend attached it to his boots which were coming apart in some places unfortunately the spot needing to be fixed was not one that could be fixed and the fix did not stay,1
love this stuff works great for repairing soles that start to come apart it is very durable and extends the life of shoes that need minor repairs highly recommend,1
shoe goo shoe goo works great the bottom of my tennis shoe was peeling i applied some shoe goo and glued the sole back on and let it dry NUMBER hours next day the tennis shoe was good shoe goo really works for the size i should buy a smaller shoe goo,1
beginning with audrey growing up during wwii brought integrity i learned a lot about audrey hepburn childhood that i had never realized before beginning in wwii brought the story home and made it real,1
what kind of person could have done this great book for anyone interested in true crime and the criminal mind john douglas looks at some classic crime cases using his profiling method look at the facts of the crime and draw conclusions about what kind of person could have done it this is in contrast to the approach of identify a likely suspect then identify facts of the crime that fit the suspect the author does not claim to solve all of the cases he studies in this book but rather point us in the right direction for example he describes the likely personality characteristics and behavior of jack the ripper interestingly this does not seem to match patricia cornwell conclusion and the zodiac his discussion of the ramsey case is probably the most controversial since he was personally involved in the case a well written and interesting book,1
general overview of bizarre cases too obtuse for crime scholars a dummy guide to understanding bizarre murder cases i would read this if you were a new immigrant to the western world so i would look around for weightier books on a specific crime topic this book is too broad and not informative enough the reason why these cases haunt the fbi is that they need to turn on the light switch,0
fascinating read i do not typically read this kind of work but picking it up at a real bargain price it looked interesting given all the media attention this renown profiler receives his analysis of this collection of unsolved mystery murders showcases his analytical abilities honed over years of work he primarily spends a great deal of time on two key areas context of area in which crime committed and victomology from jack the ripper to jonbenet ramsey he applies all that years of working the toughest cases has brought to him one that fascinated me the most was the one i knew the least the lindbergh kidnapping the missing chisel the removed flooring all this pointing to the convicted one also that gen schwartzkopf relative was involved these cases do hold our yearning to solve mystery especially that where justice is sought and all can see if their hunches play out,1
why does not clay get played anymore had this cd years ago and it was stolen from my car along with all other music the ccm being played today can not hold a candle to this beautiful musical offering clay crosse is amazing,1
my wife loves it the stones are a bit small and not as colorful as the picture but the necklace is beautiful and well made interesting clasp with a non rolling chain nice,1
poor quality this is a very poor quality necklace i needed to take it in direct light before i could see any stones nothing like picture shown no bill in the box so sadly i am unable to return,0
really bad the product was in a very old box and the ac dc connection was just a bare wire so i did return this item,0
skipping cd my cd of cassie me and you skips throughout the cd this is the NUMBER nd time i have received a cd from amazon that has skipped this will be the last time i order any cd from amazon this is very frustrating as i feel i have spent my hard earned money on this thanks for nothing,0
if you are a difficult size in a time crunch i had to quickly find a dress to go to a wedding and i was distressed by how little i could find in my size readily available on the web or in stores amazon was the last place i looked and this is the first thing that popped up and it perfect it fits it appropriate and it cheap and fast if you are plus size and tearing your hair out over how slim the pickings are especially if you have an ounce of taste and do not like the traditional plus size color palette prints this is your solution also the only alternatives i found were all special order at least two months ahead gowns hello who does anything two months ahead any more if time is not a luxury you can afford this is your solution as well,1
in the rain or in the snow got the got the funky flow this is the soundtrack to the classic playstationgame if features all the songs from the game plus all the instrumental music cues the songs most of which are rap songs are really cute and amusing the instrumentals are similarly cutesy and almost all of them are under a minute long a few are less than ten seconds long if you are a fan of this game i am sure you will enjoy the soundtrack,1
easy to understand guide when my NUMBER year old niece was diagnosed with brain cancer last year my family was devastated her parents are both rns and so could more easily understand a lot of the terminology and treatments i have absolutely no medical background and i found this book to be very helpful this book provided comprehensive explanations of various treatments commonly used drugs different types of brain and spinal cord tumors etc that were easy for a layperson to understand i also really liked that there were many shared experiences from other families who had dealt with childhood cancer it made me feel like we were not alone there are new treatments that come out all the time so obviously some of the information may be dated but overall i thought this was an excellent guide for anyone caring for a child with brain cancer,1
not pleased i am not very pleased with this product for a couple reasons first off this product did not teach me much of the italian language which is its whole purpose secondly i felt very lost from one part to another it just seemed very unclear as to what i was always supposed to be doing my advice is to consider a competitor product before this one a good alternative product to look at would be italian now by transparent language which is very well done,0
bibleman a great video absolutely wonderful video my preschoolers love it and now go around playing bibleman the hero they shout out word power to fight bad guy this is a great improvement from playing slash and shoot them up the price was great,1
there a reason this was only on tv the original patton motion picture is a masterpiece and one of my favorite movies george c scott is a genius and one of my favorite actors i was happy to find this movie on amazon on demand but was disappointed with the movie itself looks like a low budget made for tv movie which it is casting was poor outside of george c scott these were a bunch of b or c actors richard dysart as eisenhower was particularly bad as noted in many other reviews the video quality was poor way too long and way too depressing i was hoping this movie would cover more of the postwar patton and less of george c scott lying in a hospital bed if they cut off the last third of the movie it might be four stars i recommend you pass on this movie at the very least stop watching after the accident he suffers paralyzed in a hospital bed and dies there is nothing useful after that point and there is a lot of overacting,0
excellent healthy eating book love the book has many recipes in it i have used many of them and they not only taste good but do help u feel better,1

philip k dick would be proud this film is actually four short films one film the robot fixer actually has little to do with technology or robotics as we usually perceive it lets play one of these films is not like the others while the others are very good speculative fiction pieces which make you go hmmm i thought that pak made the most use of his time and pulled the viewer into each story universe quite thoroughly after a week of working NUMBER hour days in the astrodome after the hurricane katrina survivors came in it was the perfect way to spend my first evening back with the family i highly recommend,1
defective machine do not buy i was looking for a coffee machine with a thermal caraffe at first the cofee was great then a couple of weeks later coffee started to pour directly out of the machine onto the floor i thought maybe i had a bad machine so i took it back to the store and exchanged it for a new one a month later same problem the coffee pours around the caraffe not into it i burned myself trying to clean it up and it stained my nice kitchen floors i am taking it back for a different brand coffee maker i will not be fooled three times,0
ian richardson version of the hound of the baskervilles i highly recommend this NUMBER version of the sherlock holmes mystery richardson suits the role of holmes very well bringing a confidence and intellectual flare to solving the case i can not be critical of much in this movie i enjoyed it immensely on vhs and now again on dvd it well acted well scripted and well produced i think ian richardson is my favourite sherlock holmes although i do not think he played the role as many times as other actors again he brings such confidence in his ability that as a viewer you do not really think he not going to solve the mystery thumbs up enjoy,1
supreme coltrane a wonderful and creative album great listening from start to finish belongs in every jazz library along with blue train giant steps and kind of blue,1

five stars there are not enough stars in the sky and no words i can say here that will do it justice,1
spirituality in sound supreme a love supreme was for john coltrane both an intensely personal statement and a gift to mankind on the brink of ruination due to alcohol and drug abuse coltrane had a life altering epiphany in NUMBER on the liner notes to the album he writes during the year NUMBER i experienced by the grace of god a spiritual awakening which was to lead me to a richer fuller more productive life at that time in gratitude i humbly asked to be given the means and privilege to make others happy through music a love supreme was recorded in NUMBER after the death of his friend eric dolphy and the birth of his NUMBER st son these events must have inspired coltrane to create his masterpiece outside of bach b minor mass i can not think of a greater work of pure spirituality in music whether or not you are into jazz you should listen to a love supreme at least once in your life,1
silicone case for palm treo NUMBER p i am enjoying its use the only issue is one of manufacturing the opening that allows for moving of the vibrate off on control does not align with the control it is difficult to move the control i modified the case by making a small cut to it,1
phone cover not the greatest produce i have used the product for about NUMBER weeks and just recently took it off the cover fits nicely except for the holes on the side which i had to cut bigger it attracts lots of lint from your pockets i just have not really been pleased with it but for as cheap that it was i should not really complain,0

disappointed i own another sony vcr slv n NUMBER which is nice this one was for the kids but it going back the vcr is noisy very distracting picture is fair i expect more from sony products,0
great NUMBER concept album it moody a little dark like for driving down the highway at night but that why i loved it in the NUMBER i just was never able to find the cd to me it is the most well done well produced album by tommy shaw as i have heard most of his others to date still yes it has a certain heavy keyboard NUMBER sound but it is more than his other efforts in my humble opinion so dark but great guitar it should have really been the concept for another styx album instead of the more light wieght stuff they all have done,1
complete failure this album offers absolutely nothing worth wasting time with shaw had one minor NUMBER hit with girls with guns but nothing on this one people forget that shaw only contributed one top NUMBER hit too much time on his final three albums with styx before they broke up without nugent and blades his career may have ended here,0

brill this album is a must have look for the similarities between sunny day and jane addiction in NUMBER million i swear it there every track is incredible be warned that listening to it in already sad states will lead to probably more sadness but it good to be there sometimes,1
i hate to disagree but well i have to say that i did not really want to write a negative sunny day review but then i thought of the unfortunate lads who would waste their money on this cd instead of buying a different sunny day cd i am a big fan driving NUMBER hours to see them play in a couple weeks but i was kinda let down by this one diary and self titled are strongly recommended,0
a great disappointment a am a huge sdre fan but to tell you the truth their new cd was not all that good their old stuff was way better sdre has lost their style and emotion this cd is not worth buying,0

author needs to take grade school writing lessons i did not say anything then because that has a very good chance of happening and there is not really any way out once uncle frank gets you except holding your breath for a really really long time which might spoil the day for everyone else even though the ambulance would come and i would get to ride inside it while they saved my life verbatim quote of the author writing abilities i myself had a hard time trying to understand some of these sentences imagine my first grader annoyance run on sentences mixed verb tense missing punctuation you name it the book should be called bad writing lessons the editor must have been out sick the day this manuscript was turned in give it to a kid you dislike to repulse them away from reading but the illustrations are nice so one star for that,0
jane is a girl with spunk my daughter sadie and i love this book the author has a real knack for writing with the voice of a young girl this girl jane is smart and funny and spunky it a great story,1
one of the most disturbing war movies ever made unfairly ignored during it initial release this movie deserves another chance unlike most war movies this film concentrates not on battles but the heinous acts of some soldiers as they kidnap a girl rape and abuse her michael j fox plays the one soldier who tries to stand up and do the right thing fox proves he got what it takes to hold his own in a serious part even better than bright lights big city and sean penn is riveting as the soldier who takes things too far i saw this in theaters in NUMBER and it left me shaken and surprisingly years later it still has not lost it impact director brian depalma who usually makes stylish gimmick loaded films does a great job here with the serious subject matter the haunting score by ennio morricone that accompanies the poor girl ordeal will stay in your mind for a very long time tough to watch but extremely worthwhile if you are looking for powerful cinema,1

swimming against the tide but an improvisation is wonderful if and this is a huge if an improvement on the original is made after listening to all NUMBER cuts i have to say that in every case the original is more enjoyable and satisfying to me to listen to can you really expect montero to improve on vivaldi that really is too much however if it is not as enjoyable as the vivaldi why would i spend money to listen to montero this revue is in no way a reflection on her pianistic abilities but it sure is a gripe about butchering classic source material my advice and it seems to be unique among reviewers so far is that if you like vivaldi listen to vivaldi not montero seeking to change vivaldi or bach or scarlatti or pachebel the original is stunning the alterations to it are just misc music,0
ho hum not much new here i listened to it for the sarah song and it is what gave it two stars not horrible but the music is generic movie soundtrack music the two versions of you got a friend in me add nothing to the song when she loved me is a nice song performed wonderfully by sarah mclachlan but not enought to spend money on this whole cd,0
amazing soundtrack this soundtrack is truly a piece of art randy newman has done some great things with this album when she loved me is a beautiful song that i can not help but listen to over and over again the instrumental part which makes up the majority of the album is exciting yet very soothing and enjoyable if you have seen the movie and paid any attention to the music at all the soundtrack is a must i put it in my cd player sit back and relax i will listen to this one for years to come,1
spirit of christmas i was not able to purchase because of mistake in pricing and advertisinig may try later the company contacted to advise of this mistake,0
the bible made easy this book takes each book of the bible and gives a background on the setting in which it was written the author puts all the information in very understandable words it does give one an understanding of the times when the writing takes place it is necessary for those who know nothing about the history of the writings of the books of the bible it is more of a reference book than an easy read it is a good book for understanding sections of the bible and explaining them to others good for rcia groups donna murphy,1
absurd plot the author is quite talented the book well written the religious history very interesting there is sufficient adventure intrigue and excitement but the central theme that many core beliefs of catholicism are at odds with the god it purports to serve that mary herself has repudiated such beliefs and that a progressive pope will shortly put an end to these beliefs is more than a stretch it devolves into an anti catholic message that is wrapped around a good yarn this is exacerbated by the depiction of high church officials as evil mafia type figures who readily engage in heinous acts including murder and extortion yes some church officials have in the past been guilty of deceit and cover ups to protect child abusers but this is a far cry from high church officials engaging in conduct rivaling that of the characters in the godfather series but if comparing the catholic church to the evil demonstrated in those movies is your cup to tea then this book is for you,0
a fine read steve berry is one of those writers you love to read from the get go you are part of the ride each one of his works is a given that it will entertain and get you thinking secret deals with the message the holy virgin gave to the children at fatima has some of the grace of angels and demons but not the wild ride of an ending although a satisfactory one definitely worth reading,1
better than the templar legacy or the amber room although berry bad guys are pretty unconflicted about being bad guys especially for priests and the reveal regarding the third secret of fatima is jarring more for its anachronistic feel than for its content this yarn is similar to dan brown angels and demons in its look at the inner workings of papal enclaves and backstage vatican politicking it starts just a bit slow but has a satisfying build up of suspense and twists so as to make it a reasonable page turner for those who will not get too hung up on the undertone of criticism for the current catholic church and its various doctrines while there are some odd character choices and a bit of inconsitency about how urgent various things are and are not along the way i found myself entertained and turning pages and after all is not that really the point of a mass market thriller donald j bingle author offorced conversion,1
very entertaining this is the first of steve berry books that i have read i liked it so much that i bought all the novels by him that i could lay my hands on from my favorite local used books store it is action packed and well researched i admit that the conclusion of the book seems a bit far fetched his depiction of the vatican intrigues do not seem very far from the truth though except perhaps for the murder parts it is the kind of novel that i find perfect to relax at the end of the day or on vacation,1
a few minutes of horror there about NUMBER minutes of horror film but the rest of the NUMBER hours is made up of NUMBER confused people trying to come to terms with their histories which are related to the horror story portion by analogy and the man brief contact with the dead children there was supposed to be a psychological reason behind the horror but it did not strike me as particularly insightful instead it was dreary the acting even by jun ji hyun was dreary the actions by the characters were dreary the only sign of life comes from the fianc e a strong dynamic performance by attractive yu seon to see jun ji hyun at her best i recommendmy sassy girl daisy oril mare,0
a hair to the right and maybe too soon strikes me as too soon to produce reliable history about a period so recent he seemed a hair right of center but at least did not fall into the mythology of reagan winning the cold war he mentions clinton as slick a couple times but in his previous NUMBER history i do not think memory may be wrong he ever used tricky dick or slippery richard about nixon,1

not up to par i have long been a fan of muriel spark truly enjoying her humor and style i liked her autobiography as well but this book is a great disappointment the characters are shallow in particular dr wolf is cardboard and scarcely believable there is a certain sense of haste events are barely sketched and it is all quickly brought to a conclusion without going into any detail a very thin book indeed which would probably have received much less attention if the author did not have such a reputation,0
zane grey i was really surprised that there was another nevada book by zane grey i had originally wanted another copy of the first book nevada but when i saw this one i just had to buy it thanks,1
good to see that fans are keeping the place clean it sad but it happens bootleg cds get put up for sale on amazon and they can not remove them fast enough i commented on two other bootleg sales and can not find them any longer obviously amazon took them down and new identical ones came and took their place some people just do not have any shame at all if you are going to call on amazon to remove these cds you should rather suggest that they blacklist the seller remove any means to buy the item and mark it as fake that way no customer would ever have to be fooled again,0
thumbs down this cd is not too bad but at the same time i wish i had not bought it i think the singer said to himself let us see how i can ruin this record by whining like a country singer all emotionally and in a realllly bad way oddly enough the absolute best song these guys ever put out is not featured on either of their cd sweet summer besides the fact that this is missing that gem of a song it nothing like the first cd nothing quite like the cathy pop rhythms of do not stop on this cd just kinda bland soft rock i recommend downloading sweet summer as it is their best song by far and perhaps possibly buying the first cd but do not waste your time on this one,0
judge a book by results i purchased this book over a year and a half ago and i have yet to win big i have studied this book from cover to cover and use it with lotto how to wheel a fortune also by gail howard anyone who considers purchasing either book should know that the majority of the jackpot winners in her testimonial section are from the late eighties in theory lottery master guide appears to offer a variety of proven systems to beat the odds but sad to say i do not feel it lives up to its claims i personally would advise you to save your money and not purchase either book,0
the guide for serious players difficult to win anything on your own outlay by individual players is too large better start a pool at the office with co workers and collect funds in order to play any of her wheeling systems you will share winnings and losses small and both sides unless you hit the jackpot no other book comes close get your rabbit foot or any other totem for luck you will need it,1

what the fascination thurber revealed the secret life of walter mitty dubar should have kept his life a secret unrevealed a lot about the drinking and useless meanderings of jules dubar written in a painfully simplistic and predictable style dubar life is not interesting except in the fact that a highly educated man so often behave so coarsely but geologists often took pride in that kind of behavior back when very macho those guys save your money or toss it in a river but avoid this book,0
not for chevy s NUMBER pickup one bushing fits the other does not i chose to make it fit will implode into itself seeing as its brass and squeak to caboose but its better than your door not shutting,0

a huge dissapointment not a complete guide i believe al ristori to be a well respected fisherman who normally shares valuable information in a cut to the chase manner but this book fails to live up to that reputation it is definitely not a complete guide to saltwater fishing almost all of the information presented in the book is cookie cutter and generic information that can easily be found on the net for free this book was clearly not a labor of love and al merely put his well know name on it to bank some coin and has disappointed me in the process,0
publisher i found the book itself to be interesting and entertaining however i attempted to write a paper about it for school but there is no publisher information or translator i do not suggest this version of the book for students planning to use it in papers,0
a good reference for basic techniques i was looking for some more advanced features than were offered but it looks like it will be helpful to me moving forward i build alot of forms in adobe acrobat if you have never done javascript in acrobat or have intermediate knowledge it may be a helpfull book for you,1
mixed up this book would have been better if the couples were switched though to tell you the truth i do not understand why bridig was even in the book she was extremely irritating brodick was also another irritating character i mean like some kind of wild caveman i liked gillian and ramsey and think they would have made a better couple this is her first book where i think she overwrote the male lead this is the first book i have read by jg that i was not crazy about but gillian ramsey ian and judith made up for the shortcoming with this one,0
a true romance one of garwood best i absolutely loved this book and could not put it down the heroine gillian was full of courage and did not back down when faced with problems laird buchanen the hero is all man but you can feel how much he cares for gillian at the same time there are NUMBER or NUMBER other storylines taking place that culminate in the resolution of gillian main problem will she get to see her sister does she find the treasure how will she get alec to his home after he is kidnapped who is the traitor to the sinclairs and more i read this book in NUMBER sittings and it left me feeling happy,1
killing your dog in the chapter on pets zahn lists euthanizing your companion as an option if fido or kitty will not take kindly ever to your baby p NUMBER this struck me as rather compassionless especially for a book about parenting she could have mentioned the possibility that some pet owners may have to find new homes for their companions and left it at that,0

wanting to be a bombshell i bought this dvd almost a year ago i finally decided to use it and i am happy that i did i did find the dvd very helpful the workouts are not long and there are some rest periods throughout each workout in my opinion workout NUMBER is the hardest i am not a fan of burpees at all but they do get easier i do not really rest during the breaks if i need a rest i take it if not i fast forward to the next section overall a great workout i will probably get her next dvd i am new to the kettlebell thing and i am using a NUMBER pound bell this seem like just the right size for a beginner,1
for beginners i have been a exercise dvd junkie for years kettlebell dvds also although i like the exercises presented i have some issues with her form i know from personal experience if you do not have your form correct you can cause injury to other parts of your body as i did with my knees also if you are advanced you will be working out without her instruction as she only does the beginner workout with you normally trainers will either let beginners know when their time is up and continue on with the advanced exercisers lisa stops working out at the beginners level which leaves you still working out by yourself hopefully finishing in time for the next exercise i did pick up some good exercises but do not use this dvd as often as i would have liked i will be sending it down the resell road,0

what what no limits on the rise again easily one of the dopest cds of the year NUMBER but it will probably get slepped on because the haters are in full effect when it comes to no limit this cd can be listened to from the begining to the end without skipping a single song the beats are excellent even without beats by the pound the new production team is holding their own you got to feel c murders maturity on this cd hes taking his game to a whole other level k blaque puttin it down for nolimitsoldiers com,1

rockin scandinavians i heard this group on the radio and had to have their cd which i like very much my only disappointment is that my favorite track sinklars vise is incomplete the singer is cut off midsentence and it was a longer song on the radio even though i can not understand the words the rhythms are mesmerizing,1

an excellent edition of sesame and lilies this is an excellent edition of john ruskin sesame and lilies the best i have found the editors have not gone footnote crazy there are fortunately few supplementary materials such as the intro chronology and glossary are well done and interesting and the critical essays included are varied and very much worth reading this ed is part of yale rethinking the western tradition series all of which are well done,1
outstanding marriott was the man and deserves to be remembered but the fact that he was one of the best r b vocalists this country ever produced means anyone trying to do his songs justice is probably with all the best intentions going to struggle steve ellis comes closest to hitting the notes the best of his tracks being song of a baker dennis greaves simon honeyboy hickling and midge ure all perform well both the tracks by deborah bonham are outstanding in particular if you think you are groovy which is easily the best thing on the album the tracks by weller gallagher mclagen et al are good but you expect better as for tony rivers ripping the throat out of itchycoo park the less said about it the better review in brief good tracks NUMBER out of NUMBER best track if you think you are groovy deborah bonham worst track itchycoo park tony rivers worth buying yes because the good tracks make up for the bad ones,1

attention history lovers for all of you that like english history with a twist of mystery than you will love the novella the daughter of time by josephine tey this is a mystery novel that deals a lot with english history and old kings and stuff whic is something that i just do not mesh with on a scale of one to ten i would have to rate this book a three the reading was a bit hard and i often found myself counting the pages until i was finished though i usually love mystery this one was definitely a disappointment on countless levels the book was written well and i think that if i had been a tad bit older and wiser on english history that i may have enjoyed it more overall i think that i would personally have to give the book two thumbs down,0
this highly surprising telling of one of the oldest mysteries in england was thoroughly enjoyable the story is told in an intelligent manner and seems to logically solve the mystery until i read another theory on these two little princes i find more believable i will stick with this one,1
well written thought provoking british mystery i have given away at least a dozen copies i do not want to spoil anyone delight in reading but i will say that the content remains controversial debby goldstein,1
give tey a try did richard iii have the princes in the tower done in that is one of the great mysteries of history and tey solves it in the daughter of time some critics consider this the greatest mystery novel ever written and i concur have read hundreds of mysteries many of them marvelous but the daughter of time is the best there are those who think christie the murder of roger ackroyd is best i do not because i had correctly figured out who the murderer was by page NUMBER,1
mystery for history buffs or a history for mystery buffs josephine tey takes us through a wonderful unraveling of centuries old history was richard iii the evil murderer of the princes or not i think this book one of the most fascinating mixes of history and mystery two of my favorite areas and reread it regularly so when my book club asked me to recommend a mystery this was an easy choice backed up by it ranking as one of amazon best mysteries of the century well they hated it why bother solving a centuries old mystery so i offer this experience to say that this is a terrific book if you like mysteries or english history others may not care for it,1
a big short read wonderfully written and hugely educational taking the reader from the theory of historical evidence to the stories of king richard iii,1
poor quality these pajamas last only two months before the silk started to tear at the waist and in the crotch area for this price i would expect that they would have been much better quality and last longer than two months,0
ripped off i recently bought these silk pajamas for my husband birthday within a week all the button fell off the top and the fabric frayed NUMBER NUMBER inches wide along the seams in the pants along the thighs i paid NUMBER dollars for these pajamas more than silk pjs listed from other suppliers on amazon expecting i was buying quality after a week use they are heading for the rag bag and i feel defrauded,0
very disappointed this arrived in a different package and bottle than shown the box has tear marks and is beat up it also has a nasty dirty spot where some sort of sticker was removed what a great looking christmas gift this will make,0
paper feed nightmare i just wanted to add my voice to those who already mentioned the problems with paper feed not long after i bought this model but too late to return it started having problems with the paper feed i now have to hand feed each piece of paper and even then it sometimes does not work the print quality is fine but what good is it if you can not get the paper in i now have to replace this new printer that was a couple of hundred dollars wasted,0
yes total waste of money this is the second hp printer i bought and frankly the only reason i tried this printer was because of the network connectivity i have not written many reviews before but this product is soo bad that i had to add to the list of angry customers getting the printer to load NUMBER piece of paper is a nightmare now i get paper jam warnings when there is no paper in the bloody machine anyone see office space yeah after i get my new canon printer i will re enact that scene perhaps i should record it and send it to hp,0
do not purchase i have actually not yet had the paper feed issue like the rest of the reviewers but this product has been horribly implemented i have continually had issues with attempting to install the NUMBER mb driver and hp solution center software on multiple different computers running different operating systems the scanner is about worn out as it makes a horrible grinding noise when scanning which started to occur within months of the purchase hp used to be known for their great quality in printers but this is unfortunately no longer the case do not buy,0
paper jams bloated driver shutdowns to begin the software installation is a headache i had trouble installing it even though i work in it why do you need a NUMBER mb NUMBER mb driver that requires you to turn off your anti virus during installation the printer jams often and will sometimes shutdown while printing while i think hp business grade printers are great this consumer grade printer is junk,0
yes the paper does not feed correctly i am in complete agreement with the rest of you who have had paper feeding problems the printer was fine at first although difficult to set up software now a month later the printer either does not take the paper or jams it has nothing to do with the quality of the paper i am also surprised that this was not discovered in testing i also noticed that the ink cartridges keep getting smaller what a rip off i have had it with hp printers i will never buy another,0
who framed roger rabbit i bought this movie new but it will not play on my dvd player i have tried several other players machine to play this in it will not work in any of them i am very disappointed with this product when i was looking at it on amazon it did not say it was not compatable with any system,0
no why did you send a dvd that you are very sure it does not work here in the united states does it make any sense for you why do not ask us to be sure before send it to another country if you know that it will not work on that country,0
idk it does not play in normal dvd players so idk where i could watch it i was looking forward to watching it,0
took my breath away ok maybe i am exaggerating just a little maybe it did not exactly take my breath away but it is an incredible dvd this is a real good movie however not exactly a phenomenon as steven speilberg claims in a brief interview on the dvd the dvd in itself with all the extra bonus materials is outstanding i found it to be very informative and very interesting to see how this movie was made and just how much dedication and extremely hard work it took just to get all the years worth animation included with the live action get it produced make countless sketches and finally get it out to the theaters well done very well done i could not be more pleased and more impressed with this special dvd release it definitely a must have,1
five stars aint nothin i give it NUMBER if i could my grandmother bought this for me when i was NUMBER years old i have loved since then i have not watched it in a while so i decided to watch it one day when nothing was interesting on t v this movie bought back so many memories of when me my cousins who i have not spoken to since i was NUMBER and friends were little i knew every song and every line get this movie it a classic and a good movie for adults as well as kids you will not regret buying this,1
hooked on the brothers super mario bros is a video game movie that is memorable in the way that may surprise you the witty dialogue and rapport between bob hoskins and john leguizamo as mario and luigi respectively make this film a real treat upon repeated viewings although it features a look that may remind people more of blade runner than super mario bros it has the same charm in its set design that other NUMBER s science fiction films have such as total recall or demolition man the tone shifts all over the place from light and comedic to dark and frightening but the sheer inventiveness on display here make super mario bros worth a watch dennis hopper gives a performance straight out of a david lynch film in this one watch this flick and i guarantee you will be hooked on the brothers,1
one of the worst movies ever made ok i am not going to get into this movie lack of similarities to the video games this movie just plain sucks i can not see why anybody over the age of twelve can enjoy this piece of you know what come on this movie has horrible acting a dreadfully bad story and hilariously unfunny jokes i think you people who gave this movie five stars really need professional help one star is far too generous i am not saying all the media incarnations of mario sucked the cartoons were actually pretty good but this movie in my opinion is what caused that chain of cartoons to end,0
a misunderstood and fun film not much i can say except that this movie is often riffed on for all the wrong reasons yes the movie is indeed flawed in many respects but at the same time it has a lot of great set pieces music good dialogue good cg and animatronics and a a scene using joe satroni music it just a fun movie worth riffing on if you hate it but a fun movie if you appreciate it for exactly what it is supposed to be a fun ride,1
could have been better i am a big fan of the super mario brothers the video game and the tv show i had high hope for this movie but boy what a waste of time this was this movie sure give the super mario brothers a bad name if you have not seen this movie i envy you nothing like the game of the show it never should have been made period,0
good its goooooooooooooood jim carrey voice i saw this movie way back when it came out in the theaters but that was so long ago so when i seen it on amazon i had to get it to see if it was as good as i remember it and it was better i tell you it is hard to even take it from the player i think it really good dennis hopper does a great job as koopa and the mario bros are great and for those of you who might think that the princess name should be peach not daisy you are a little off the page the character of daisy first shows up in super mario land as luigi girl while peach is mario duh,1
flawed concept here my problem while i do think we create a lot of our own problems in this life i do not think every single situation in life is one of our own creation to me saying that we create everything in our lives through our thought vibrations is saying that people in the world who are suffering are just not thinking correctly our experiences come to us because of our thoughts and beliefs really so for example the jews killed during the holocaust were just not sending out enough positive energy granted what the author is really talking about is much smaller situations in our everyday lives ones we can control but still this blanket statement about the power of thought really bothered me also i was looking for more concrete how to information which i found a bit lacking in this book i know the author was going for simplicity but i found the illustrations and exercises a bit too simplistic and not terribly helpful,0
pity the fool who do not buy this the best part about the a team besides no one getting hurt the homemade weapons the team member personalities and the bad badguys was the music from the intro to face srenading his girl du jour or murdock talking to his invisible dog to b a helping out at the youth center to the raging firefights and homemade weapons to the end credits the music in a team was always appropriate for the setting and always good i love it when a soundtrack comes together,1
rosemary baby this dvd came from england would not play on my player so i have returned it i am waiting on a credit i would not have ordered this had i know it was coming from england that i might have a problem,0
i loved everything about this movie the acting is fantastic direction outstanding chilling in every sense of the word i love this movie one of my top ten,1
a face only a mother could love yes devil conspiracy at it finest this is a true NUMBER ish classic and another epic from roman polanski how the lifestyle of doris day becomes satanic this devil worship genre was heavy stuff in the mid NUMBER coming as it did with the saga of sharon tate charles manson and polanski somehow tied into all of this nonetheless murder is murder and this movie is the depiction of darkness lucifer evil with the premise of the birth of the antichrist rosemary herself a witch not by choice battles endlessly with herself and her emotions as if reason could win this movie blurs all distinction between madness and reality as seen through the eyes of rosemary a truly remarkable groundbreaking flick that contrasts good and evil passion and reason a highly entertaining movie with a a great cast of future stars the extras are good,1
michael sings the classics these are the best known hits from the best loved shows the songs you go home humming and michael gorgeous and evocative voice really delivers the goods love this tour of great moments on stage,1
unbelieveable video and interesting stories unlike most of the reviews here i was able to play this hd dvd without any problems i use my xbox NUMBER to play hd dvds which is able to automatically get any updates that are needed anyway the movie follows the stories of multiple italian people all of different ages and background as they embark on different milestones in their lives the video is full of beautiful shots with great hi def detail the narration really adds to the video as none of the people speak english i definitely would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of italy my wife and i went there a few years ago and were happy to once again see places that we had visited,1
wish i had read the reviews these videos are fantastic from a documentary perspective but someone on the manufacturing crew screwed up the italy austrailia disks do not buy until the problem is fixed you will just have to send them back,0
disappointed i only wish that more time was devoted to the natural beauty of italy and its cities towns and natural coutryside particulary in the north as opposed to horse racing auto racing etc,0
firmware fixed it i just updated to the newest firmware NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER and the disc is now playable in my xa NUMBER big relieve for all i hope review of the source to follow,0
does not work read the reviews about this disk not working figured they were old reviews and had fixed the problems very disappointed in that they are still selling this defective disk brand new xbox hd dvd player refuses to boot with this,0
good cd player but third rate headphones this cd player is a great one when it comes to travel and portability but only four months after i got it the headphones stopped working properly when they do work they do not work on the left side and you usually have to play around with it before it does but still it a great system nice audio quality too,1
detailed but not to much i was impressed with how mr philbrick was able to share just the right amount of detail when reading the narrative of the canniblaism i was just about to shout enough when he stopped the book flowed well and was never boring the explanations of whaling and the culture both in nantucket and on ship were well done the sadness of wrong decisions and how they can have such a devestating affect on others is something many of us can relate to as we make decisions throughout life i appreciated the epilogue but felt the extensiveness of the notes were unnecessary it was already evident that much research had gone into this book this book is certainly not for everyone those who are looking for a love story will not find it here it is a true story about people coping in an extreme situation and what they feel they must resort to,1
a sea and survival story of epic proportions this true story takes place in the early to middle NUMBER and its location on nantucket island and in the middle of nowhere asea you learn that looking for whales is a group effort and when one is found a grueling and dangerous activity to land it the ship essex was sunk by a whale and that was the inspiration for writing moby dick it is most interesting reading about the survival of a few and how they eventually made it back to land a pageturner,1
riveting story of survival and death at sea this is one of my favorite books of all time the shocking sinking of the essex the inspiration for moby dick is only the beginning of what the author turns into a gut wrenching tale of a handful of sailors desperately trying to stave off starvation thirst and madness as they try to make it from the middle of the pacific back to south america philbrick writing is clear powerful and incredibly engaging it a hard book to both put down and get out of your mind after finishing it,1
inside the whalers philbrick takes the reader on a journey like no other and explains each wave along the way i could not put it down i had a special interest in that my great great grandfather was a whaling captain master and traveled those waters with my great grandfather as a toddler on board my one criticism of the author perspective is what he did not critique cannibalism i know it is easy to point fingers when i was not there starving and dying of thirst but the author went too far in the other direction and became their justifiers based on the accounts of two survivors who chose to eat their friends why was there not a serious discussion about chosing to die with dignity rather than deify life at the cost of eating and drinking your friends perhaps the men who died earlier did hold to this why was that not a significant part of this work nevertheless thank you nate philbrick for a book that should be made into a movie with some of this balance,1
great historical account of good and bad leadership a bare facts historical account of the sinking of the essex by a sperm whale and the enfolding events after that the failure of the captain led to unnecessary loss of life when he gave in to his first mate influence to sail east in the small whaleboats in spite of his own gut feeling that they should sail west we may not like some of the decisions they made in order that some of them might have the chance to stay alive but we until we are in their shoes we can not be judgmental great book,1
what a wonderful story what a wonderful and often time touching story it is very hard to believe what those men went thru they were dealt one bad card after another and yet they still endured i recommend this book to everyone especially those who think that they have is bad,1
in the heart of the sea the tragedy of the whaleship essex the condition is somewhat less than perfect but not much the book is wonderful fascinating story and very well researched and written,1
the sinking of the whale ship essex this book is a wonderful story of the lives of the sailors on the whaling ships of the period their adventure on the ship essex as it left port sailing for new grounds little was know about the islands of the pacific and in thisstory it was a sad effect that could have made their rescue shorter and saved some lives some parts of the story even though it was factual was too much detail in the death of some of the ship mates their lives after their rescue i found interesting in the way that they personally found solace in the jobs theytook up i would recommend this book it was the chosen book by our book club of women and all found it interesting,1
how does this novel stack up with the penguin version i have not read this book but i was wondering how this book stacks up with the penguin version loss of the whale ship essex sunk by a whale from what i understand this novel is a retelling of events while the penguin classics is the actual accounts of two of the crew members i am a bit torn as to which one i should read purchase all comments are very much appreciated,1
an exciting tale of survival the sinking of the essex by a whale is probably most famous as the inspiration for herman melville moby dick but in in the heart of the sea the tragedy of the whaleship essex by nathaniel philbrick the reader will be engaged in an adventure more exciting than most works of fiction the author skillfully combines elements from the accounts of two survivors to locate the truth of the tale in addition one will become immeresed in the history of nantucket the whaling industry including graphic accounts of the hunt not for the faint hearted and other elements of this particular place and time in history an exciting read and a fine speciman of that popular creature the true survival story highly recommended,1
poetry with a knack for memorable imagery paul hoover is an experienced and successful poet having published six earlier books of award winning poetry totem and shadow new and selected poems continues to document his impressive talent wedded to an innate knack for memorable imagery after miss graven remarks boy my left eye cries when i see kids play violins and things how did they get so young and i can not stop my fractures when they strike toy xylophones in a song too sentimental mechanical sugarplum fairies it brutal of them t kill me with growing up like this and mrs pollen who tends them why is she so kind under her matronly woolens what is so appealing in a clumsy fuzzy third grader ghostly in polyester as any sad adult sure there no god to do it but they should have bright violent minds to brace them for a while and one tough look keep them when christmas is not the mood,1
not the real thing i could not believe my eyes when i saw the amazingly low price for this product i guess i got what i paid for since these pills did not work at all the ingredients list the same as phazyme but offered no relief,0
a sports world comedy sporting two wonderful stars hepburn and tracy at their finest in the story of a female athlete and her shady agent an agent who turns out to be a good guy when he finds the right woman in the guise of hepburn hepburn got to display her range of athletic skills in this film alongside some of the great female golfers and men and women tennis stars of the NUMBER great film,1
yuck i must respectfully disagree with the NUMBER star rating for this cd the reason being is that i have never heard such muck up of vivaldi four seasons i have to admit i bought this cd purely for piazzolla NUMBER seasons and now i am convinced that i definitely must search for a different performance of it being almost certain that this one is not doing it justice,0
still a mystery anybody who is interested in learning about the beauty of sufism should not turn to this book this book in fact does not examine anything of intellectual spiritual or social value as related to sufism or islam i have come across many books written by so called sufi masters who expound upon the complexity of the universe with inspirational imagery this is not one of them while books in this genre easily turn into polemics this one surely takes the unenlightened cake the stream of consciousness writing style lacks purpose in this setting and appears to have been an way out of organizing a coherent book of ideology,0
great book very good book quick read good story and beautiful illustrations got this for myself to read but am going to have my NUMBER yr old read it as well,1
works great love it i was able to easily search for a wireless network and set up my tivo to my wireless internet works flawlessly,1
tivo wireless adapter if you can not connect your tivo using an ethernet cord then this is the next best thing this is the only wireless adapter that you should using if you own a tivo this adapter was specifically design for tivo,1
tivo wireless adapter making tivo apart of my wireless network was easy to do and now i can watch what is on either tivo no matter which room i am in,1
great buy bought this item for half or what a local computer store wanted worked right out of the box very good product,1
tivo wireless adaptor quick to ship and arrive price better than from tivo only annoyance is that tivo requires a specialized wireless g usb adaptor,1
works as it should got it opened it plugged it in entered my net info and bob your flippin mother sister brother,1
tivo wireless adapter great product works extremely well my modem is in my basement and the adapter is upstairs i get an NUMBER signal strength highly recommend,1
not too compatible with imac the set up requirement for the tivo wireless connector to my apple wireless network would require me to change the setup of all the other components on my network when tivo worked on the network my printer did not it was less of a hassle to get an ethernet cable and plug it in,0
wasted my money i spent an entire afternoon trying to get this piece of junk to talk to my wireless network went through the steps a bazillion times it found my network and could not get an ip address after wep key entered customer service were on the phone with me for hours and i think it safe to say we tried everything their final suggestion was call your isp comcast who were unable to help so i bought a new tivo specifically to use on my network so i could broadcast my mp NUMBER collection through my av system and can not add to the fact thatthe new tivo is giving problems switching channels and you can see what a giant step backwards i took if i could give this zero stars i would,0
wireless is the way to go this little gizmo works as promised it great if you want to transfer shows from one tv to another in your house you can also download programs to your laptop providing you have tivo to go plus i will never get stuck with another clunker of a movie on an airplane again it took me a little time to figure out that in the setting up stage of connecting your adapter you were not supposed to enter the router password but rather the complicated encryption key,1
works easy installation tivo has a rating of reception and i could not get it to go more than NUMBER but it still works,1
it works this wireless adapter is the only one that worked right for my tivo i had bought one at radio shack of a different brand and it did not work at all but the tivo adapter was easy to plug in and set up i have been able to watch online movies through netflix and now i do not need to plug in the ethernet cord to the modem router,1
real plug and play plugged it in and my series NUMBER dt popped up a config screen entered my wpa password and i was good to go simple set and good range,1
it works not too much to say about this adapter it does what it supposed to sure an n adapter would be better but even the g is over priced,1
great product easy to setup without having to read the manual haha and works great without having to worry about compatibility problems,1
works perfectly and a great price short and sweet had it working flawlessly for NUMBER weeks now no problems at all,1
great price and works perfect i paid less and got the exact same tivo wireless adapter as sold by tivo i have had no problems and now i get updates and download shows to my computer without any cables,1
tivo wirelss g ordered on same day as tivo but came NUMBER NUMBER days later caused a delay in hooking up it would helpful to ensure shipping at the same time especially when one unit is dependant on the other unit dropped off line after the first installation and had to be rebooted seems to be ok now this is my first tivo and adapter so i have nothing to compare this product with,1
works with my pioneer dvr NUMBER h i had purchased another wireless network adapter that would not work for my dvr approx NUMBER yrs old now this tivo adapter connected and works great saved a lot of cash too by purchasing through amazon instead of tivo directly,1
died NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER purchased NUMBER NUMBER i have NUMBER tivo in the house and each uses a different type of wifi adaptor i bought the tivo ag NUMBER to connect my series NUMBER to my linksys router in NUMBER to replace a linksys adaptor to get better speed never got the faster speed but it worked fine for NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER years and died suddenly i giving two stars because it did not last very long the other wifi adaptors linksys and microsoft are still working and they are older i do want to note that the tivo wifi adaptor runs hot while the others are not even warm,0
great product and easy to use we unpacked this small module plugged it into the tivo followed the on screen instructions and we were set up within NUMBER minutes we cancelled our landline telephone service not considering that our tivo subscription required dial up access we ordered this product right away and it arrived within NUMBER days and was simple to set up so far no problems,1
i like hardy but i loved the mayor i like this story the most of hardy works an interesting tale with some good realistic characters i think i will read it again,1
i liked this book at first i was a little confused as to how hardy could stretch what seemed to be a simple plot into such a long novel especially because the story in blurb on the back cover happened within the first NUMBER pages but the story is more than the blurb on the back cover it is about betrayal last wishes the evils of drink and how one mistake can affect you NUMBER years down the road hardy fatalistic view seen through henchard is at times enough to drive the reader crazy like many of the other reviewers here i cried throughout the book there are constant turns in the story line that at times uplift your soul and then crash it into the depths of depression this book is not an easy read though there are sections that you will struggle to get through because it is dry but then there are others that will keep you up at night rushing to finish i liked this book slightly less than i liked tess but it was tess that made me buy this book enjoy,1
dubious creation there is already a book very similar to this one about a dog adventure in paris findley took credit with the true author approval however for this book that john demires actually entirely wrote the book was indeed entertaining and it gave a good overview of many of new orleans novel attractions,0
hard questions real answers this book asks some hard questions in the way it scrutinizes the bible reverend teel then answers the questions in a way that makes sense and gives a real understanding of the possibilities the book asks the reader to set aside all preconceived notions on religion jesus and god and take a look at it in a most unique way i went into the book on the defensive as a fundamentalist christian and found myself following the argument of reverend teel and even at moments agreeing with him while i certainly do not agree with all of the points he brings out he does bring up some really good questions and gives some really provocative and thought provoking answers he asks the reader only to keep an open mind and in the end i was moved by the book i am recommending it to all of my friends,1
snooz a pa looza total waste of celluloid not to mention time money etc not entertaining at all not creative at all not artistic in the least absolutely nothing happens in this ill attempt at making something provocative the viewer gets to accompany someone who resembles cobain for an uneventful boring walk in the woods and a mission to avoid any contact with anyone else the only thing that kept me from ejecting the dvd was my faith in ole gus i kept saying to myself this can not be all there is to this film i kept waiting until even all the credits had rolled as if there would be some surprise or explanation for wasting all that film snorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrre,0
horrible i have to say that i am a pretty big kurt fan i was excited when this movie came out because i felt it might actually be pretty good the only good thing i can say about this movie was that the actor looked semi like kurt and thats it it was a def bummer and i had to pull myself through it i really can not understand why we can not just leave him alone hes a great artist with a great band the legend should be left to rest in peace kurt probably turning in his grave over this if you have ever read anything about him you would know this is not what he would have wanted all in all take my word for it this is a waste of money and time,0
worst movie ever absolute worst movie that i have ever seen i never write movie reviews but this was so bad and hopelessly boring that i felt obligated to say something heres the movie guy stumbles around his house mumbling to himself in a dress with a shotgun treated to a full boyz NUMBER men video on a tv guy stumbles around and sits in a greenhouse mumble mumble silence and camera focused on a bush for NUMBER mins guys drunk friends come to his house guy plays a song NUMBER guys kiss and lay on eachother in bed guy makes mac and cheese guy dies in his greenhouse awesome movie makes me want to watch dude wheres my car,0
what a waste unfortunately this is supposed to be inspiration for the last days of kurt cobains life leave it to this jackass who sold out to everything kurt cobain was not let alone this story was told from someone whom never met the man merely this movie was from someone who watched the doors too many times what a waste another person selling out to the all mighty dollar trying to make his film career i recommend buying any album from nirvana if you want to know the true singer in the shadows,0
dissapointed i caught this movie a while ago while it was playing still playing at the theater i was very saddened by how dissapointing it turned out to be i am sorry michael pitt is the wrong choice to play kurt cobain even if this is just inspired after the famous late musician the trouble is i do not think anyone could really play kurt i suppose there are people in this movie kim gordan of sonic youth and the director gus van sant who actually knew kurt while he was alive so they know something i do not obviously regardless of the mis casting in my opinion the film is terribly slow and ultimately kind of pointless we already know how it going to end like with elephant but the same director asks that he keep our attention spans going till the end to satisfy his obsession with these real life tragic outcomes i admire van sant lofty goal to create a piece of cinema to attribute to my hero kurt but it just falls short in the end,0
difficult read this story is one of the most difficult stories i have read thus far i am supposed to summarize the story for an english majors course but because the sentences are so long and tangled i keep losing track of which character is being talked about i have read and reread the story but still have difficulty summarizing the story the excruciatingly long paragraphs are what makes it so difficult to follow use caution when reading this story,0
an insult to the english language i just finshed reading it for my sophomore honors class and i am sure that i will never voluntarily read faulkner ever again throughout the novel there is no use of punctaution such as an apostrophe and the sentences run on for as long as a whole page the first hundred pages require more attention than a tale of two cities and the narration gets worse from there it as if faulkner did not want to appeal to or reach any person and to make matters worse there are no book notes anywhere save essays that can help understand it and so do not read this voluntarily but if you have to good luck and hope that they have made sparknotes for intruder in the dust,0
do not waste your money buy NUMBER rd edition used the back cover states thoroughly updated for it fourth edition not true the only difference between this and the NUMBER rd edition is that the three clinical problem sets at the back of the NUMBER rd edition pages NUMBER have been replaced by a set of additional questions called the maintenance of certification primer pages NUMBER in the first NUMBER pages there may be a few questions that have changed between the NUMBER editions but i have not found one yet even chapter NUMBER the pictorial atlas is unchanged and i suspect the same will be true for the NUMBER online practice exams bottom line buy the NUMBER rd edition used for about NUMBER and save yourself NUMBER still this book is ok for fp boards as is swanson,0
great for novices who want to stay that way elaine and peter are career authors they obviously do not use the products they write about and this book is no exception it is lacking in common sense good advice and practical tips and techniques this series tends to be quite good overall but the authors obvious unfamiliarity with the product they are writing about shines through vividly if that were not bad enough many of the examples are poor quality and look bitmapped in a vector book shame,0
expected more not as good as celtic woman or hanley westenra i would say not half good i can say they have great talent but artistically wrong managed stopped watching after NUMBER min,0
high energy performance these women rock this is a wonderful performance by NUMBER very talented string musicians it is impossible to watch this video and not start dancing or at the least tapping your feet i enjoy watching it while i am cooking really gets me in a festive mood highly recommend it if you enjoy up tempo contemporary music,1
did not quite live up to expectations but still enjoyable as musicians bond really stands out even on this dvd but as show women they need a lot of work haylie quickly became annoying as the spotlight hog and as a group they did not do much in the way of actual entertaining they simpy played their music it may possible that it was planned that way consider the british audience but if that was the case they should have recorded some other performance for release on dvd in short if you are a fan of bond you will want this but do not expect too much from it,1
useless for home theatre or tv show this product is good for uk only to play in usa you need to find a dvd player which has capability for changing region code to uk and that you may be able to do it on computer but not on dvd player in usa i order it in usa prodact came from uk and i could not play it on my most advanced dvd player,0
wonderful techniques i am now a devoted jean warren fan NUMBER NUMBER math is great for the under NUMBER set i have two children NUMBER and NUMBER and they both have gained so much from the easy activities in this book,1
solid overall helmut rilling does well with large scale works of bach which is a plus on the b minor mass everything is well articulated with solid bass lines often lacking in authentic performances he captures the faith aspect very well his crucifixus is the best i have heard in capturing the pain of the cross followed by the brilliant contrast of et resurrexit he has an excellent cast of soloists it flows well but has a very slight feel of heavy footedness it has none of the dance quality so prominent in the mauersberger recording rudolf mauersberger one of few who can bring out both dance and devotion overall most people who are not too much into historically informed would find this quite satisfying,1
excellent service i order the water shoes and was very pleased with my purchase it is excatly what i wanted and i got it in no time flat i was a little hesitant about ordering on line but this experience was well worth it,1
well made but runs a little small five star rating for the quality of the product but they run small i ordered a large and it was just too small for me i wear NUMBER pants comfortably although i measure NUMBER around my waist at its thickest point my thigh is NUMBER at its thickest point and i measure NUMBER around my butt,1
used to be good i have lots of these using them almost daily as underware my first pair having purchased at least NUMBER years ago my two most recent purchases of these has yielded a variety of quality and sizes seems like they are being made in multiple overseas sweet shops with little quality control will not be buying again,0
wrong size i have no idea how good or bad this item is amazon advertised size m for this item and i ordered it when it came it was s and i did not know it until after my grandson brought it back saying it was the wrong size when i looked it was a s i had thrown all the papers away so i am stuck with a size small for the next yard sale i have or someone has,0
works as advertised no complaints for wicking abilities and chafing prevention just make sure you pull down the cuffs before you start running otherwise your area may be irritated by the bunching of this and your underwear once you remember to do that you are set,1
dumping it down the drain this product obviously works well for most but it made my twins extremely fussy gassy and spit up like crazy not only did i hate to see them screaming with discomfort but it was the hardest day i have had yet as a new mom to twins yes i said day i took mmp as directed for only one day the babies fussed all day and night leaving me no time to pump to even see if there was an increase in supply i cut out the mmp and went back to plain fenugreek the next day and everyone is happy again i am pretty sure it the blessed thistle that caused the issues i tried previously adding blessed thistle capsules to my supplementation routine and we had similar issues although not anywhere near the degree as with mmp i hate leaving a negative review for a product so widely loved and touted but i did not find anything about effects similar to my experience so i felt the need to share,0
original poem not used images were of modern players there are several altered versions of thayer classic poem in existance this book uses one of them i love this poem and i wish the author had stuck with the original especially when ernest lawrence thayer is listed as the author also the images of casey and the spectators are of modernday participants casey is wearing a helmet and his name andnumber are on the back of his uniform not like a playerin NUMBER at all leroy neiman is a great artist and that is the only reason i give this NUMBER stars,0
this seems like an excuse to get hester back on the battlefield not one of the stronger entries in the series slaves of obsession suffers from too many set pieces and not enough of the emotional complexity usually found in this series far too much time is spent on the philosophical battle between union and confederate issues battles better detailed in many other works and not enough on developing a strong narrative the trip to america for monk and hester to recapture an american and his runaway english teen on a charge of murder is relatively ridiculous and only serves as an opportunity for perry to showcase hester nursing ability it an interesting scene but really just fills pages and does not move the narrative forward even the mystery solution resolution left me less than satisfied a perfunctory ending to a pedestrian entry in the series,0
maya i loved the cover when i saw it and i was very excited to receive it i like this artists music but was not too thrilled with this cd it was not what i thought it would be and very jungle like,0
a lesson in human tragedy this piece is ultimate steinbeck the author has limited his characters to two major ones and a few ancillary ones the book is short however the tale is told thoroughly the reader feels so very sorry for george george is a study of loyalty decency and patience and how one feels so utterly responsible for the life of another human being in this case his childhood friend lennie who is somewhat mentally challenged this book is a sad account of the fragility of human beings and how one person will be loyal to the other person til the end even if he needs to commit murder to show it the character candy is so very pathetic too and his comments about a stranger killing my old dog are so very sad one tends to think that it was because of candy feeling badly about a stranger killing his dog that george does what he does this is a beautiful book,1
of mice and men more like manly mice i found several critical problems with this play including narrative structure plot thematics metaphorical irony and satirical narcissism serious scholars need not apply the books are not for the people to do with lenny and carl shooting the tragedy in the end is an unfortunate incident for the lives of everyone on the earthen structures if you are good looking for steinbeck i suggest the rapes of wrath,0
read this book i thought that of mice and men was a pretty good book it told a story of a relationship between two friends if you do not like cussing in a book then this is not the one to read otherwise it was really good,1
a simple story that says so much short but marvelous that of mice and men in three words but that nutshell does extreme injustice to the true wonder of this classic through this tale john steinbeck was able to say so much in so little words never before have i seen so many themes bonded so seemlessly together without being boring and flat no of mice and men was enjoyable and i would never mind reading it again i will never forget of mice and men for it has found its own special place in my heart and forever there it will remain,1
lexi a w student of maces lane middle school the best book i have ever read of mice and men by john steinbeck was the best book i have ever read the characters the mentally retarded lennie and the tough george are on the run from people from weed lennie was accused of trying to rape a girl in a red dress when he actually wanted to touch it since it was so soft after that they find a ranch in salinas california to work on for a while there are conflicts and solutions all at the same time my favorite character was lennie because even though he was really mentally retarded he was kind and did nothing out of harm he knew that george loved him by giving tough love while on the ranch all he thought about was the rabbits i get to tend the rabbits was my all time favorite quote because he always said it to remind himself what he was going to do when they got off the farm sometimes i always thought he was rather hopeful even when he was sad,1
of mice and men izzy g of mice and men was a great book it told about how and little man named george who was smart and a dumb man lennie who was really big and strong this book explained how the one man helps out another guy that isnt smart at all and just needs taking caring of because his aunt clara died well while they both keep working on the fields bucking barley they come up with an idea to own a house and a couple of acres well lennie loves to rub soft things so he wants to just get the house and tend the rabbits the book is just a good book of how good of friends can work together and when something goes wrong a friend has to do the thing that is best for the other,1
great piece of american literature i was in NUMBER th grade when i read this book for the first time and i was very impressed in my opinion this book is one of the finest books ever written by an american author steinbeck it takes place in the early NUMBER where NUMBER friends find a job helping out on a farm they meet several interesting people there and run in to some problems throughout this movie they are in search of what they refer to as the fat of the land or the american dream all around this was a great book and i highly recomend it to anyone who has not yet read it,1
review for of mice and men of mice an men is a great novel it sends you back in time to the great depression era of the NUMBER it is a good book for middle school students the reason i gave this book four stars is because of the profane languange used in the book except for the language this book is a great book to read,1
astonishing a masterpiece bravo by far one of the best books ever written i felt as if i was in the book taking part of the adventure john steinbeck has made it clear that he is among the elite writers in the margin between william shakespeare and edgar allan poe the feeling you get is indescribable when you read this book the story of when george and lennie will have their own land and lennie could finally raise rabbits just gives you your own sense of liberty please if you are sensitive and or depressed be aware this book is great but very depressing,1
of mice and men by ruben from tx of mice and men in this story there are two very good friends george and lennie they are on a journey for a better life lennie is mentally ill so george teaches him right from wrong on the way they are leaving a little town and going to another town in search of a better job several of lennie habits get then fired from their last job so they hope that they will have better luck in the next one lennie makes quite a few mistakes but no matter what george manages to over look them until lennie makes a very big mistake which leads to a shocking ending,1
do not read this book when i started reading the book at school i found it boring i had to read it for school if i did not read it i would had a NUMBER and almost all the class found it boring it funny when leenie principal characters who does stupid thing george say in one part to the owner of the ranch i am not saying he bright he ai not but he as strong as a bull but the theme does not make it a pleasure to read the book is easy to understand and does not have difficult words the story is about to people george and leenie who are itinerant workers who go to one place to another to find job they have a dream but it very difficult for them to make it true because of leenie dumbness when they are working in ranch problems happens because of leenie the entire story is about that subject to finish my review ill tell you not to spend your time reading this book when there are better books unless you have to read it for school i could only recommended to steinbecks fans,0
of mice and men my youngest daughter is an avid reader and loves re reading books she was assigned in english class in fact she is a collector of these required assigned readings such as of mice and men,1
of mice and men the story oif mice and men is a good book because there is never really a dull moment i expected the book to be about mice i later found out it was really about this book was about two lowlife farmers who are trying to get their own stake george is the brighter one who is in charge of the operation so the book takes place in a rural area in california i t is a fiction book it a rally good book so you should check it out,1
of mice and men a classic as always in the today world of teaching tolerance and differences this remains a good one to use in the classroom,1
wow this book is short but man it packs a touching message i had to read it for a class and analyze everything about it and it really is a touching story if you put everything together the ending completely surprised me and i can see why george decided to do that it left me crying for both george and lennie for everything they had been through i will never forget this book and will continue reading it throughout the years lennie may have been dumb but he was still smart in his own special ways,1
awesome this book has been great it brings a lot of emotions and it cool to see different types of people caring for each other and having a real great friendship until the end,1
do not read this book my english teacher read this book outloud to us it was the worst thing ever i feel asleep every day he read it because it was so boring it seemed like it took forever to finish so do not read this book unless you want somthing really really boring,0
you must read this book of mice and men by john steinback is a great book to read it is a book about how george a small quick guy helps lennie a big guy who is not very smart through the story george always helps lennie this book makes you want to keep on reading to find out what happens my favorite part about of mice and men is that it has a sad ending it not one of those boring story where it has a happy endind this book is more unique,1
winning the affiliate game using just a few of the principles found in this book is helping me turn my sites into cash generators instead of just static sites hoping someone will stop by thanks declan for providing information that truly helps the average everyday person become successful in this awesome frontier called the internet,1
lukewarm at best i saw this in a little theatre in manhattan hoping for a more polished morrissey rich experience but this was a pretty sub par affair and frankly it annoying to see a film this poor with even decent distribution terrible camerawork and spotty acting over all bad editing and annoying cali pop punk soundtrack only saved by the presence of quasi i was really disappointed when people put such little effort and inspiration into something and they get support one less person with a real vision gets heard it was occasionally worth a laugh but overall i found myself angry at the gods for opening up the pandora box of indie films without keeping the hacks out we have enough of those in hollywood,0
overrated the funniest parts of this book are the ones used to get you to buy it the rest was lame i found myself yawning the only good thing about this book is how small it is the boredom ends in a couple of hours,0
pretty good but not all new to me i bought this book when my twins were NUMBER months old and i wanted some guidance on daytime napping and a lot of friends had recommended healthy sleep habits i did not mean to buy fussy baby since mine are too old for that so be careful when you buy this package that you get both books i had already read a lot of books on sleep training and while there were some really good tips here i found contented little baby book by gina ford more direct weissbluth allows for more discretion which i think a mother needs and overall i think this is a very good book to be read in conjunction with other philosophies and you can adapt what works for your style and babies a must read if your baby does not sleep very much and you think it is ok that way it not,1
save your money as an avid movie goer this just about changed me to a non movie goer the lesson i learned was to pay a little attention before dropping your money into a maybe it might be good because adam sandler is in it movie boy was i wrong this is not even worth renting bad bad stupid poor writing acting filming generally it sucked,0
wonderful watch it twice or you are missing out the first time i saw this movie in the theater i remember liking it but being so sad at the end nevertheless as i love drew and adam i bought it on dvd when it came out i could not believe how much i laughed now that i knew the ending it was not so sad that i missed the rest of the movie there are so many clever scenes in this movie that i think people forget if they just watch it once when drew attacks rob schneider with a bat when adam jokes with his walrus and penguin when adam apologizes to drew for not being better looking i can go on and on this is the movie my husband and i put on when we want to laugh and cuddle on the couch on friday night it perfect,1
another must have dvd from sandler i do love adam sandler and i thought him and drew made a great pair in the wedding singer so i just had to watch this i was not disappointed it is refreshing to watch a movie where both fun things occur as well as there are well written punch lines henry sees lucy as a challenge being it she has lost her memory and he makes it his everyday job to make her fall for him sooner or later he bound to fall for her too the real challenge is for him to come up with new methods to make her remember it turns out to be a charming romantic and very touching movie one of the best movies in this genre to come out in NUMBER,1
schizophrenic product at the core of the movie is an affecting concept a man who falls in love with a woman who can not remember him the following morning so each day he has to make her fall in love with him all over again it a touching situation and the two co leads play this aspect of the movie with delicacy and charm however this was not enough for the marketing development people so they added a ton of crude slap stick and a lot of stale and offensive sexual humor this robs the movie of any chance it might have had to touch the viewer heart and left me wondering how the movie ever made it out of the cutting room the earlier movie in which these two co leads appeared the wedding singer was fortunate enough not to suffer from these drawbacks NUMBER first dates is a movie worth missing,0
the first fifty sandler movies could be cut and re edited in arbitrary sequences and nobody would notice sandler is the apotheosis of the one trick pony the actor who is always exactly the same character in every film in short he does not act at all like yahweh he just that he is a look at the expression on the face of ms barrymore in the picture on the dvd cover that exactly how i look when i find myself watching another adam sandler film unfortunately my teenage son and my two twenty something nieces all find sandler rib splitting funny being a companionate adult therefore i sit cross legged among them and gape at the screen forcing a chuckle now and then like a losing presidential candidate at a town meeting then sometimes i offer to run out for ice cream,0
alot like life funny tragic i will not bore you with the plot of the movie as i assume you have an idea what it about if you have come this far i found the film stood up quite well as a romantic comedy it was both delightfully funny and a bit sad at times just like life i am surprised that some of the reviewers have taken the film so seriously and are disturbed by how the critical events are portrayed it just a film and it meant to entertain it did a great job of that with the terrific on screen chemistry of sandler although i can not stand him in most other films and barrymore,1
fall in love for the first time everyday the idea behind this film is that in a successful relationship you have to fall in love over and over again in this story it happens literally everyday the performances adam sandler as henry roth shows his vulnerable side in his best and most natural performance drew barrymore as lucy whitmore has never been better and has great chemistry with adam she emerges as a fine actor rob schneider as ula may fool you that he is really the character he is playing i did not know it was him for half the move he is brilliantly funny sean astin as doug whitmore better known as sam from the lord of the rings is funny in this comic role as lucy lisping brother brown as nick tattoo face the cook is great in his small role and deserves bigger roles in the future shot in hawaii it has beautiful cinematography and vibrant color the movie is a combination of humor and romance with more heart than you might expect,1

so did you read the dna report it appears that except indologist everybody else know how to read mtdna findings nowhere in the book i could read the recent breakthrough about the lack of genetic evidence on aryan invasion and migration and after concluding that indus valley had the evidence of fire place shiva and shakti seals and so on she then again go back to the imaginary of how european white aryan descended to the black dravidian world of indus valley if that is how westerner try to write history of other cultures i myself being a westerner feel very sorry for my own people the bottom line is this do not try to defend something that is indefensible please start writing all the facts in details and tell us cleary what happened to the indus valley culture did it disappear or continued as the vedic culture,1
i like it alot from an non latin i first started listening to azucar moreno through a friend in new york a long time ago this is exciting music and you do not have to understand spanish to get into the party feeling of this music flamenco latin pop whatever you want to call it every album seems to have one standout pop booty shaker i think tequila claims this title but besame is cool and tu eres para mi is funky cool and hay que matar a la muerte pops with energy,1
topper is tops it become my favorite video joan blondell and carole landis the poor man betty grable are great as the two party gals who go to a spooky old mansion to claim the inheritance that landis has been awarded billy burke as mrs topper is a scream and so is her side kick maid patsy kelly no one could do a double take better than patsy and rochester as cosmo topper man servant is hysterical the beautiful camera work the women gowns the top notch special effects and the hysterical sight gags ranks this with the best of abbott and costello comedies a terrific excuse to while away an hour and a half when you are feeling down or bored best scene the playful seal and rochester,1
no thanks but barbie is cool i like baby dolls but not this one i love phoebe and roxxi so maybe i would get the big baby versions of those but no other big bratz babyz this doll is not soft so so much for hugging and cuddling it it kind of cute but i would get big baby phoebe and roxxi only as for your false lies about barbie people are still buying them mattel has not given up and barbie will still be aroundfor years to come i love both barbie and bratz and nothing willchange that,0
vanessa harmonium a work of art vanessa carlton release of her second album shows how talented she really is her touch of piano to the tracks make the album what it is original and breath taking white house who to say afterglow private radio half a week before the winter and she floats stand out from the rest of the album each one reveals vanessa look on life from the past present and future they also show how she see the world and what she wishes it could be the rest of harmonium contain tracks that are amazing as well for they tell stories which are ear catching this album is not what i expected it to be after hearing her debut one harmonium is a work of art,1
amazing cd this is by far a better cd than vanessa first all i have to say is that this is one of the best albums that i have ever listened to whos to say has become one of my favorite songs san francisco is also an amazing song vanessa really shows what a great artist she is in this album,1
harmonium the second coming of vanessa carlton harmonium is such an incredible record and it completely exceeds my initial expectations for vanessa carlton sophomore album it is a little different from NUMBER be not nobody in the sense that we are allowed to take a deeper look into vanessa beautiful and sometimes dark soul i would have to say that most of the treasures on this record are the more upbeat songs some of these songs that steal the show are the bittersweet white houses a summer song about friendship love and loss and who to say a song about choosing between family and a relationhip also though a little dark annie shines on harmonium if you are not already a nessaholic you will be once you hear this talented ivory tickler show off her gift harmonium is in stores now so go out and pick it up now,1

perfect fits great looks great had no problems with it at all i would recommend anyone buying this for crossplay its ligit,1
bad do not buy it this item does not even look like the one the picture it not the real thing and it a bootleg one,0
a very informative book i expected a work on stalking to be very dry and difficult to get through this book however was extremely interesting informative and easy to read it is the sort of book that the normal man in the street could read and apply as easily as someone who is more knowledgeable about the subject a wonderful handbook for anyone having troubles of this nature and a wothwhile read for any safety conscious individual,1
plenty of emotion i do not agree that clay shows no emotion one needs only to listen to the way measure of a man run to me or music from the ai season solitaire here there and every where to hear plenty of emotion and inflection let us not forget silver bells and give a little love this chrismas forgive me if i got the title wrong hopefully some of you have had a chance to listen to some of his demo music with many spiritual songs and one song that brought me to tears i will be there not only can this artist belt it out he can also whisper softly and pull you right into the song but i digress as for my review of this cd the problem is not the singer or the voice of the singer but the weakness of the songs and their production hopefully they will take more time with clay next cd and bring music to the table that matches his talent i recommend the cd on the strength of clay voice and the way it makes you feel even the weaker songs,1
awesome listened to the cd three times and love it catchy tunes i caught myself humming throughout the day love ballads that i so moving great mix of songs it sure beats listening to some of the hard core music we have on the radio today a few tunes were almost beatles sounding clean and refreshing clay should just stay the way he is and his style should be left untarnished by the whoever tries to change it anyone who wants an enjoyble cd that they can understand and feel good while listening to it should buy this cd the cd just makes you feel good clay sounds great,1
hot hot hot this man is a superstar in the making i can not describe the wonderful voice of this young man its so awesome he takes my breath away i recommend this cd to everyone he shows such emotion and love with each note he sings thank you clay aiken for this magnificent cd and i so look forward to your tour and your next cd,1
why will not amazon post my review i wonder why amazon will not post my review of this album i loved clay on american idol but he lost get over it this album is average at best stop pushing him as though he won reuben is the winner and clay measure of a man does not measure up to reuben soulful,0
yawn do not get me wrong clay can really sing his voice is good enough but his music is just so corny and boring all ballads and want to be broadway sounding songs i can not even bear to listen i only do it to figure out what all the furor is about i still have not save yourself the effort,0
schmalz in the new edition of webster they should stick a photo of this to define schmalz oh my god is this what our music culture has devolved to this album was inflicted on me as i was in border the other day i left without buying anything which is unusual for me by the way cats are wonderful creatures,0
if you love clay aiken you will love this cd out of all the songs on this album there were only twosongs that idid not thing were appropriate for his voice some of the songs he got to do what he does best and that was to hit the high notes very well done was happy to see it at amazon and bought it immediately hopefully his next album will be just as good,1
talent without good songs it is obvious that clay aiken has talent there is no fooling about that he is definitely one of the most talented pop stars out there right now however the people producing this album did a poor job showcasing the talent that clay aiken holds every song on this album sounds the same the emotions portrayed by clay are not very diverse every emotion fits into either the category of i am singing about pain or we are going to get through the pain the truth is that this album is painful enough to actually sit and listen to the only song on this less than quality debut that is worth listening to is the title track measure of a man this song is in a realm of its own actually having a worthwhile message in summation the talent is there the album is not maybe next time clay,0
california i am highly entertained not by this horrible music but by the marketing scam perpetrated on the music buying public over and over tell them it good a thousnad times and they will buy anything it is an admirable thing to see clive davis become even more wealthy by pumping out more and more drivel for the masses to consume a good clue to the quality of the five star reviews for this release can be found by the list of music purchases made by those who bought this cd cds from the american idol series closer josh groban the movie album barbra streisand bette midler sings the rosemary clooney songbook bette midler one heart celine dion the very best of cher cher buddy jewell buddy jewell michael buble enhanced michael bubleif lack of taste were a crime all involved with this release would be in jail,0
he is the measure of a man i love this man and please do not get me started on his voice i now can not ever imagine my life without having clay aiken in it he such a wonderful talent not only with his beautiful haunting vibrato but his whole persona he is the next elvis i can not wait to hear many more albums to come believe me i am a picky person when it comes to music i chose and i chose clay measure of a man gets an a thumbs up and a million stars,1
good but could be great first i am a huge fan of clay aiken he has a magnificent voice that i feel the powers that be tried to turn into just another pop singer i am not saying the songs are bad i am just saying some of them were not easily recognized as clay voice i would have loved more ballads with the backgrounds a little quieter so clay could shine through let us hope the next album has more of clay less pop attitude,1
measure of a man bad material do not get me wrong clay is a wonderful vocalist really truely he is a gifted singer but the big problem these days is that there are so many gifted singers who end up with horrible stale and downright creepy material has anyone actually listened to the lyrics to invisible it sounds more like a stalker than a lonely everyman and it way creepy his other songs all sound the same and in some cases are laughably silly i feel so let down i wanted so much to love this album because i love clay but it just bad hopefully next time around clay gets himself more worthy material because if he continues down this path he will end up forgotten please better material,0
marketing machine wolf wearing sheep skin ok people i like pop music i do i like good produced pop music even if artist is commercial this cd is no different than pink or britney cd as mr clay is claiming to be different that is he said people are tired of fake pop stars well to tell you the truth he is no different it is marketing machine that is trying to tell people how he is so like you ordinary and all nice so you could buy his cd well that do not matter too much to me if the music is good but this cd ai not nothing special ordinary power ballads with cheap lyrics i also have message for clay kid good job with stories about how you are so different than justin and pink american public eats them for lunch and please now that you have money get someone else to write you album because this one sucks,0
great voice lousy material this album is a major disappointment because clay aiken has so much promise as an entertainer his charisma and talent so evident on american idol are noticeably missing on this album of mediocre songs the title alone was a bad choice kevin sharp also released a measure of a man in the NUMBER s and was much more deserving to use it since he was battling cancer at the time of its recording and this collection of forgettable tracks will not give clay the staying power he will need to stay afloat in the cutthroat entertainment world please american idol you got them through the door but that means nothing if they can not stay there bad album from a bright talent,0
great singer wrong material the clive davis churned out anothere same ol same ol like what david foster did to josh groban great voices with little to do the singer can be great but if the material is mostly wrong oh well i will hope for better next time,0
changed my life these recordings deeply affected me even more so than the works of the johnny mathis,1
NUMBER stars for the voice NUMBER for the songs i would expect no less than great singing and clay does not disappoint his voice is just gorgeous his singing delivery and the cd production are all terrific my one complaint has more to do with music today than with clay can not anyone write a good up tempo melody these days some of these songs are just boring but then again i find that to be the case with most of what on the radio nowadays everything is either slow and boring or fast and insipid my favorite clay moments from american idol were when he sang faster songs billy joel grease buttercup so i know he can definitely sing uptempo songs i just hope he does on the next album,1
clay fan clay aikens new cd is wonderful better than i had expecited his voice lift my spirit up i am a die heart elvis fan just wating for some one to like as much i think i have found him,1
i love it when i first listened to the way i loved it instantly it the kind of song you can sing along with hearing it for the first time it is very catchy and very romantic i think this should be his next single their will be some that do not like it because its not edgy enough who cares i am sick of the negative reviews if they want to have edge and profanity in their music there are plenty of other artists out there to choose from sorry for going off there anyway i love the way and i also really really like touch overall i love the entire cd i am going to play it until i memorize every word,1
i am sorry i am sorry for everyone out there who actually spent their money on clay cd i am amazed that clay even made it to the top ten on american idol i think that the only people that voted for him were people that thought he was cute personally i think he is a disgrace to the north carolina name in conclusion the only reason i give this cd one star is because you can not give a cd zero stars if i could give it zero stars i would,0
crawling under a rock to spare my ears the agony ugh from the fake smile on his cd single to the barry manilow ish album cover this guy screams superficiality sorry clay you might have been second in american idol ii but you are not barry manilow i just have a problem with someone who has to use a tv show to get noticed instead of using their god given talents and merits to get to superstardom it smacks in the face of those who have real talent and are struggling to be heard and appreciated by the music industry and the public so many good singers are passed up because of tripe like this please spend your money wisely and do not buy this cd go out and get yourself ultimate barry manilow or even a good celine dion disc instead at least those folks worked for years to get where they are and obviously have some talent clay i wish you luck but i am sure your career will be history in about a year,0
measure of a man cd is the best do not listen to that negative uncalled for review by f faulkner f f he does not know what he is talking about he just came to stir up trouble because he is jealous rude and ignorant let me clean up this board clay aiken voice is outstanding and is like no other measure of a man cd is exciting and is the best debut cd by a male musical artist in the past NUMBER years clay aiken is america idol because of his irresistable voice and character and his many many fans please buy this cd you will not be disappointed at all the songs are very good,1
the real american idol this is the real american idol clay fantastic voice is showcased fabulously on almost all of these tracks a must have for all american idol fans but this cd is appealing to everyone NUMBER of these songs are great i wish solitaire would have been included but it will be on his next single finally a singer with talent,1
superb clay aiken debut i was not sure what to think i tried to stay away from american idol records but when i heard invisible on the radio my resolve melted and i purchased the cd and i am very glad i did clay has a beautiful powerful voice unlike some artists out there he truly talented he puts his heart and soul into each and every song there is not one song on this that i hate once he draws you in you will not let go no offense to ruben fans but i believe clay should have won the contest i could not recommend this cd any higher i believe clay will be around for a long time to come,1
clay fan from miami this if for the music fan from washington stateif anyone has poopy for brains it is you my mother always said if you can not say something niceabout somebody do not say anything at all clay has a great voice and a wonderful cd and is a nicerespectul person you should take some lessons from him,1
clay is invisible on this cd clay is a true talent and i am sure he will grow mature into a great singer but this cd is full of pop fluff there are no show stopping numbers to be found here clay is not a pop star he should be in a westend or broadway show delivering show stopping number after number and as one reviewer said that even solitaire was not included which is one pop song that did show his true range and talent as for the american idol creators we are slowing seeing each of these winners fade into oblivion and even clay says it on his new cd that with this effort he is invisible,0
yay i fell in love with clay voice when he sang open arms on american idol it was so touching and i never understood whynone of my friends liked him they liked ruben instead nobody thought clay would ever make it far and look at him now he has the best voice and his cd is awesome i highly reccomend the songs invisible the way when you say you love me and this is the night i especially like when you say you love me because clay is not as good at uptempo songs but he nailed this one i program my cd player to play this song over and over all of the songs on this cd are awesome and i know you will love it,1
excellent NUMBER stars plus excellent voice excellent lyrics excellent music this cd has is all every track on this cd shows clay aiken pure and natural talent this cd has not been out of my cd player since its release date oct NUMBER i listen to it everyday finally with all the gimmacks that other pop artists try to pass off as talent there is a young man that has talent a gift to us all a truly beautiful voice clay fills the void of what is missing in today music a real singer and he does it so well its a shame that i could only give it NUMBER stars because its so much better than that clay is a keeper with the talent to be around for a long time,1
well done i have not liked much recent american pop but clay sure is a good singer i watched him perform invisible on the billboard awards i was completely blown away simply amazing a friend had also sent me his this is the night bridge over troubled water single earlier this year amazing as well good work clay hope your future albums are excellent as well,1
amazing clay aiken does it again from the first time i heard clay sing i was a fan i voted for him when he was on american idol a lot more then once let me tell you and now i am even obsessed with him i was so excited when clay album came out i love each song on the album and listen to every one evey day almost there have been a lot of bad reviews and i am not going to get mad because that is their own oppinion but i really do not know what they are talking about maybe they are listening to a different cd or something because this album is amazing his voice could have been showed off more but on a couple of songs it really is showed off like in perfect day i think a lot of people would love this cd,1
nothing out of the ordinary this man really does have a great voice do not get me wrong but i do not think this is an album that people should waste there money on yes i am a fan of josh groban but this is not what the deal is about i just think that this cd has some crappy songs with crappy lyrics i mean is about clay wanting to watch me in my room that kind of freaks me out i do not want some guy on my wall watching me ge undressed clay got on american idol to become the famous person that he is if it was not for that show then he would still be a nobody teacher he has a normal voice nothing that someone in a church choir does not have i think that if you are going to blow your money on real music then you should buy josh groban yea he does sing in different languages but if you translate them they have great meanings and you can even get addicted to italian at least josh can speak another language heh,0
when a good voice meets bad music this album is a complete waste of clay voice all i can say is it reminds me of a watered down mix of bad air supply meets bad barry manilow i can not understand what motivates these outstanding reviews for a album that not worthy of them these songs are about exciting as muzak except if clay music was playing in elevators i would be forced to take the stairs i hope by the next release clay has the music to complement his voice,0
listen to it again being a NUMBER year old male i am probably not the typical clay aiken fan as with many the first time i heard the album i was disappointed very disappointed after i listened to it a couple more times it started to grow on me now i think its actually very well done and clay vocals on the album are absolutely incredible for those who were unimpressed with the album i encourage you to listen to it again maybe even twice if you still do not like it fine shelf it but i think you will find it will grow on you it seems a lot of people had a similar experience the more they listened the more they liked it i have also noticed that reviews written within the first few days after the release have been much more negative than those written a week or two later so listen to it again,1
it hurts it hurts to see clay fall like this the momentum leading up to the cd release was so great that it only leads to disappointment it not clay fault i blame it on the media and hype surrounding the release that clay could not do anything but fail please do not waste your hard earned money on this trash josh grobin cd is much more satisfying,0
eventually measures up while i wanted to love this cd i think clay is the greatest example of the american can do philosophy and a decent human being to boot i was disappointed when i first listened other than this is the night the only track to wow me was i survived you but since i wanted to love it and i had paid good money for the thing i kept listening then i fell and i mean hard i do love this cd no it is not the greatest musical production ever in fact i think it is overproduced clay voice sings for itself it needs less help not more but it is a fine start to a career that will cross many medias i would love to see aiken on broadway mr cowell and we will watch with wonder at the good this great man will do with his life and his time of fame he is a performer worth supporting and encouraging you go clay,1
fresh sound clay has made many of us get back into the album buying mode i think this new release is great in every aspect i too would like to see neil sedaka produce him that aside the critics who tell us we can not like him are pushing us right into his arms,1
not a five star rating i am very surprised at the NUMBER starspeople are giving this cd pleasedo not waste your money clay wasokay on ai NUMBER but this new cd justshowcase his talents hopefullynext one will be better i will haveto give this one two thumbs down,0
disappointed but still a fan can not hide my disappointment with this cd i was looking forward to it especially after attending the idol concert in raleigh unfortunately on this cd clay is overpowered by background singers there is also no diversity most of the songs sound the same to me as an older fan i was hoping for some classic numbers like those clay sang on the tv series i will not be listening to this cd again hopefully whoever is responsible for it will learn from the experience and can produce something which will let clay shine and reach out to his entire audience on his next cd,0
really bad that a bad star for clay aiken this c d is really borring and all the songs sound the same one listen of this album is enought to say do not waste your money into this c d really peace of nothing,0
does not measure up this cd is a huge disappointment clay has such an awesome voice and this cd does little to show off his true talent the songs are average at best and lack the kind of melodies that would truly show off clay gift i have read many reviews of this cd and the most recent stated the same it lacks any luster and will probably get lost in a pile of old cd good luck next time clay on producing some more appropriate music for your awesome voice,0
nice guy and great voice but i liked him better on american idol i am glad that others like it his cd and that he doing really well on the charts,0
not what i expected i waited in anticipation for the release of this album i think it awful with the exception of two tracks measure of a man and this is the night the background music is far too loud and drowns out clay most of the time it sounds like he is shouting to be heard above the music the wonderful voice we heard on american idol is certainly not evident on this cd the lack of ballads is disappointing he certainly not cut out to be the next rock star please do not try to portray him as such,0
clay aiken is the best i fell in love with him when he first auditioned on american idol NUMBER i was praying for him the whole way through and was disappointed when he lost to ruben but his sales prove that he should have been the american idol i bought his cd the second day it came out i had been waiting for it for so long and i was not disappointed at all he sounds wonderful and it feels as if he singing only to you if you have a good ear and know good music when you hear it this cd is for you there are not many good singers left so i am thankful he blessed with this gift,1
why i hate potato chips actually i love potato chips this just plain sucks what is wrong with you people must you follow and do everything a reality show tells you to do and this guy supposeldy freakin lost there something wrong here folks when society is reduced this low and forget such classics and beethoven and mozart concertos classic rock like floyd or zepplin even modern music like dream theater and nightwish there is something wrong with american society just like with potato chips you do not know when the frell to stop,0
decent tunes i am not really into pop music i really like rap and r b but i can really dig a great voice so what can i say clay aiken got a real good voice soul power and range the songs are a bit predictable and not very challenging but the dude aiken racks up all the songs touch is a good song proving that aiken should explore hip hop a little when you say you love me has a country sound to it i do not like country music i did not like this song either but it got itself on in my head for hours i did like invincible clay can really shake it up he displays his impressive range in run to me and measure of man perfect day and no more sad songs have a rock edge the way and shine and run to me are soulful ballads i liked aiken voice better than the songs hopefully he picks some better song writers next time,1
clay is da bomb this cd showcases clay talent beautifully he sounds fantastic i think his music will appeal to a wide range of people i am very proud of clay aiken he has stayed true to himself thats refreshing way to go clay,1
amazing this is an amazing cd this mans voice is incredable there is not one song that i dislike i loved his performances on american idol but this cd shows more of what he can do all you clay fans are in for something great can not say much more buy it and see for yourself,1
it is all about the voice clay aiken voice stands out more than any other singer i have listened to it inspires makes you feel good excites and is just nice to listen to i can put his of a man cd and listen to every song again again very rare for albums now a days to have every song enjoyable NUMBER invisible up tempo pop catchy and very enjoyable NUMBER i will carry you emotional make you feel good ballad NUMBER the way again emotional make you feel good ballad NUMBER when you say you love me easy listening country ballad NUMBER no more sad songs good ballad great main chorus NUMBER run to me strong ballad NUMBER shine nice listening ballad clay sounds very caring NUMBER i survived you strong ballad NUMBER this is the night his trademark awesome ballad NUMBER perfect day up tempo ballad very good NUMBER measure of a man powerful ballad very emotional NUMBER touch up tempo very good a must have cd i can not wait until his next cd,1
measure of a man i love love love this cd very much clay aiken vocals are perfect and sings so well clay aiken deserves a whole lot more radio airplay,1
skydivergirl love it love it love it i have listened to this cd since it came out on NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER clay aiken has a magical voice that pulls you in all the songs are good and the outstanding songs in my opinion are the way touch and when you say you love me it is refreshing for an entertainer to have the morals and committments that clay aiken has i find myself singing along to the music not that you want to hear me singing god bless mr aiken in his future endeavors i for one have been thrilled with the music and will continue buying anything mr aiken releases go clay do not let the nasties get you down there are a lot of fans that just want to hear you sing,1
clay you have an amazing gift i loved your album i am extremely proud of you clay your album is everything i expected and more i was very impressed with your songs and always with your amazing and beautiful voice god has truly blessed you with a gift and a beautiful soul i am proud to shout to the world i am a clay aiken fan and he is my american idol keep up your good work in all that you do you are an amazing person i look forward to all of your albums,1
does not do it i have honestly heard this entire album i am glad that i did not buy it everything sounds almost the same and i find myself getting bored with his voice i am a big fan of everyone on ai so i listen to every song first before i judge i would say kelly clarkson and ruben studdard cd are better than this please do yourself a favor and buy those instead not this i would recommend maybe downloading some of clay songs but do not spend your money,0
yawner my thrifty stingy friend who not even throw away month old newspapers gave me this cd and told me i could keep it i should have been suspicious of this unexpected generosity my hunch was right on every song sounds the same stale corny and sleep inducing i rather re read month old newspapers unless i have trouble sleeping then i will whip out the cd and i know i will fall asleep within NUMBER songs or faster,0
clay shines i was not sure how i would react to this cd it not the usual style of music i listen to but i love clay aiken voice i was pleasantly surprised this cd rocks my favorite song is shine i can not get it out of my head i also love measure of a man and i survived you yay clay,1
let the revolution begin after the massive success of clay aiken first single this is the night the expectations were high for his debut album luckily aiken does not disappoint from the catchy up tempo single invisible to the touching and emotive title track measure of a man this cd provides a fantastic balance of lyrical depth and impressive vocal range while some think his powerful voice is better suited for broadway this impeccable debut cd proves that clay has the capability of being a phenomenal recording artist in an industry full of sell outs and talentless clones it refreshing to experience an artist as gifted and genuine as clay aiken,1
one of the best albums ever since the moment i heard clay on american idol NUMBER i have loved his voice this album shows just what this youg man can do he can sing the songs are powerful and sung to perfection by clay every song is really great and you will definitely listen to this album over and over i do not see how anyone could not like it it just that good this is one of the greatest if not the grestest pop album of all time clay made a masterpiece,1
excellent cd with catchy songs this cd is one of very few that i own that i listen to the entire cd i enjoy each song on the album and i find myself constantly singing along i highly recommend this cd,1
award winner and very deserving of it no wonder this man won an american music award a billboard music award and his single and album went platinum and double platinum i bought this cd because i liked invisible because of billboard saying it the best pop cd of NUMBER and because i figured he must be good if he won awards i was so glad i bought it after i heard it what a great album it so nice to hear someone with a great voice singing material that not filled with the nonsense that is on so many cds today this is real music,1
not thrilled i watched each week to hear this beautiful voice on american idol and waited for this cd to be released i took it home played it once and it is now in the stack to be traded in how disappionting maybe i expected too much i do not like the songs sorry,0
this album deserves negative NUMBER stars why would any lucid human being waste their money buying this junk this isnt music this is contrived and manufactured i do not watch american idol and i never would because it a awful t v show that degenarates everything good about music the only people who buy this are clueless teenaged girls who know zilch about music and and middle aged woman who buy this for their kids to torture them way too sappy way too bland this is safe music for people afraid to listen to music that takes risks and challenges them intellectually clay aiken should stop covering songs from the beatles and simon and garfunkel he destroying those classics with his broadwayesque voice the beatles were actual artists who took risks in music and were innovative clay is nothing like that just another talentless popstar getting his NUMBER minutes of fame and then will fade away into oblivion the sooner the better,0
if i could have given this cd a zero i am not a hard person to please but this cd makes me want to vomit if you are looking for NUMBER songs that sound the same then this is your cd if you are looking for something with a little variety look elsewhere i am a huge fan of clay but was very disappointed with this cd if you have heard one of the songs you have pretty much heard them all,0
not worth buying this style is for broadway the songs are blend he will not last making those type of songs,0
clay should have won ai clay aiken is the reason i enjoyed the second season of ai so much his voice is so pure and strong it almost like listening to an angel sing it is apparent that he has such a big heart and he puts so much feeling into his songs it does not matter what he sings he does an outstanding job i bought his album and i have to say i think its the best first album of any american idol thus far any song he sings that broadcasts his voice range just awes me anybody that does not think this young man is talented needs to have their hearing checked he is spectacular in my opinion clay should have won ai hands down definitely an album worth owning,1
this album is not as good as they make it seem only claymates like it and his fans are buying his way mr aiken has a large internet fan base who are purchasing multiples to boost his sales to make the album appear to be great however they have to beg radio to play it here is a response from a radio station quote as of right now we have no plans to add invisible to our playlist interest in the song is strictly limited to fans of clay aiken people outside the claymate realm really are not that into the song the video is not even getting substantial play on mtv or vh NUMBER you may want to try our sister station the song has more of an adult contemporary feel to it good luck end of quotedo not believe all the five star reviews of this album if you want true reviews of this album read the NUMBER to NUMBER star reviews and you will get a fair assessment of what it really is about the other reviews are all hype with no substance,0
what a cutie when i think of clay the first phrase that comes to mind is awwwwwww he is just so cute and for once he a cutie who can actually sing his voice is tremendous and his songs showcase his voice well i was a faithful idol NUMBER viewer and rooted for clay from day NUMBER i am delighted to see how much he has grown as an artist ruben who and how he has overpowered all of the other idols in popularity album sales and tv appearances my only complaint is the lack of song variety there a point where all of the songs start to sound the same and the only reason that you keep on listening is because well it clay he my favorite idol,1
the music is back people who have appreciated real music for decades finally get to relive the experience through the measure of a man cd the crystal clearness unspoiled beauty perfect pitch and power of clay aiken voice is matched by the feeling he puts into every phrase i am so impressed with this cd and as much as i love each song i am blown away by perfect day,1
great album this is an album that i will listen to again and again wonderful songs sung by a great voice touch i will carry you and invisible are my faves pop music at its best,1
awesome again clay once again suprises me i have listened to this cd thinking how could he be better he is clay voice range his use of his god given talent is astounding all the songs are wonderful especially invisible and measure of a man he gets better and better and i hope he has a long wonderful journey ahead i would recommend this cd to everyone what a great addition to every music library,1
whats going on i do not like this music at all maybe its just me and if you like this then you probably really think its just me but all music sounds the same well most bands not all but its just trash that we listen to and then after a few years you never listen to it i do not know i do not have his cd and i am not going to get it you can if you want to but i like things that are original,0
measyre of a man awesome congrats clay this is an awesome album way to go clay we have waited for months for this album and now that it is here we are all learning the words and singing right along with clay can not wait to see him in concert and hear more songs from this amazing young man he thrills all ages what an amazing ambassador you have clay is also our american idol in canada as well please come here on your concert tour too,1
blown away this is truly the best cd that i have bought in a very long time i followed clay aiken all through ai NUMBER loved the first single was a little worried about the debut cd i was so blown away by the songs his voice and the fact that his character comes through every song what an incredible way to start a career i am anxiously awating the next cd that he puts out thanks clay you have shown us that singing is still alive,1
sublime voice songs do not always measure up clay voice soars to new territory on this cd particularly on songs like touch and run to me and invisible which could otherwise be categorized as ho hum pop music if clay was not singing them the lyrics are a little corny but clay makes them sound sincere the vocal range of most of these songs is not very great and thus they do not properly show off clay unique tenor to die for voice i wish that the experts who molded some of these songs would have kept their involvement in the project to a minimum and left the songs pure instead of processing them with pop synthesizer sounds i can hear that on any modern day pop album and it is not very special on the other hand i can only hear clay voice on a few cd and his true voice is great enough that it should not be crowded by synthesizer warble,1
big disappointment bought it and was a bit disappointed i thinkthat clay should stick to his own style andstop trying to be someone he not the songsjust did not do it for me certainly not the clay aiken that sold platinumwith his first cd wonder how that happened spend your money of something worth while butif you just got to have it burn yourself acopy from a clay fanatic who is sure to havea few extras on hand,0
awesome i fell in love with clay the first day he auditioned on ai he is not only adorable he as a awesome voice girls are crazy over him and this cd is soo great it beautiful i love clay soo much and if u say that you can not stand him then why are you wasting time reviewing over him jelousy keep it up claymates he has already gone double platinum woowoo,0
clay is such a joke he might start rapping on his next cd and chances are you might hear him ruben and pharrell do a joint together anyway clay an okay singer but ruben was better too bad they got rid of frenchie davis to quote funkadelic the girl is bad,0
love it i just love this cd after i got the cd i must have played it over and over for days there is not a song that is not great everything is sung with such heart i think clay aiken is the best thing to happen to pop music in a long time no gimmicks just pure talent,1
the best cd i have ever heard this cd sent chills down my spine clay aiken is a very gifted vocalist,1
teen titan tower falls apart this toy is absolutely terrible i gave it one star only because zero is not an option my son really wanted this toy and when he got it he played with it for about NUMBER minutes and walked away even a four year old can see how lame this toy is it comes with a trigger that is supposed to eject some kind of orange ramp to launch a car nice concept except the thing does not come out all the way so my son ends up pulling the thing out there are missiles that are supposed to attach to the side according to the instructions they do not the tower keeps falling off of it all around i can not believe how poorly designed this toy is for the money you would think i bought it at the dollar store or something i would urge all who consider buying this toy to talk your kid into something else it terrible,0
ok toy i have to agree with alot of the other posts on this one santa brought this for my daughter who loves teen titans for christmas the instructions what there is of them is very hard to decipher the orange launch thing would not work and i had to take apart the little red switch that the control thing fits on to make the organge track pop out the red switch was not in the right position from factory even then the orange track does not fold all the way out also like alot of other reviewers the tower tips over very easily i just do not feel like i am getting what i am paying for these days when it comes to toys,0
good stuff i take this daily and it seems to have assisted with my acne and other health complaints a higher dose helped considerably with the common cold along with taking vitamin c and garlic the extra immune system boost helped me get over it within NUMBER days as opposed to the usual NUMBER with garlic c i cut one vcap open to help with a cystic acne spot that was bothering me i rubbed the oregano ointment on the skin let it sit overnight covered with a bandage and the spot had shrunk considerably by morning is this the placebo effect in action perhaps but i do not see the harm in using it if this is the case at least it seems to help,1
not worth it listen to the other reviews this book is just an encyclopedia of waste at least an encyclopedia has pictures and examples this book has neither after the first NUMBER chapters it all downhill it is a very frustrating read because there are absolutely no examples it all theory do not waste your money and do not listen to all the fancy quotes on the book back cover this book just does not cut it,0
car parts struts for java this book is a complete waste of time i had been very skeptical of the technology being only a short cut for java web hacks and script kittys and i was unfortunately right those that can explain how jsp can not truely conform to the mvc methodology should really read this book it would serve them right reading this boring drivel instead of actually learning the core j NUMBER ee web framework ted husted should be beaten with this book or an actual car strut i love most of tools that come out of the jakarta project but here is a suggestion learn and know each of the tools suggested for mvc impletementations and skip the gimmic tools like struts turbine and velocity in the event you do buy this book please consider it many other uses i know for me it has been instrumental for leveling my air conditioner,0
non working battery the watch is in perfect condition but can not set the time and it keeps going dead i thought it was a new watch but acts like a used watch i will not order from this vendow again,0
don t listen to the review this album jams yes it is old school influenced but it is a lot catchy fresh techno pop jam,1
works fine but expensive the filter works fine and i was about to order another i paid NUMBER NUMBER for it NUMBER months ago and now it is almost NUMBER i mean we all expect to pay a little more when we buy items later on but more than NUMBER times as much,0
special waste of time this movie is for you if a you are over NUMBER and still read comic books b believe that someone would believe that taking a blue pill would make them a superman c then spend their life trying to enact their powers contrary to all reality telling them otherwise d find humor in the situations that people with reduced mental functioning find themselves e and do not know that unless distorted the reality of such individuals is too mundane for a movie f and that some cheaply made movies are not made to convey an altruistic message but to make money,0
hystericly funny thought this film was very funny well done acting was great directing was gritty but worked well for this movie and it story would highly recommend if you like dark comedies,1
better than i thought i would consider myself a radio damn yankees fan having only heard their radio hits like do not tread on me and high enough after hearing this essentials cd though i see that there more than meet the ear the only song on here that i can not seem to get into is come again but all the others are real rockers for me from the milder silent is broken to the fast and heavy piledriver this cd never stops the guitars vocals bass and drums all rock i tend to give conservative ratings so that why i gave this a NUMBER out of NUMBER stars but otherwise i would highly recommend it for any other radio fans like myself,1
do not be deceived this version of beowulf should not be compared at all to the original text of beowulf students should not be taught that this story as re created by robert nye is reflective of the beowulf written about NUMBER ad the story developed and shared for hundreds of years is characterized by christian concepts and ideals this version written by robert nye reflects our societies overwhelming desire to rewrite history de christianizing it as they go along robert nye has replaced the christian god of the original beowulf with the mythological viking god odin the original beowulf tale supports the historical significance that christian beliefs and ideas had on the overall society of england and throughout europe robert nye has done a great injustice in adjusting an historical document to reflect his own convictions or lack thereof,0
creative action all over this book is almost all actoin about a man who is a very strong and kind warrior he knows that the goodness inside of him can defeat any evil he uses that knowlage to kill monsters the book is a little confusing at times but everything elese is very creative and understandable i would sugjest this book to NUMBER year old and up for the concern of some grusome scense it is only NUMBER pages a good lengh for a bed side book by the way beowulf is the guy on the horse not the monster on the cover,1
chaka powerhouse vocals when this lp came out in NUMBER a billboard ad stated most powerful instrument in music returns and it did this chaka lp is one of her best and it shows how to use power vocals correctly i think this lp was ahead of it time a great fusion of r b funk jazz arif mardin knew what to do with khan voice NUMBER powerful examples of why chaka khan is one of the greatest singers ever i have this on vinyl cd,1
huxley it ai not i am afraid that i must agree with the comments of below apart from a wonderful idea for the theme of this novel eastern religion meets western technology their was not enough character or plot development to sustain my interest past the half way mark this book has been praised as an influence by some very great authors but i must assume it was the theme and not the narrative itself that caught their fancy the narative reads like a poor translation really bad style a few funny moments but overall a very dissapointing book for me considering it high falutin reputation i will stick with huxley if and when i seek enlightenment,0
through the madness first of all ike is doing the very thing that tina always said he would do ike turner will never admit to what he did to tina tina stayed around him for so long because she promised that she would never leave him like all the others ike took advantage of her tina her self said she cared very much for him cher even had seen what was going on and tried to convince tina to leave him even the girls that danced with tina on stage had whitnessed what happened tina did not write her autobiography to promote her career she herself said that she did not want to talk about what happened but the public kept asking her what had went on so she released her autobiography in NUMBER well after her come back in NUMBER while ike can try to deny it all he wants the truth is he violently abused tina and considering the person ike turner is i would expect him to do no less than to lie and make a pathetic excusse of a come back,0
works i have been taking these for NUMBER months i do not love taking NUMBER tabs a day but they seem to work best when you do the price is better then some of the other products on the market also,1
even creepier than you thought what most amazing is the tape recording of his final speech to convince all the parents to begin giving their children poison only one headstrong black woman speaks up with a speech that these babies deserve to live sadly the interviewer just lets the survivors ramble when most seem quite willing to answer tough follow up questions it needed at least another hour,1
buen producto esta excelente el producto es tal como lo esperaba y bueno por supuesto el servicio de entrega fue inmediato,1
only useful as a backup to snell and weightman if a textbook for hindi must use some romanistion then it should use the same system as r s mcgregors oxford hindi english dictionary as teach yourself hindi does the authors of that title r snell s weightman teach hindi at london university school of oriental and african studies further this textbook relegates the devanagari script to the rear of the book and includes no devanagari at all for the tape dialogues as a final black mark the standard reached in the course is way short of snell weightmann this is partly a product of having NUMBER lessons instead of NUMBER recommendation get snell weightmann and then mcgregor dictionary and grammar use bhatia if you need extra tape practice,0
yancey has another one i have read all philip yancey books he gives an intellegent amazing insight of the true religious life demonstrated in the bible this provides a person the detailed readings therein its relationship to everyday life experiences all is in proper perspective it also an excellent tool for bible study i have it in printed book form also on my e reader do not leave home without it,1
the paradise war book i was very pleased at how quickly i received my purchase it was for a gift and i tend to be a procrastinator at getting things,1
good show but terrible packaging the other reviews cover the show well so i will not go into that but i do want to warn you that the dvd case is really cheap with the dvds doubled up in the same slot for the sake of NUMBER cents cost to them they have produced something that is very likely to scratch your dvds,0
the sanctuary i like this show but then again i like sy fi amanda tapping is a good actress enjoyed her in stargate sg NUMBER and in the show sanctuary she does a great english imitation,1
sanctuary season NUMBER fail after enjoying the first series of sanctuary i have recently purchased the second season looking forward to the continuation of some good story lines i have been incredibly let down the first season had some effects but somehow they have deteriorated into something even worse there is very poor interaction between animations and cast i could perhaps forgive this if there was something else good about the series unfortunately they have really destroyed what was a good series i have watched NUMBER episodes and am unsure i will watch any more the acting is poor the storyline is worse the new characters are uninspired and i have no motivation to watch any more as its definitely not getting any better if you enjoyed the first series you are better off leaving it there and not ruining the series by watching this series you have been warned,0
temperature displayed is incorrect the accuracy of this thermometer is really poor i returned the thermometer for an exchange from amazon the replacement has same problem i did calibrate it still it shows wrong temperature i liked ease of mounting on the window and size but completely useless as fas as what value it shows for the temperature,0

if you loved the first outbreak you will love this one something to always look foward to in a sequal is the gameplay you loved from the first that the great thing about outbreak NUMBER it has the same controls but this time you can choose who you want to play with you for instance if david does not work well with kevin but works well with jim then you can choose jim as your partner plus you can walk as you shoot the only downside is that theres not going to be a outbreak file NUMBER,1
boring the new resident evil outbreak is boring i expected it to be action packed boy was i wrong every level has like NUMBER zombies i rented the game to shoot zombies not infected animals my advice try it at a friends house or play a demo first,0
i did it so anyone can i am a grandmother with no woodworking experience i made the foolish decison to put up large crown moulding in my bedroom and got hopelessly stuck at the inside and outside corners i looked for help on the net and found this book three days later i finished the job and the corners were absolutely perfect the directions are written and illustrated so that anyone can follow them i have more trouble making a souffle than i had working with crown moulding thanks to this book it should be in everyone do it yourselfers library by the way i saved a fortune doing this project myself,1
good book presumably in either edition my daughter almost NUMBER enjoyed this book from the library last halloween we are looking forward to reading it again this halloween i loved introducing her to halloween from a book that emphasized friendship and generosity among neighbors rather than scary monsters pranks or candy the illustrations were lovely i am sure the original edition had beautiful illustrations too and the previous reviewer might have been chagrinned by the changes to a personal childhood favorite but i am guessing that most people who like my family discover the story for the the first time in this edition will find nothing amiss,1
the worst of kirk whalum kirk whalum is a fantastic saxophonist but this one is a disaster it does not deserve a mention let alone a place in the collection of true jazz lovers please do not judge whalum by this cd i recommend instead,0
worst dress shirts thin cloth and not professional at all i did not knew that amazon had such a poor quality control and also they do not have any control over other vendors save NUMBER by not buying this product very thin and very large sized shirts they are see thru and look no where like they are shown on web site,0
horrible product this shirt is absolutely the worst in the market the fabric is cheap so cheap that i threw the darn thing away,0
shirt in picture is not what they send you first off the shirts are good they are thin but they look good the collar tips have built in plastic strips to keep them pointed and crisp they come out of the dryer pretty good w o wrinkles if you use the wrinkle guard cycle however the shirt in the picture is not at all what they send you the shirt in this pic above has a much tougher textured material and the actual shirt has a white label not black as in the pic so expect a very thin smooth untextured but stylish shirt with crisp collars that look good that comes out of the dryer nice but the shirt in the pic is not the shirt you get,1
good buy with reservations of course the list price is a joke however for the price the quality is quite good it uses thin material but is fine for summer it is about NUMBER NUMBER size larger than most brands so you might want to go for the smaller sizes just remember this is not your NUMBER deparment store shirt and yes only the blue colors look good,1
very thin flimsy if you want a cheap thin shirt that likely will not last a dozen washing then this is the shirt for you be aware that amazon has a NUMBER NUMBER plus NUMBER NUMBER per item return shipping fee is all bill blass stuff this quality,0
poor quality i bought this shirt for one reason the price and i soon as i open the box i found out why it was so cheap because of the cheap materials save your money spend couple of dollars more and you will be happier with quality,0
smack the editors as mentioned by other reviewers this dvd is just horrible to watch because of the absurd amount that the cameras cut away to another scene every few seconds if you want to watch a guitar solo or anything else for that matter to absorb any details forget it the editor s did not do the scorpions justice the music is good but since this is a dvd and not a cd i am giving two stars for the spazoid video technique,0
a clas sick that made me sick this book was very boring very few moments in the book are actually exciting and they are few and far between the beginning of the book is the best part it spent too much time explaining and describing images i felt like the whole book could be cut in half and you would still get the majority of the story across to the readers,0
interesting but repetative while reading this book i was extremely fascinated and into it in the beginning but as the book goes on the main character continues to classify underwater creatures over and over and over the only thing that kept me reading until the end was the mystery of captain nemo which i have to say was never really revealed and a bit disapointing ending so all together and very detailed and interesting book but too slow and boring overall,0
oldie but a goodie i have seen the movie needs to be remade wih today special effects come on disney and really enjoyed the book,1
a disappointing read for the NUMBER st century this book is a classic no question that why i chose to read it when it came out in the NUMBER s it was science fiction and gripped the imaginations of many a ship that could travel under the water but reading it in NUMBER much of the novelty of the book has been realized we have had submarines for nearly a century but even aside from that there is little plot to the novel it reads as if it were written by a committee at national geographic it a survey of all the unique items and places in the world oceans the little plot there is involves the protagonist trying to escape from the ship and the ending not to ruin it is a total cop out and disappointing i was hoping this book would stand the test of time like the time machine or even around the world in NUMBER days but i found it a rather boring and drudging read,0
twenty thousand leagues a mysterious creature is haunting the seas and professor aronnax is determined to discover the origins of the beast however the encounter brings more than he ever expected as he is captured by the strange and withdrawn captain of a submarine ship and whirled around the world oceans the aquatic wonders he experiences thrill his academic soul while the actions and motivations of his host leave him questioning both the individual and civilizations at large verne underwater adventure is the latest novel i have read to my toddler at bedtime and is far from my favorite as we finished the third verne novel we have approached i found myself lamenting a brilliant story bogged down by careless prose i found that the language was flat and uninspired and the sentence structure was unbelievably choppy the failings of the writing itself took away from what would otherwise have been a book full of wonders and i believe we will leave verne buried once and for all,1
internet connection turns off all the time after a certain time the modem begins to loose the conection to internet every now and then the only solution is to constantly turn it on and off no lightning have fallen near my house nor any other extraordinary event have happened i have looked for help from zoom internet forums and my isp company and all of them agreed that it is a hardware problem apparently a common one if you buy an x NUMBER zoom modem router the only definite solution buy a new modem not a zoom modem,0
a real mess snl deserves a comprehensive overview that tells us how they put together the show and how why it matters mattered this is not that book the author simply has no objectivity so he can not tell us the truth if you want to read what you already know about the show popular sketches this is the book to read we learn almost nothing about how personalities worked together or not to make the show last this long far too little time is spent on the first NUMBER years and that first amazing cast but if you want to hear about and victoria jackson this is the book for you a real mess,0
awesome i choose this book because it was economically priced the book was kind of in rough condition on the outside cover but the inside was totally fine the description of the book was completely accurate,1
yadda yadda yadda if you took out every comment by cast writers and producers on trying unsuccessfully to figure out lorne michaels this heavy tome would easily be cut in half too much whining too little interesting historical information for me a long time fan of the show,0
lol good stuff some funny some serious but all the little stories you have never heard from behind the curtain at snl,1
narnia prince caspian it was a great choice between bd and dvd of course i bought the bd as you all know the quality is far more better than regular dvd the movie had a pretty good opening to and it was very catchy story has a pretty good plot to it but it was not as good as the first movie there were more action on the first movie compared to this all in all it was a great and fun movie to watch,1
thanks for the case i was disappointed with this seller i got an empty dvd case that was shrink wrapped the most frustrating part about it was i never received a response back from the seller after trying to get in contact over and over again there goes my hard earned cash,0
very disappointing if you enjoyed the book you will not want to watch the disney version of this movie characterization was changed a friendly dwarf became a nasty grump prince caspian and king peter had jealousy issues scenes were added that were not in the book and basically all of the best parts of the book were omitted there were battles that never took place in fact fighting was the main focus of this movie anything that had any hint of spirituality was obliterated from the movie if disney wanted to create a fantasy battle movie they should have just hired someone to write one prince caspian is definitely not the prince caspian that c s lewis wrote i will definitely not watch any more disney adaptations of narnia,0
omg omg this was terrific i was so pleased that all the actors actresses from tl tw atw came back to prince caspian it was awesome the sword fights the battles the waking of the trees reepicheep and the bits of humor mixed in here and there i loved it,1
too precious too long and too precious this second narnia film still finds the children in wartime england waiting for a train when they are abruptly called back to narnia hundreds of years after their visit from the wardrobe once again evil outsiders are threatening to overwhelm the animals and folk of narnia forests the children eventually save the day and return to the train station after heroic battles and soul searching speechifying although technically amazing the story is drawn out to a sense of boredom and the characters other than the children lack a strength and sharpness that made the first film so enjoyable it is not a film we will watch again and again as we have wardrobe,0
correction on may NUMBER th review the software mentioned on my may NUMBER th review is called avid xpress not avid express when my review was edited someone changed the spelling possibly thinking it was a typo mistake,1
easy to follow this is a quick reference or trainer use it to help scouts with their knot requirements simple diagrams take the used step by step through each knot,1
knot idiots rejoice in no way does this little card set replace books or experience but for field use for common knots especially in a stressful situation it priceless i have already needed it on so many occasions work and around the yard that i moved one of them from my bob to my small edc pouch if you are anything like me kind of knowing how to tie a specific knot can get you into more trouble than not having tied the darn thing in the first place i had to secure some items for an typhoon and boy did this thing come in handy all of my ropes and knots stayed tight unlike my usual post storm assessment of finding them untied and strung out in the yard yes you could probably make a set but these are nicely printed on credit card like material albeit a bit thinner and are really legible and handy if you have a bob this is a must have especially for those you think you need NUMBER of NUMBER cord in your bob four stars because i wish you could separate the cards for easier access,1
very cool i ordered this mainly to learn some knots this is nice to throw in the backpack and take out for a camping trip use the examples to try out some knots good product very useful,1
have not needed it yet this is pretty cool it shows you how to tie some basic knots that can come come in handy in various situations i got this so i can leave it in my go bag with NUMBER ft of some paracord,1
the wind in the willows a beautiful book with detailed descriptive lovely drawings this gift to my granddaughter was well received and she takes it to bed every night,1
inspiring a movie needs to be done about this guy do not listen to al sharpton if booker t can do what he did anyone can i give it NUMBER stars but for the style of writing at the time leaves me wanting coffee,1
the recipes sound great i look forward to trying many of the recipes and really appreciate the nutritional information however the information is based on a portion of the recipe such as NUMBER NUMBER of recipe this is really not helpful when the recipe is for a pot of soup the soup would have to be divided into NUMBER servings to get an accurate calorie count even with that drawback i know i will enjoy some of the dishes,1
one of the worst mountaineering books i have ever read factually shaky at many points pedestrian prose self aggrandizing and a page turner only for wanting to finish the awful thing what i found most offensive about this book was the author egotistical disdain for the lesser climbers of the team in fact she and her fellow leaders showed nothing but hostility to many members and they all come off as smug arrogant jerks having been on climbing expeditions before there is a great deal of stress raw feelings etc but the raw and condescending behavior of the author and trip leaders is disgusting do not even get started on their ugly american analysis of asians on denali read this book if you one day want to write a mountaineering book and this one will point to every flaw in doing so,0
laughing aloud one reader story of true hilarity and boredom defying perusal in the face of denali silliest story ever the more you know about mountaineering the funnier you will find this book there is little to like but much to laugh at in ruth ann utterly unselfconscious self portrait if this were a comic novel it would be a dead on parody of a certain strain of self glorifying mountaineering literature think nicholson baker writing into thin air from the point of view of sandy hill pittman and it starts with the twenty two word long title warning if you are not in the mood to laugh be prepared to be annoyed,0
the bittersweet summit a must read for anyone preparing to climb you will understand that mountainclimbing is not for the flippant the hurried the unprepared this extraordinary story tells of the extreme suffering endured to achieve the summit you learn about the death zone and about what happens to the body at various altitudes an excellent adventure story for both men and women,1
i was disappointed i also was really looking forward to reading this book but had to force myself to finish as a redhead i feel armed with some more knowledge about the history of redheads but was left hanging somehow i found it disjointed and it was not an enjoyable read,0
was she serious since i have a red headed daughter this sounded lioke a fun book to read i gave it up just about NUMBER NUMBER of the way through maybe it got better but i was not going to stay around to find out the author really stretched it to make her point her point maybe becasue she a redhead she wanted to be so very very special so she took a few supposed facts and made a whole concept from them come on trying to make redheads all some sort of special witches monmsters super human people was dumb and she totally dissed red headed men my husband read it through but we both quickly decided not to send it to our daughter,0
it okay i really wanted to love this moisturizer i have very fair sensitive skin and this was supposed to be one of the best bets for my skin type it also has a great high spf but alas it does not sink into my skin it does not blend well at all it leaves a terrible white residue that takes forever to rub in maybe because of the high spf i am not sure but i was definitely disappointed,0
excellent series poor dvd casing the series is excellent and faithful to the literary history surrounding the robin hood legends clannad music adds a bit of authenticity as does the use of magic and superstition and the uk setting acorn did a reasonably good job digitizing and adding subtitles to the original film colour was on the dark side but nothing that can not be adjusted the poor packaging of the set prevents me from giving it a perfect score i like the look and the folding book concept of it but the casing is made of hard plastic making it prone to chipping and difficult to remove the dvds carefully without breaking or cracking them i had a similar problem with the i spy four pack collection cases so take care to remove the dvds lest you damage them permanently you might consider alternative storage like a plastic cd envelope case considering this dvd set is not cheap aside from this i highly recommend the complete robin hood set,1
robin of sherwood picture is fuzzy not digitallly remastered also disk NUMBER had a glitch in it on the first play disk is clean over all quality is not great,1
misrepresented product the image shown is exactly what you will get it is not misrepresented on amazon the package is mis leading it clearly shows a NUMBER NUMBER mm hex nut it does not work on any glasses that have a hex nut in fact i was about read to toss it out when i went and took a dental pick and pick some plastic or parafin out of the tip of it when i finally got it to work on my costco glasses that use a star driver it contains a tiny phillips head tiny flat head and the star driver no hex nut i am going to have to order something else is not worth my time and frustration to send it back,0
every kind of comedy styling all in one film what makes this film truly great is how many different styles of comedy it has you see not only slapstick and situation based comedy but also some fabulous dialog and scare comedy i did not want to watch this movie at first thinking it be a run of the mill b w film but was amazed and immediately rewound and watched it a second time,1
one of the best readings about stats this book is a pure pleasure reading for anyone interested in statistics but wants to have a break from formulas and software in fact i would make it a must read for all citizens who are bombarded by over complicated news about all areas of our life,1
outstanding book someone once said there are three kinds of liars liars damn liars and statisticians i read this book in high school and it shaped my judgement of the news media business and advertising ever since never trust the numbers without knowing their basis and remember a statistician is the type of guy who would put his head in an oven and his feet in a bucket of ice and say that on average he felt fine,1
an entertaining primer on the validity of statistics although how to lie with statistics is a bit dated having been written in the NUMBER the principles it puts forth are still valid today if not moreso than ever and the material is delivered in clear concise and even entertaining anecdotes and illustrations how often do you hear statistics bandied about in the media or used to try to prove some special interest point of course the people quoting the figures must be right with numbers on their sides until you look at just how those numbers were arrived at this book is not truly a guide on how to lie with statistics but it is an excellent text that informs the reader both how others will lie to them using statistics and on how to interpret the validity of purported statistical data,1
clear concise and fun how to lie with statistics is a fun and informative look at the was in which statisticians try to decieve the public with misleading statistics every chapter contains plenty of real world examles that provide excellent insight into the concepts the book is a quick read only NUMBER pages and it holds the reader attention both are necessities for an educational work how to lie with statistics is perfect for the beginning statistics student or anyone who wants to learn how they can be decieved through the manipulation of numbers the reading level and math make this more appropriate for high school or college students than for younger students using three randomly selected paragraphs the mean flesch kincaid grade level was NUMBER NUMBER thus this book is excellent for sophomores or advanced freshman although the writing is a little dated NUMBER it is still clear and highly relevant overall this is a highly recommended and worthwhile read,1
an up to date primer this book is a very good primer for getting one feet wet in the world of non profit organizations while it is by no means exhaustive it is certainly broad and deep enough for anyone to run their non profit more efficiently and more ethically it covers excellent project team and board building strategies as well as nearly every type of fundraising and solicitation additionally there is good information on employing the internet for communication engagement and fundraising still a fairly new field for many appendices a c cover some very good tools and examples though the listed government grant sources in appendix d focus mainly upon the humanities and the arts valuable web sources are given for finding grants in other areas,1
sony printer not really what i wanted xxxxv xxxxx xxxx xx xxxxx xxxxx xxx xx xxx x xxxxx xxxx zzzz zzzz zzzz,0
a waste of money and tin this collection amounts to three dollar store discs jammed into a pretty package for those who prefer substance over style look elsewhere for this material which is given a pretty shoddy presentation overall disc NUMBER which was unplayable on the two dvd players i tried it on repeats the entire contents of disc NUMBER and adds the tv pilots kook tour and jerks of all trades making disc NUMBER a pointless redundancy avoid it at all costs,0
misleading you get what you pay for with this set only contains maybe an hour of classic stooge fun it may fill the gap in someones collection but mostly contains fillers and short dvds it appears to be a collection of videos that no one else wanted one full dvd is the lame three stooges cartoons if you are looking for classic stooge comedy this set contains very little,0
not what i expected a rip off the price was attractive as was the packaging the box shows curly but alas curly is not easily found in this compilation also a lot of the extra features are lame stay away from this product if you really want the three stooges buy the NUMBER volume compilation from sony instead,0
total rip off the three stooges collectors edition the box says NUMBER dvds over NUMBER hours what they do not say is that there are only NUMBER classic stooges shorts and only on the first dvd the rest of the set is crap the reamaining NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER dvds NUMBER hours are patched together bad movies and cartoons remember the really bad stooges cartoons you wouldnt even watch back in the NUMBER it is intentionaly misrepresented the packaging is first class a real eyegrabber but whats inside is junk,0
good read i read this book many yeawrs ago and decided to buy it again and read it i enjoyed it but will not read it again,1
quite possibly the scariest novel ever constructed go to a used bookstore search the internet scour the newsgroups and find this book i have never read a novel before nor since that has the power to terrify the way the late tryon does here his mastery of sentence structure alone puts him above the vast majority of horror novelists simply a sensational piece of work and a travesty that it out of print,1
chico hamilton timely cheeks grove is the hook on this cd chico has that groovy back beat and always a top notch band worth a listen big daddy,1
i hate reductionists as philosophy of science this work is very fascinating unfortunately it is permeated with rather marxist ideas which the author seems to cherish but as an incissive criticism of reductionist science especially biology it is very good,1
skillful reading this is reading a master at work pinsky wields so much skill it ridiculous reading the poems here is like listening to an intelligent old man sitting in a chair somewhere in a field giving his thoughts free rein following them where they land in my opinion the poem the figured wheel is a lyrical breath taking masterpiece,1
we must feel bad that this was our poet laureate pinsky is in love with being a poet but his poems do not mean anything to the rest of us this book is a perfect example of this we are supposed to admire him not read him and i find it a shame that this lousy work got him a luareateship,0
great i like em a lot wife thinks they are the best cereal she ever had teen daughter thinks they taste just a bit better than hamster food the others here like them enough bags are pretty small but still a good enough deal that i will buy again just too good and a unique flavor really like the pumpkin seeds in them not to,1
great resource for victorious living this is a great resource for victorious living it shows the consequences of choices each of us make in our lives and how important it is to make the right choice to live a life of true freedom and liberty it is a quick read i was fascinated with the stories shared from the beginning and had a hard time putting the book down i got copies for my family to help encourage them as they are getting ready to enter the dating stage of their lives to help them stay on course and help give them the tools to save themselves for marriage as god intended i highly recommend this book whether you are married or single,1
fine film abysmal dvd this is a fine randolph scott film unfortunately the dvd has interference on the audio channel bass heavy contemporary music as if someone was playing something through the board when the transfer was made and the print itself shows damage in places i have never encountered a major studio release with this level of audio interference thanks for caring columbia pictures,0
very nice item was just as described very nice fit does not slip down your leg and also securely holds your weapon i would definitely buy this again perfect,1

choco tacos i have to say i have not actually read this book but i feel like if you are considering giving this author a chance to influence your eternal salvation you ought to give the nice people who come knocking at your door a chance too then pray about what you have learned and decide for yourself but if you want to celebrate over choco tacos you would have to go to taco johns i used to work there and they are the ones who sell the tasty treat see other reviews for this book to understand what i am talking about,0
as a how to book this one just does not work it the truth that early mormon leaders told fanciful tales about moon men and the lost ten tribes to their kids at bedtime it seems there a difference between what a mormon leader says from the puplit as official doctrine and what they say having fun with their family it the same with anyone this book takes snippets from private journals and attempts to pass them off as official doctrine as a how to book this one just does not work a better book to buy from amazon on this subject is tinkling cymbals and sounding brass the art of telling tales about joseph smith and brigham young the collected works of hugh nibley vol NUMBER hugh nibley david j whittaker editor hardcover published NUMBER,0
horribly disappointed do not get me wrong harriet the spy was one of my all time favorite books and movies growing up i am almost NUMBER now and had always wanted to read the long secret so after re reading harriet i went to the bookstore and ordered myself a copy well at first it was not so bad but there really was not any real point to the story harriet had not matured much at all and to make matters worse really offensive and hostile notes were left all over the place i am also a christian and find it offensive that the phrase jesus hates you should be allowed to be published in a children book this is especially true in this day and age when almost any threat has the potential to turn violent skip this one,0
the long secret just did not like this book it seem to be crude and it really a book for girls only,0
good for smaller bows this product is light in weight and good for smaller non parralel limb bows i have a mathews reezen and it was too small amazon has a great return policy and traded for plano max xt,1
presents a way of devotion to jesus and mary this book presents a marian version of the traditional greek orthodox jesus prayer instead of lord jesus christ son of the living god have mercy on me a sinner sister reveals that jesus has told her to constantly repeat the phrase jesus mary i love you save souls while on the surface the prayer is very simple it is difficult in practice because of the requirements of purity of mind intense desire and continuous repetition sister says that jesus finds the prayer most pleasing of great benefit to all souls living and deceased and with the help of grace can be done by anyone this is a method of prayer for the littlest ones of all ages,1
yuck i returned this product the legs were too big and the waist too small i looked like i was in a strait jacket i have the high back waist cincher and am pleased with it other than the rubber smell i can not elimate but this product sucks,0
a very real book leaving the issues for apostates and apologists to bicker over this book simply looks at the lives of people actually in the church what they do in their normal every day lives i especially liked the depictions of latter day saints in nations outside the united states including the temple trip down the amazon and a few shots of victoria peak beliver or no these pictures tell NUMBER NUMBER words about a people that are industrious optimistic and compassionate these photos aver that while many continue to criticize and ostracize this church the latter day saints frequently hold the moral ethical highground on their idealogical opponents how many other NUMBER year old american religions would stand under this kind of across the globe scrutiny this book contains real in your face irrefutable evidence that like them nor not the mormons are indeed a peculiar people,1
summer of my german solider review i enjoyed this book a great deal the story was very interesting and kept the reader guessing i thought that many issues in the book were easy for students to relate to even today the author did not pull any punches in this startling work i enjoyed this book and recommend it for students in sixth grade and up,1
boring i have never read a book that was so boring the book talked about a jewish girl helping out a nazi nothing happens inthe begining and the climax is the girl housing the nati wow not weas a class read this book as a class and i asked everyone what they thought of the book they all agreed with me,0
a boring with a german soldier although at first glance the book seems to have a good plot it does not i did not like the character of patty she seemed so pathetic and she whined too much the relationship between patty and anton is very disturbing becuase patty is weird about how she reactes when she is around anton the book disturbed me,0
good this was a present for my boyfriend he seems to like it it arrived in a very reasonable time it seems to be very sturdy and easy to operate,1
little america this book was an interesting reading for me it was one of the best school readings i have been assigned it was a up front look at a man looking to uncover his fathers past his style of writing was upfront and direct we did not feel compelled to censor his minds work of placing swear words in the text where needed or being vague about intimate love sessions that had taken place i most enjoyed the idea of the go cart club the inventiveness of having this club to lure in the king is one of the most original ideas that i have read in a long while the book also has a sense of being a bit personal i do not know henry bromell only that he is good friends with ny english teacher but from reading this book i have a sense that i know a little about him that is why i believe people write books is to allow the readers to have a brief glimpse inside the authors mind and life he has in my opinion succeeded in doing so with little america,1
disappointing fine as an introduction to duncan but not for serious study at best this is a greatest hits record though that said it a bit like buying bob dylan greatest hits it good in that it touches every portion of his career but since duncan worked so fiercely in the poetics of the series and the idea of the book of poetry ultimately it leaves the reader wanting,0
bad quality zipper we outgrew our NUMBER x NUMBER tents with the kids so we bought this tent preparing for our next camp trip we test it out at our back yard right after we bought it it easy to set up and roommy however the zippers are done in very low end quality the window zippers work ok but both the door zipper did not work well the mesh zipper will open up after you zipped it the door zipper is not well stiched on one side and it hard to zip it around we are return it back to the store tomorrow,0
what i thought about this tent i bought this tent brand new and had it for one year and opened it up one time to put it up and brought on a fishing trip and the string thats in the tent poles broke in NUMBER places and the zippers are terrible always get caught its roomy but its cheap,0
amazon shipping this rice cooker works great my only complaint is with amazon this is the NUMBER nd non book item i have ordered from amazon and i do not understand why these items are only shipped in their mfg packaging with no exterior boxing thankfully this item arrived in good shape this is something to think about when ordering non book items from amazon,1

i rather stick razors into my mouth maybe it was my bad to buy a knockoff product that was so cheap compared to gum brand picks doctor brushpicks are unusable the picks have no flexibility or give maybe i could use them to clean out tiny metal machine parts,0
best band of all time this dvd is amazing braid is rock at its finest if you get a chance you must see them on their reunion tour the extras are hands down the best on any live dvd i have seen this knocked the impossibles never say goodbye dvd out of my player finally,1
well written and complete but a little dated this book was written before the pci express standard was ratified so much of the information is speculative nevertheless it is well written and complete,1
smells sweaty i used to love this perfume and used for years but the last two times i bought it from perfume world or i give someone to use i have noticed that it smells worse than sweat horrible i don t believe this is the original perfume something somewhere is not right with it but the original real paloma picasso was excellent everyone used to ask me what i was wearing and where to get it my NUMBER down the drain next time will try to buy from macys like i used to and see if i can get the original paloma,0
unsupported by the constitution yoo arguments in favor of an essentially unchecked executive fly in the face of everything that the founders intended when creating our great country he is undoubtedly intelligent given the prowess with which he manipulates the constitution and legal precepts into seemingly supporting his own theory despite the packaging however the fundamental basis for his theory is fatally flawed he is at his core merely an opportunist who advocates theories for the sole purpose of furthering his own career rather than because they actually have merit in other words he just a hack at heart this book is not worth your time or money,0
not for hydroponic growers this book contains exactly one chapter on hydroponics and it not a very good chapter as a general book on growing it not bad but anything that purports itself as being a grow bible should include extensive information on evaluating hydroponics systems and mediums and how to use and maintain them throughout a grow this book contains some information on this but not nearly enough for whatever reasons it includes far more information on genetics and breeding but most growers i know buy clones or seeds those pages would have been better devoted to all things hydroponics is there a good book focused primarily on indoor hydroponic growing not sure i need it now but it would have been great to have a few months back,0
evident growing errors some ideas in this book are as helpful as any newspapers garden section there are evident growing errors in this book if you are a beginner or intermediate grower this book may misguide your gardening efforts if you want real facts there are better sources out there,0
great find this book was a great find it has more information than pictures which is okay it is very descript in its information and easy to read i recommend this book to anyone looking to further their knowlegde in this art,1
still waiting this book never shipped ordered over NUMBER weeks ago smazon still says ships within NUMBER weeks it has been NUMBER weeks past their estimated ship date so do not bother ordering this book,0
boring pretentious crap this book is a sure snooze fest luckily for me i did not have to read the entire book for my undergrad art history photo class we read selected chapters of the book they writing was horrible many parts were unclear i had to reread what i read over and over i can not stand this style of writing barthes attempts to come off as interesting and intelligent instead he comes off as boring and pretentious skip this book try something else,0
heavy going it is my belief that people who really know what they are talking about can explain their thoughts clearly i can not be sure if the fault in this book is with the original author or the translator but it certainly does not measure up to this criterion it may be of interest to photography academics but i doubt if a photographer will get much out of it that is useful,0
dvd version please i had this vhs tape years ago but no longer own it i am looking for the dvd version of it because it is one of the most enjoyable work outs tapes i have ever done and i have done a lot of them,1
very fun video and not hard to follow this is a great intermediate video it one of my favorites it set to motown music and it very fun the moves are dancy but donna has great cueing and after a couple of times you get it down i do not like videos that are easy the first couple of times through because i get bored to fast i recommend this video to anyone who enjoys dancy aerobics it fun,1
fabulous for the first time i read a book in which i thought the artist was sitting in the room and telling me about her life the is one of the most inspiring eclectic and electrifying books i have ever read it just fabulous,1
i like elton but i admit i did not read the back of this cd carefully i happily bought it and popped it into the cd player anticipating the wonderful tunes i had heard throughout the movie but my favorites were not there the most important missing item it tough to be a god as sung by the stars of the movie elton john duet with randy newman just is not as much fun it not a bad album really i was just disappointed,0
crocodile crock the king of crocodile rock lost his teeth NUMBER years ago but here he is again plugging away in geezer fm heaven while old pharts may love the way john campy cream puff crooning fluffs up their depends kids will absolutely hate this flaccidly themed soundtrack of paint by number sugar pop fizz and bombastic lik a stik storytelling incredibly the road to el doh rado is worse than elt last tim rice collaboration aida the NUMBER multi guest stinker currently being loaded in skeet machines around the world indeed the only level this one works on is a cheap alternative for parents who want to sedate their hyperactive whippersnappers without having to shell out big bucks for a ritalin prescription give it a rest elton for gawd sake,0
not what i had hoped i was thinking that this was a cd where the music was taken from the movie not all resung by elton john the songs lost the flavor i was looking for if you are an elton john fan you probably would like it,0

very slow shipping the book i ordered was a gift i am sure they will enjoy reading it but it took a very long time to get here disappointed in that,0
a great book once i started reading this book i could not put it down it gave me even more respect for those of this generation after reading this book i had to order mr brokaw other books,1
the greatest generation excellent book with profiles of folks who survived wwii and came back to our country to make a productive life for themselves the format is very readable and the stories enjoyable despite some very serious pictures presented of the war,1
great topic poor writing style tom brokaw has chosen a fanastic topic the baby boomers parents their life times trials stamina through the depression war s and raising families i wish an author with a bit of distance and vision would have done the actual writing of this book as it is brokaw cannonizes his subjects and does a poor job telling the real story i hope this topic gets explored further by someone other than brokaw who has little talent as a writer i was very disappointed reading this book and i made the mistake of buying gift copies for my elderly war vet friend neighbors and my own father without pre reading it live and learn i guess sorry i had expectations of being thrilled with this book but was not,0
a great disapointment rather than letting his subjects tell their stories brokaw interjects his politics and philosophy i donated my copy to the city library instead read studs terkel the good war it is what brokaw could have had if he would have imitated the master oral biographer,0
mr brokaw concentrated too much on officers mr brokaw could not possibly imagine the conditions under which most young men were living when called upon to save their nation mr brokaw found mostly officers to interview most of whom went into the service as officers and later became politicians where are the uneducated poverty stricken youths who went into the armed forces fought and died for their country and those who survived returned to their former lives little better off than before being drafted the author never mentioned the fact that machinery is always in place to keep our rich youths out of the service making their service in our armed forces strictly voluntary and always as officers most repeat most of whom never heard a shot fired the exception proving the rule,0
greatest generation a very moving and informative book a friend gave me this book shortly after my father passed after reading it it made me realize what my father went through when he was in wwii this book helped me bring me closer to my father this book is full of stories of wwii vets what happened to them and how it changed there life and how they succeeded,1
inspiring i am tremendously inspired by the stories contained in this book the american spirit during wwii is unequalled especially compared to the sick societies of japan and germany whether this generation is the greatest or not there is no doubt in my mind that the cooperative effort that was required to defend freedom and defeat the fascists is without a doubt the greatest effort in history,1
a waste of time mostly pontification where the scholarship the only reason i sat through this one was that it was an audio book and i was on an eight hour drive if this is the greatest generation i am in the generation that got the bill this book glossed over most everything if anything it proved the opposite of its title,0
good idea but shallow text and a distorted picture brokaw writes not like a veteran newsman but like an awestruck hero worshipping kid that not a crime but one expects more from a man with brokaw experience and training i felt the text was very shallow especially in the final section when he interviews celebrities one does not learn a lot in this section nor does one get any meaningful insights i also felt there was a tremendous sameness about the interviews surely there were people who had bitter memories or less than passionately patriotic views brokaw could have presented a more accurate picture of the generation by including a dissenting opinion or two regrettably one has to wonder about the accuracy of his reporting on nbc news,0
a book of simple hurra patriotism i used to enjoy tom brokaw when he was nbc anchor man as a critical and competent journalist his book however is a real disappiontment for me belonging to the post war generation it reads as a very shallow hurra patriotism story without any ctitical investigation of the time priode he covers not everything this generation did was so great and i would have expected from a critical journalist like tom brokaw to take this aspect into consideration as well in this sense it is not very demanding book,0

do not waste your money i am a relative neophyte to skiing and bought this with the expectation that it might facilitate my learning in my estimation it was pretty much a waste of time and a total waste of money yes it does provide a modicum of instruction but for the most part it suppose to be developing muscle memory by having you watch techniques being repeated ad naseum did not work for me if you want some truly helpful instructional materials look at the lito tejada flores and harold harb books and tapes,0
NUMBER minutes of encouragement and fun our whole family loved this video it is not only a great introduction to skiing for new skiiers in the family both young and old alike but also gets you excited and ready to hit the slopes come winter for intermediates this is also an excellent review of the basics and some things you might have missed along the way do not miss this one,1

not much to smile about here NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER stars i enjoy a good romance film as much as the next person but this dreadful film is so forced that i could barely sit through it greg kinnear who is usually very good is flat as a pancake along with his irritating co star lauren holly there are a few scattered moments mostly from joan cusack but not not nearly enough to get this awful film off the ground i rate it NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER stars because i was somehow able to sit through this lazy comedy with no romance to be found,0
this is a horrible horrible movie i made the mistake of seeing this movie in the theater tried hard to get my money worth it was impossible the dialog was so contrived and mindless there was not a laugh to be had and the chemistry between kinnear and holly was nonexistent,0
died after NUMBER years i read those positive reviews here and bought this item NUMBER years ago it worked pretty well at the beginning starting from about a year ago it could not keep the rice moistured for long now it is no better than a NUMBER bucks rice cooker and i have to replace it,0
too slow we bought this rice cooker because everyone raved about it but no one seems to have mentioned it one huge drawback it takes forever i tried to make two cups of brown rice this evening after NUMBER minutes the water was just beginning to boil as a working mom i do not have NUMBER hours to make rice every evening yes i suppose i could get in the habit of setting up my rice in the morning and setting the timer but this requires a level of menu commitment i do not presently have or i could go back to our old one button cheapo machine that cooked white rice in NUMBER minutes brown in NUMBER my husband is asian but i am not he may like the rice better from this machine but i am cooking it and i am fed up,0
quality of cooked rice went down after about NUMBER NUMBER years for the price i expected this unit to last longer than my parents bigger and less expensive cooker can not remember the brand of their rice cooker either panasonic or national which they have used everyday for more than five years now and it still going my family did not use this zojirushi everyday but we were pretty close after about a year and a half the rice does not keep as well as it used to it dries out faster and does not cook as evenly as it did while it was under warranty i noticed most if not all the positive reviews were posted after recent purchases the handful of reviews from folks who have owned and used this item beyond warranty is not as glowing please keep that in mind if you envision using this rice cooker for years to come,0
broke in NUMBER months i was very happy with this rice cooker until the very fragile rubber grommet on the lid tore they do not sell the part beware it is great but it will not last long this feature makes it very very vulnerable i had it for NUMBER months before the fragile grommet tore now it no longer makes good rice the cost to repair it makes it useless because i would just have to repair it again in NUMBER months this is not a rice maker for anyone who cooks a lot of rice it just will not last,0
just after NUMBER NUMBER years it is toasted we bought this NUMBER NUMBER years ago it was very good at the beginning however just after NUMBER NUMBER years of light use it is now toasted the rice comes out sticky and lumpy and drys up in less than NUMBER hours we thought zojirushi stands for quality and durability we made a big mistake,0
the little appliance that will all i can say is that every working healthy and modern kitchen should have a fuzzy logic rice cooker and by buying a good one that will make porrige and has other modes you open it up to providing all kinds of wonderful and creative meals,1
we love it i purchased this rice cooker as a christmas gift for my parents i was looking for one that also cooked hot cereals or porridge i read the reviews and decided to give it a try my parents loved it my mom has alzheimer so my dad does all the cooking he has become an expert at making great yummy hot cereals once my husband tasted the hot cereals he ordered a cooker for us as well the cooker is very easy to clean we are very happy with it ours is made in japan,1
best white fluffy rice i have ever had the rice turned out perfect very different from other rice cookers i have tried i am worried about what the other reviewers mentioned that the battery could out for the lcd display though since i do not intend to plug the machine in all time,1
great item i was a little confused by reading reviews but i decided on the gofit ball at NUMBER cm and it worked out just right for my NUMBER NUMBER frame there was no odor from the ball and was not difficult to blow up the ball with the pump provided did my abdomial exersizes with no proplem with my NUMBER lbs of body weight i would recommend this item,1
like it as other reviews band around ball showing the exercises is unnecessary and not nice looking functions well no problem with the pump use it as an alternative desk chair,1
way too soft it is possible i got a defective ball but i bought this with the intention of using it for p NUMBER x NUMBER i inflated it following the directions precisely but i found it nearly impossible to perform most of the exercises because the ball compressed so much it is very high quality and was nearly odorless but i highly suggest going for a cheaper ball i am now using a tko ball that is more firm,0
change the picture please i read the reviews prior to ordering the color indicated in the photo was purple which i really wanted but i took note that several folks received red i ordered anyway and of course received a red one in spite of not getting a purple ball i still think it a good product heavy duty which was important to me since i need to trust my ball as i too am heavy duty it holds it shape and it volume of air and i feel very comfortable on it i am in a stability ball class and have tried the other balls there and like the weight and feel of my red ball i will probably order another smaller one a NUMBER cm the NUMBER cm is great for sitting but a little to large for some of the other activities so i think having a pair of different sizes is the way to go,1
not been able to inflate it fully yet we have not figured out gow to inflate it fully yet the go fit customer service is open only monday friday NUMBER NUMBER so we have not used it yet i think i should have just bought it from a local store the instructions are quite poor,0
great purchase a coworker of mine had ordered this exact ball and i liked it so much i ordered one for myself great value arrived promptly this one is fairly large but i am NUMBER so it works great for me shorter folks might want to try one of the smaller ones,1
big tough and relatively easy to inflate this ball is extremely durable a great size and was easy to inflate for tall people it is excellent the skin is thick and we have had no issues with it and do not feel any danger of it popping,1
having fun with the ball my husband got this ball as an accessory to a workout program he is using it has served that purpose very well and also our kids love it it pretty big so to them it the ultimate toy i am happy its anti burst and i can see us using it for many years it is very quality,1
comprehensive book this book contains a myriad of case studies concerning a wide variety of acoustical problems very rich in detail i found it helpful when trying to tackle challenging acoustical problems,1
huh this is very odd in NUMBER garth brooks had success when he put out a box set with a similiar theme however for some artists that kind of treatment does not work and it falls flat i like toby keith but this box set is just a way for a record company to make money buy repackaging three cd none of which are any good or have any worth and make an extra buck it just sad,0
effortless and misleading when i bought this box set i expected to recieve compact discs that were fully remastered with NUMBER bit technology instead they sound exactly like the original discs i already have while you may find several top quality country hits in this set the sound quality is not up to snuff for today standards so now i am stuck with doubles of everything and out thrity bucks,0
what is this gorgeous chaos just buy this album the rain is the best song ever got a bone is close to being the best ballad ever each song is as original and unexpected as an earthquake push it out feel the beta vibe,1
thoroughly enjoyable respecatble thank goodness for the beta band i must say this album is a real treat for the ears sonically broad lyrically uplifting and overall a good time for all kinda like if graham parsons spliced his genes with beck hanson had a daughter who then married david byrne and had a mess of kids thereby amounting to the beta band musically it that hard to pin them down and that a good thing definitely an album that can be enjoyed for ages on end the only drawback i felt was the appropriately titled but hey everyone is entitled to their madness,1
a great guide in simple terms a great comprehensive guide that helped me to understand why this happened in a historical context also helped me to get a better grasp of what to expect with the war against afghanistan and al qaeda now i know why this happened and what to expect the news media seems to breeze over historical elements in favor of status quo anthrax and millitary events but this book really helped me to get caught up on my facts highly recommended,1
more than disco in the begining thier was house and before that thier was salsoul the root of house music started with salsoul this cd captures some of the best songs that they produced to say that this is just another disco cd would be doing it a grave disjustice it would be like calling the mona lisa just a painting or the statue of dave just a rock this is a compilation of the best dance music ever recorded the blend of rebel rosing vocals and smooth lyrical contents with the monstrative rythems are timeless classics my only regret is they did not release all of thier gems out on one compliation this is a must have for any disco house dance or r b collection,1
childhood favorite this was an important book to me when i was a little girl growing up in colorado i could not tell you how many times i checked it out of the library to read and reread again i even remember where it was second shelf from the end three row up reddish hardback cover over the years i forgotten the title i just remembered that it was about a little native american girl who climbed a tree and found another world in the sky after a tedious search of my old towns online library yay for modern internet searches i found a title that rung a bell and won a copy on ebay i am so happy to have this book on my shelf now wonderful wonderful story,1

serious flaw with this bike rack screws made of plastic at first glance this rack seems well designed in fact when i first put it on my car it felt very secure however after NUMBER days i noticed that one of the inner arms was loose on closer inspection i realized that the screw that tightens the arm was defective and would not tighten after pulling it out i was not surprised because the screw is made of plastic i could not believe it the entire rack was total garbage because of one plastic screw the screw is not replaceable with something from your local hardware store either it is a specialty screw with a large cap on it that lets you hand tighten it i can not believe that saris would do this just to save a few bucks this rack went back to amazon and good riddance,0
menotti amahl and the night visitors the quality is tenth rate this dvd is almost unwatchable and the audio sucks,0
good show bad release air is a pretty decent show though not quite as good as kanon and clannad that came afterwards adv also gave it a great dub but it not worth buying this set not only does it cram all the episodes onto two discs with funi usually bad av quality as a result but it also strips one of the episodes from the series it may only be a recap episode but it still part of the show this is not a complete collection and not worth buying,0
heller with a gun this novel takes you from a warm fire to the icy wastes and carries you on a wild flight to survive the elements and overcome the threat to innocent travellers a excellent adventure with a unexpected ending,1
best keep as a secret this is a story with a modicum of drama except for a small dog surprising given the starry nature of the human cast close to nonexistence suspense and muddy sound recording compounded with hard to understand dialog english accents and all that gielgud performance as the hero is mostly one dimensional when you can understand his delivery as the heroine carroll acting ranges from chatty to zombie and lorrie delivery is over the top ham and quite frankly an embarrassment as he portrays the good guy killer all this is in marked contrast to the achievements of the fourth principal performer robert young young provides an acting tour de force as the subject matter of the film he makes the film his own there are some gee wiz for the time NUMBER special in camera editing effects which were then fast becoming and would continue to be a hitchcock trademark not one of hitchcock masterpieces but not one of his disasters either william flanigan ph d,0

another great feinstein golf book feinstein takes a different tack in the open versus his previous golf books a good walk spoiled and the majors instead of stories about the players on the tour this story focuses on the people behind the transformation of the worn out municipal golf course bethpage black into the great course that hosted the NUMBER u s open championship i found i could not stop reading as feinstein prose is once again funny heartwarming and flowing my only critique is that i wished for more detail on rees jones changes to a g tillinghast design with illustrations for a book about the transformation of the golf course there is not enough about the physical changes that were done the book does a great job portraying the enormity of the project that was undertaken so the satisfaction that is felt with the success of the championship seems to be well deserved,1
a good open spoiled the subtitle should be inside the port o johns at bethpage black because feinstein devotes many pages to the man who set up all those portable toilets that lined the golf course every last one even one that tiger briefly did some business in the guy who unloaded the port o johns off the truck is interesting for about a clause but we get page after page of this guy you think he was the pope of bethpage black if you want to know fascinating stuff like the precise NUMBER of port o johns that actually lined the golf course then attempt to burrow your way through open the playing of golf i am talking about the first actual golf shot of the tournament does not make its first appearance until page NUMBER at that point the book is more than two thirds over feinstein phoned this one in did someone edit this he should have called it a good open spoiled do not waste your money,0

one of the best texts in calculus reform if you read it through and through you will find how wonderful it is to approach calculus in a graphical numerical and symbolic way if you want to challenge your mind in this way this book is probably the most suitable for you i am using it in my calculus calss and i found the concepts are very clearly explained the thing that i love most of this book is that it helps students develop a good understanding of calculus through observing and studying the graphs of the functions this only imperfection of the book if any is that there lack of some theoretical exercises but any book can not be perfect the most important thing is how you enjoy it for me it is a new and fresh guide of the study of calculus,1
nearly useless as a calculus textbook i am a fan of traditional theorem proof exposition and this ostebee zorn text demonstrates why this book attempts to make calculus easy to understand but the only result is that it is impossible to follow essential concepts are buried deep within piles of verbiage and the examples skip important steps making them hard to follow add to that the large number of typos and errors in the solutions manual as a teaching assistant i have had strong mathematics students who could not understand this book and whose knowledge of calculus suffered as a result with so many quality calculus textbooks on the market it is hard to understand why a school would choose to use this unsuccessful experiment,0
i would not recommend this book too much dam sex i would not recommend this book i believe that roth is too involved in the characters having sex than trying to get some sort of plot going i did not enjoy reading goodbye columbus but i did enjoy reading the short stories where it is not about sex but rather about religion thank you for the short stories,0

not for dog lovers only james herriot dog stories is written by a man who loves both people and animals the descriptions of people dogs and his humble view of himself are an irresistable combination the accuracy and wit with which he presents people relationships with their dogs is priceless when i read this book i laugh at the eternal goofiness of dogs and also dog people the sadder stories are written with a balanced view this book is an amazing collection of short stories highly recommended,1

only one part was good in this whole book this book is about some girl from barbados named kit tyler who has to move to wethersfield connecticut first of all the characters are the most boring people in the world the plot stinks there barely is a plot i like books where there is a lot of action and the story mountain has bumps along the way this book there is no mountain and they just go on flat ground just to let you know i am being metaphoric here and then go up a little hill the only reason i actually gave this book a star is because the witch trials and where kit is running away is kind of suspenseful just do not read this book it is not good,0
ok this book was ok to me it dragged on quite a bit but i really liked the ending i did not like how it would talk about the same thing for over NUMBER chapters it just felt like it was not my kind of book however i liked the last part the last NUMBER chapters were probably that only part i liked,0
boring after purchasing this for our home library i could not wait to read it before my children did i was bored and unenthused throughout the reading the author made great attempts at historical accuracy just not enough with character or plot development the story must have been born of facts first as the characters just seemed thrown about and inconsistent along with the lack of plot those inconsistencies are what make this a brutal read i can not imagine either of my young avid readers enjoying this book and all its predictabilities,0
very bad work by elizabeth speare review for mr jones i think this book was boring the only exciting part is the witch hunt most of the time they talked about polatics if they wer not the were cring over petty grevences such as love this is why this story was boring the characters were annoying and obtuse it was hard reading such a disgusting piece of lititure kit was such an unintelligent and snooty creature it was infurating to read about the women were either self centered or meek the thought about love all the time the men disscussed politics like a change would end the world and the men thought women were dirt nat and the cat were the only intellegent creatures the characthers are just lacking perwsonality and intellegence,0
love this book i have read this book several times since i was a pre teen it like visiting an old friend each time i love it one of my all time favorites,1

an interesting but predictible book this book was semi interesting i liked certain parts but compared to other books this one was too predictible i prefered the book beyond the burning time not only was it better it was less predictable and more interesting but read the two books for yourself and you can decide,0
a girl who lost everything takes her chances in wethersfield this book was an overall NUMBER star book the quality of the dialogue was horrible because it was very unrealistic this book was also very boring and drawn out because it did not have a lot of action the characters however were very interesting and original the events were very boring and predictable,0
a joy to read this book was a wonderfully light and entertaining read kit is a young girl who is forced to leave her island home of barbados in the late NUMBER and live with a strict puritan community in connecticut she has many new relationships some good and some bad in this land where life seems so harsh one of her special relationships is with an elderly quaker woman the witch of blackbird pond the author is detailed in showing early new england life the characters are a charming and i will always remember hannah tupper a fabulous book for adults young and old,1

true sons of merengue they have that unmistakable beet like their fathers which is always good to hear but they have managed to do create a new style whch is what makes this one mortal as soon as i saw them do one of their songs on tv i went out to buy it i was not disappointed it is extremely danceable i also love the name and what it means,1
this music will take your words from you one of the best albums ever any genre any era my god what a knock out this is the latest musical persona of will oldham whose illustrious career began as palace palace music palace brothers and many say it his greatest achievement yet i knew within ten seconds of first hearing this record that it had to be true every song reaches in and squeezes the heart gets all tangled up in your insides you know what great about this record every single haunting track is memorable and affecting every one there is not a single track that fades into the background and that is a rare treat these days and the fact that a tune as staggeringly vibrant as a minor place can co exist so easily with smothering odes like i see a darkness is just amazing it is in many ways like life,1
perversely uplifting i am trying to be frugal with my five star reviews but this album deserves full marks without question judging by my screen name one can safely assume that i am a will oldham fan i myself not being much of a writer will avoid trying to pin this album down with my words but direct those interested to reviews at both pitchforkmedia com and nme com,1

this album suxxxx i could hardly stand to listen to this cd for more than five minutes it was so depressing and all the songs practically sounded the same get what the story morning glory it rocks,0
not all that i am a oasis fan and to be honest be here now is not very good the only good songs are know what i mean magic pie stand by me and all around the world which is too long its no where near as good as the others and is not worth the money,0
not terrible but really not good enough this is a poor attempt at a follow up to morning glory i would not say its terrible but i would not buy it again if given the choice which is a shame really because their first two were quite good,0
worn out washed up has beens i do not have to hear only new music all the time but i must say that oasis be here now is one album i just as soon forget forever if what the story morning glory defined and popularized brit pop be here now sounded its death knell i will admit that the sound is much like older oasis recordings but that just the problem it too much like the older stuff and sounds suspiciously like the gallaghers were in a hurry to turn out something anything a s a p what makes this album so bad is that it was hyped so much which left this oasis fan with a sharp sense of being taken for a ride oasis may be the most popular british band but they are not the best much british talent goes unnoticed overseas i e silver sun the dandys shed seven catatonia northern uproar and that a shame save your money for something more original than be here now,0
a terrific follow up to their last album i loved oasis first us album what the story morning glory and this was a wonderful follow up the music is crisp fresh and has catchy melodies that keep you listening i love oasis and i love this cd,1
another example of cocaine fuelled excess be here now does have its moments know what i mean my big mouth stand by me and do not go away along with a few lesser tracks all around the world and it getting better man and a true dog magic pie but it just another example of what happens when you are worth NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER the cocaine supply is never ending noel gallagher has admitted this and stopped using and you ask how long a cd is NUMBER minutes and you say well let us fill the expletive up the production is awful knobs up full stop layers and layers of squalling guitars all hints of subtleness are gone except for the end part of do not go away the band still rocks out but the sound is harsh i almost gave it three stars because of the decent songs on here but i have got to deduct one star for the phil spector with hearing damage style of production sorry guys find a better producer next time out,0
boring the songs in this album are quite boring only a few good ones i would not recommend it get their previous albums instead,0
this one amazing album i like oasis because their songs are rhythmic and i like the lead singer voice all of their songs have a different rhythmic and all songs are really good there are NUMBER songs on this album i like the NUMBER th song stand by me because it really nice when they say stand by me nobody knows the way it going to be i like these parts and the NUMBER th song do not go away is good too i found this song is for when something sad has happened to you it one of the best song in this album so i think this album is fantastic i want oasis to sing many songs,1
thank god we have oasis these album is their best work yet the songs are an interesting conbination of the songs from the albums they did before the songs has the basic things from the first record and the elegancy and sofistication of what the story morning glory as well you will hear more details in these one these is the band of the NUMBER and they will be the band of the NUMBER of course so buy it now noel is a tired and true music god,1
top one mad for it why do yankees always put oasis down eh they are the greatest band ever i live in the same city as they did and i am listening to their music NUMBER NUMBER people just get jealous of their success if anyone agrees or disagrees e mail me instantly,1

billy joel my life single when i purchased this cd i did not know what to expect i have been a billy joel fan for my whole life i was very surprised during the first listen even though it sounded something like frank sinatra would write it still has the billy joel feel both with the music and timing as this fan grows older this is a welcome sound i hope there is more to come joseph leonardi,1
great book like eragon i first watched the movie and really enjoyed it afterwards i read the book and realized that the movie was horribly done when compared to the book i liked all of the character building in the book and thought it had plenty of humor and action there was no sex and cussing that i remember in the book for those that do not like to read that sort of stuff on a side note my inner immaturity laughed when the words and were used to describe feelings and expressions five stars,1
fun read this book was really fun it was action packed the beginning was a little odd at least to me but the rest of the story kept me interested since it an older story it really great for adults like me who love old school sci fi my son was not grabbed by it by the way so not sure if it great for kids,1
the gadget is it too good the gadget by paul zindel is about a thirteen year old stephen orr his father is a scientist that works for the goverment in the time period of the NUMBER if you are person who likes history and science this book is perfect stephen is a person who i can relate to becasue i know a person just like him matt hadsell they both like to explore the unknow and discover the undiceded as my title says too good thats exactly what this book is so if you like reading or just want an intersting read the gadget is right for you,1

nice pitcher received the item and it is just like advertised purchased it to replace a small frothing pitcher so i can foam milk for more than one cup of coffee nice quality pitcher,1
excellent perfect for frothing well built product would buyanother in a heartbeat no more dribbles from a roundedged vessel i was using previously,1
works well is a bit hard to clean i have been using the carafe for NUMBER months and generally speaking a pleasure to use it decently constructed though by no means heavy duty and it lasted so far even though i am not gentle on things my only real complain is that because the carafe narrows at the top and it rather tall it hard to clean the bottom without a brush,1
frothing pitcher given as a gift today to go with recipients coffee maker they used it for their guests same day and really likedappreciated the size and quality of the pitcher it a perfectsize to give you the option of quantity to make,1
the fall of reach this book is very good the story line is fantastic and i can not put it down there is one problem however this book was very poorly proofread if proofread at all there are many grammatical mistakes and other errors that middle school students could eliminate if they had read their work nonetheless i highly recommend the fall of reach and the rest of the series as long as you are able to overlook certain imperfections,1
these books rock growing up in a military family makes me like the style of these books all the more they pull you into the halo universe and you immediately become attached to the characters great stories and insight into the award winning game halo after reading it i wanted to play some halo and kick some covenant rear,1
typos galore i am almost finished with the fall of reach and while i love the story the editors need to be shot wherever there is a word that has the letters f and i together they are missing ie file is le and officer is of cer i think there a date typo too where it supposed to be the day after and they did not change it it a little confusing and takes from the read when you have to pause and figure out what being said i will update or comment when i finish the other NUMBER books hopefully they are not as bad,1
stop screaming now i am a huge fan of jack off jill my ruin otep ect and those chicks can scream however the vocalist of sugarcoma fails to make the music enjoyable with her weak screaming the singers oj joj mr otep ect put power behing their music and make it enjoyable sugarcoma just makes it annoying she does have a nice singing voice and the band is very talented i think sugarcoma would be better off if she did not scream,0
a valuable gift when you are at a loss to communicate much less comfort a friend who has experienced a death this book can speak for you consider giving it as a gift more personal and more everlasting than flowers if you have lost a loved one take this book as your own companion to help you move through your grief someone who understands is waiting in this book to support your journey it will help,1
pass on this one this book was not what i expected the author spends much valuable time describing his personal trials and tribulations with the russian system rather than explaining the what how where and gory details of biological warfare if you are looking for an exciting read pass on this one i did read the whole thing and i can guarantee it will put you to sleep every time you pick it up,0
the humper still defines and redefines love if you can get past the cover and inside photos a humper who looks suspiciously surgically streamlined you will be for a warm fuzzy surprise the humper still has it smooth vocals with a blend of country and pop and the softest of rock possible all showcased with his three and a half octave range there are covers volare penny lane perhaps an homage to the beatles the group whom he knocked off the charts with his no NUMBER hit release me if tomorrow never comes this guy in love with you and the underrated aznavour anthem she there an infectious taste of calypso with brazil and a truly likable country flavored how slow we go co written by the humper daughter louise the best track is the title track definition of love proof indeed that the man still defines love now a bad way to celebrate NUMBER years in the business of making love on the record,1
it was pretty good i enjoyed the book for the most part and learned some things however he seemed to repeat the information a lot guess repetition is the key to memory it was to a point that annoyed me though then again repetition annoys me period lol also somethings kinda contradicted themselves but for the most part it was a pretty decent book and i did learn some things and def recommend this vs regular running relying on super thick soles praying the shoe will protect you which will give you more injuries later down the road,1
if you run you have to give it a try i read chirunning in sep NUMBER it took me NUMBER wks to get the form right while running i have been chirunning since it not effortless my heart rate meter tells me so though it does feel effortless for a whole minute or two doing medium sprints i now run NUMBER x a week an hour or two each time this is something i never been able to do in the past because my knees always started giving problems and i have to train on an elliptical afterwards the knees are fine now i am sure danny would not recommend it but you can even run on a bad knee with this technique i ran NUMBER k on a poor knee without much loss of speed my timing has also improved though not as much as i hoped or expected hence NUMBER stars enjoy running you should give it a go,1
not worth the time i checked this book out from my local la leche league i am surprised they still have this book available being nearly twenty years old maybe some of my problems are with it being outdated however my main gripe is that it is very condescending and judgmental instead of just informing you on different options none of which would work for me and only one or so that would apply well to a full time job this book presents a certain ideal and if the job arrangements do not fit that ideal they are not good arrangements and you are not a good mother if you want helpful non opinionated advice this is not the book for you currently i am reading the working mother guide to life which seems much more friendly and helpful,0
wha i do not get this cd i listened to it listened to it again chased my cat cheeseyfranks with a salisbury steak tv dinner listened to it again and nope nothing it more average rock by bands that mark knopfler should put over his knee and whoop with a copy of procol harum las vegas comeback effort it junk kroll was all about sparta about NUMBER months ago before a telemarketer talked him into some psychic network he now tells me that my oatmeal may jump up and start singing showtunes if my aura is not in line anyway sparta is a waste of time only saved by the bell the pre school years can compete with,0
take a peak first a fast read has some helpful teaching points and very general commentary on japanese society seems a bit outdated too at least my NUMBER edition does a lot of time spent covering things you could easily look up on the web if you are going to japan through jet you will have heard a lot of this stuff by the time you get to japan definitely check this out in a bookstore before buying probably give it a pass,0
amazing song great performance wonderful voices mariah and whitney are together with celine dion and aretha franklin the greatest singers alive they really show their voices power in this song and they made a wonderful job together well done girls well done,1
generally good viewing angle annoying i agree with most of what the previous reviewer said what i dislike most is the are extremely narrow viewing angle and the lack of antireflective coating otherwise it is a generally good device my wish list for the next version includes built in wi fi and the ability to browse the network neighborhood and pull media files from any machine on the local wireless network and an internet browser,1
does not work for all the famous names in this movie soomething better should have come out of it it was predictable from the first and the twists and turns were just silly they could not leave the estate although one of them managed to arrive from the outside just about every one was involved in something illicit or at least in something strange lovers were talked about but not really discussed the biggest bombshell involving supposed incest was discussed by just two of the eight and nothing was made of it this movie was just an unrelated bunch of snippets that just does not work,0
NUMBER beautiful women during a snowstorm eight women are stranded in a french country home with the corpse of the murdered family patriarch slightly bizarre low key french film pokes fun at the comedy murder mystery genre while heralding the feminine mystique of domesticity and dominance it has the added distinction of breaking into song from each of the eight principal players a strangely satisfying technique that often delivers touching portraits of womankind this is as intoxicating as a glass of fine french wine,1
the passion for life is ageless zorba the greek is a novel that has inspired me since i was a child alexis is a man that has this atomic reactor in his body that he can not control the coal mine owner his boss starts to realize little by little what zorba is all about despite that his worker is not educated he learns a lot about life from him this kind of novel is the one you do not forget and in my case is present for many situations zorba is never let down by failure or tragedy take your shoes off and dance to the rhytm of life,1
pretty good i would not go so far as to call it brilliant zorba is a refreshing and likeable character but at times i felt that he was a bit too preachy his dialogue a bit overly pedantic the story to me felt a bit too long and choppy with not much of a plot but there are a few interesting and beautiful moments that reminds us to enjoy life to the fullest like i said not a brilliant book but pretty good nonetheless,0
buyer beware this was the worst pair of headphones i have ever bought and it was not easy to get the local bose store to give me a full refund on them despite their advertised no hassle refund policy terrible sound poor ergonomics medicore noise cancellation never again will i buy another bose product i should have known better my husband has a ridiculous bose wave radio which he now tells everyone that he won at a christmas raffle at the office because he too embarassed to confess that he paid half a grand for the thing my son pointed me towards a pair of sennheisers which were better in every respect and at one third of the price,0
great headphones i use these for blocking out noise at the office and then take them home for gaming they are very versatile and the sound quality is very good they do a great job of blocking out external noise that dog barking that guy in the next cubical that has to yell into his phone or that guy that has to smack his lips when he chewing gum sometimes its just enough to put them on flip the power switch and relax without actually hooking them up to listen to something i am very comfortable wearing them from NUMBER am to NUMBER pm while it would be nice if my ears had a little more ventilation but that would defeat the purpose of the noise canceling,1
worst investment paid NUMBER NUMBER for these about NUMBER years ago after about NUMBER years of light use the ear pad vinyl fell apart and the head bar rubber padding became very sticky comes off on your fingers and gets on everything the replacement ear pads do not fit into the frame well and come out easily the overall quality of sound and durability was very disappointing i found several over the ear clip ear phones for under NUMBER NUMBER to be superior in every way including comfort quality stereo and i can use these cheaper ear phones when i am sweating exercising do not try that with the bose headphones the bose headphones did not really cancel ambient noise i do not use them anymore,0
excellent audio poor physical construction i have owned my pair for close to four years now and they are starting to physically deteriorate the sound quality is excellent as is the noise canceling i used these in an office cubicle environment and later in a computer room and the performance on my ipod is outstanding but at this point the plastic upright on each earphone has broken and needs to be held together with wire ties and the rubber cover on one of the ear pieces has worn through granted i use them almost every day but they do not see rough use and this is not the type of endurance i expect from a NUMBER product the two year warranty is not long enough to address these issues updated january NUMBER one of the ear pieces finally cracked at the pivot point and simply fell off when i contacted boise they did offer to replace them with a new set for NUMBER,0
only one problem with the backgammon set i purchased a new backgammon set and it arrived in perfect condition the only problem i had was the black pieces they were somehow discolored on every one this problem was not present on the white everytime i play it the black pieces bother me i would like instructions on getting another set of black pieces i feel that i should not have to pay since this set was not cheap please advise thanks gary h,1
hmmm would i recommend it yes but try to get it used also i would definitely buy their next in hopes that they may find themselves with a more well defined sound you catch a bit of a sense that they are trying to be the beastie boys on another level they need to just try to be quarashi but they clearly are not entirely sure who that is the first track is by far the best on the album in my opinion it absolutely rocks but the rest of it does not have the teeth that track does if you like this first track do not buy the whole album for it the entire album is only NUMBER minutes,0
i think you should read this i think it was a very good book especially if you are interested in indian crafts or building a bow and arrow,1
i own this so should you i am a professional chef and a big fan of german knives i like a heavier knife in my hand that i know will do the job all day long that i want it to this set is amazing and i use it every day granted i have swapped out a few of the garnish instruments for what i prefer to use hate the zester and the peeler turned heads when i first brought it out at work but everyone wants to borrow my knives now due to their superior quality and sharpness i wanted something other than a tired out knife roll that everyone has and have not regretted a single second of owning this item,1
elli coming of age in the holocaust if you are ready for a stark unrelenting description of life in the ghetto auschwitz and dachau this book does not let up for one sentence amazing story and written in a way that is poetic but easy to read the book is classified as fiction but it is really a memoir with names changed there is no way anyone could make this up,1
typos typos typos i am ok with paying for ebooks i bought this one but was so distracted by multiple scan induced typographical artifacts that i requested and received a refund about two thirds of the way through the book free ebooks force me to tolerate some typos as those books are done by volunteers and not for profit but an NUMBER kindle book sold by amazon should be free of such nuisances this one was not and i am basing this review solely on the poor quality of the ebook itself not the content or theme of this book it a shame to hype the kindle format while simultaneously selling a sub standard version of that very format,0
i did not think it was that great maybe it was because i did not know the story of cupid and psyche before i read the book but i was not overly moved by this book i especially did not enjoy part ii when i just kept wondering what the heck is going on thank goodness that lewis included the summary of the traditional myth at the end it might be helpful to read this part first,0
do not bother i love this group early feel good canadian rock n roll but i stumbled onto this album in a music store in the mall with excitement i sampled all the songs and to my disappointment i still can not figure out what the hit was suppose to be it really terrible so do not bother just stick to their old stuff their NUMBER stuff rocks,0
great for a laugh if you appreciate the finer aspects of life in rural southern states you need to buy this dvd for a good laugh,1
did we see the same movie i could not wait to see this movie because of so many good reviews but without having read the reviews or other synopsis i would not have had a clue what was happening in the movie there were so many flashbacks in the middle of scenes you never knew where you were i like christian bale but his fine acting was lost in the fancy editing and as for katie holmes her acting was like a piece of cardboard thank goodness someone loaned me the movie and i did not have to pay for it what a disappointment sorry because i know the other reviews are great but you must have been watching another movie,0
batman scores a win christian bale is great as bruce wayne and the rest of the crew liam neeson michael caine gary oldman morgan freeman make this film the best batman movie yet the director takes a different course than previous films batman begins is dark and sinister we see why bruce wayne turned to crime fighting the film is chock full of suspense action and high tech gadgets the hd dvd version is a flawless transfer and a worthy addition to your collection,1
best batman series great beginning best batman series this is a great start to a fantastic story line this gives great detail to the development of the character who becomes the dark knight a must see film and must see series,1
review style comment if you are a batman fan this is the movie to see we start at bruce wayne beginnings and travel with him as he trains to become the dark knight the script was approved by dc comics and therefore holds more truth to the original story than the batman movies before it christian bale was a really great casting choice as he has the duality to play both the suave bruce wayne and the haunted batman micheal caine liam neeson and morgan freeman played their characters with the great skill that we have come to expect from these legendary actors cillian murphy portrayal of dr jonathan crane was amazing and complex i look forward to the next movie in this remarkable new series,0
batman begins blu ray muy buena adquisici n el producto lleg a mi oficina NUMBER d as antes de lo estimado en excelente estado sin duda comprar a de nuevo,1
a new batman i have all the batman series of movies and am a comic book fan from way back i wanted the new take on the character the movie does not disappoint it goes back and gives a new look at the beginning of the man becoming the character the cast is well developed as the story progresses and it is a joy to watch the film this is a more serious batman than some of the other incarntions the action is fast and cast is great i will enjoy this movie over and over,1
no batmobile NUMBER it took for ever to get started the whole bring the same fear to your enemies was annoying NUMBER there was a classic batman bad guy NUMBER no batmobile the plot was good except the NUMBER st half and the special were good could have been a lot better,0
the best batman as a long time batman fan i do use a batman comforter i think that this batman movie is the best of the lot while all are fun this one seemed to capture the dark charm of batman so much better then the others you get to see bruce wayne before batman and really see that batman over any other superhero is really just a man trying to make the world a safer place now that i have got that out of my system let me just say that christian bale was great the whole movie had fantastic casting katie holmes was not very believable as a strong district atorney and really did not hold up that well against bale on the screen i believe that the moive is interesting enough that even people who are watching the movie simply because it is batman will love it too,1
title for my review i rented this movie because i was catching up on the trilogy preparing for dark knight rises this movie was awesome was really sets up for the next movies along with the other two this movie is a must plus because i did not own the dvd amazon was a fantastic alterative with superb streaming quality,1
may be a bit overrated i actually enjoyed this movie quite a bit but it may be a touch overrated adequate if not good performances by all members of the cast especially christian bale who comes across as interesting charismatic and likeable the imagery may have been a bit run of the mill compared to a tim burton rendering nonetheless the batman franchise seems to still be alive and well with this latest edition author ofadjust your brain a practical theory for maximizing mental health,1
cool movie but not the best ever i know you recent movie goers have just come out of the theatre recently i did too we are charged up but do not get out of control get a bat grip on yourself the best batman movie was the NUMBER tim burton original batman returns comes next and batman begins is somewhere around there the schumacher ones while not being superb still have their moments the batsuit did make bale look sometimes like fatman the batarangs were rusty looking and not cool enough i like the action sequences and how the story circled on fear the early training stuff seemed to go a little too fast all in all batman begins is a good movie i just think people need to think twice before they label bale better than keaton heeeelll noo o,1
batman begins batman begins is the best movie of NUMBER christine bale stares in this movie and hedid a wonderful job doing it this movie is about how bruce wayne turns to batman he trains to be a ninja in asia and then founds that gotham city is flooded over with crimanels so bruce wayne has to turn into batman to kill his very first villan the scarcrow who could destroy poeples minds into panik this movie is awsome,1
very good very entertaining good quality blu ray for the theatrical version have not yet explored the special features,1
i am not sure why this movie got good reviews i am not sure why this movie has gotten good reviews it was not good the dialog was awful the plot ridiculous we have to destroy it in order to save it i wish liam would stop taking on mentor roles the final scene was physically impossible swinging under the train as it was moving just ask yourself how he swung past the pylons that held the rail up,0
best batman movie until dark knight came out batman begins was such a relief for batman fans finally we have a movie that is worth braggin about and has taken the franchise in a great new direction this one is definitely the NUMBER nd best batman movie to date and i say that because the dark knight was just so damn good even if you are not a superhero movie fan you will like this one this takes away the supernatural superhero aspects of other comic movies and turns it more realistic highly recommend,1
it below average it contains a lot of action however it does not appeal to me the acting is not engaging i do not feel related to the plot i prefer spiderman NUMBER,0
a good batman in long time i saw this movie this past summer it s a good movie it s better than other two batman movies batman forever and batman and robin this movie got something right as far the comic goes thejoker did n t kill bruce pranets keaton did a better job as batman mr bale played a good batman this movie has minor actor in it a good saga review NUMBER NUMBER,1
this movie was never that good i also do not know why they bothered with this limited edition gift set the extra disk does nothing except waste your time,0
batman begins it was a gift for my nephew for christmas it came in great shape and even included a comic book,1
it has been said before but bears repeating best batman yet christan bale as a young bruce wayne batman is a much needed reinvention of the batman movie franchise he has amazing screen presence and makes you believe that he is the dark knight i was impressed how naturally he jumped into the role and made it his own the story is tight and easy to follow the cinematography is beautiful especially the parts filmed in iceland big sweeping shots of snow covered mountains and raggedy buildings lining the slopes just fabulous the NUMBER disc dvd set is spectacular the video transfer is almost perfect and there are plenty of extras for the rabid batman fan the compilation comic book is a very nice addition i would recommend this set to anybody,1
would not recommend this toy my NUMBER year old son received this toy as a gift although he somewhat enjoys playing with it i was seriously disappointed with the functionality of the click bricks first the click bricks do not together well if you pick up two joined sections or try to reposition them they fall apart very frustrating for a NUMBER year old i think the magnets are way too weak some of the magnets do not work at all second you can not really build much of anything with the pieces in this set they have some neat pictures of built projects on the box but good luck recreating them i would absolutely not recommend this toy my son has much more fun playing with his mega blocks and with his basic wooden alphabet blocks hope this review is helpful to you,0
sounds like a good idea but i bought this toy for my son for christmas i had bought some of the trucks and wanted him to have bob and wendy too i found this set and thought it would be great they only good thing about this set is that he has bob and wendy the clicking blocks sound like a great concept but they do not work if you can get them to click you are lucky you can not build anything with this set the box shows a house buildings etc but you can not build these thing because the magnets are in the wrong places and the roofs make the whole thing top heavy i would avoid this set unless you just really need bob and wendy like us,0
could be better i have had this windshield mount for a few months now and while it works i can not really say that i would recommend it to anyone else as the other review said it shakes quite a bit while driving however that is bearable compared to the real problem the pivot head is just not very sturdy hitting the smallest bumps on the road or even just turning could cause the pivot head to swivel leaving your psp in a slanted position the pivot head swivels while driving whether or not i have the psp docked in the windshield mount so it not an issue of weight i end up having to adjust its position every few minutes which is not exactly the safest thing to have to do while driving,0
disappointing firstly i found this cream to have an odd smell to it secondly it moisturizes well but not as well as i had anticipated and hoped this product was disappointing and i do not plan on repurchasing there are other products from neostrata that i love but this definitely is not one of them,0
crystal clear production and interesting arrangements i really like this album and i think the intent of the musician is somewhat more involved than the lyrics would have you believe i think he is railing against the church and how it has distorted and destroyed whatever purity there was about the early christian movement musically the horror film samples work well next to the distorted vocals the synths sound fantastic and the percussion has a nice amount of grainy distortion added so that the tracks are rarely boring if at all they pound scream and soar through the average sonic boundary i agree with virus mag review in that this album is not the most original thing out there but the concept of the album is interesting and keeps it all pieced together there nothing bad about this album per se but nothing really grabs my attention as being too exciting in terms of originality nevertheless a good album for fans of dark electro industrial terror ebm,1
athletic director gofit vest great to work with regarding ease of putting it on and especially the velco straps to hold it together we use it in spiking and agility drills for volleyball it still allows the arm and shoulder to be used effectively and we really like the weight distributed in the front rather than on the shoulders or back highly recommend,1
weighted walking vest i really like this product i have been using it for walking the bridges and the parks and have just started using it for jogging and i have seen results already it funny too when you take it off it feels like you instantly lost NUMBER lbs the only thing is that its kinda bulky so you really can not wear it under clothes you just have to grin and wear it at first i felt silly but who cares i am doing this for me and i feel better already,1
gofit NUMBER lb walking vest this was a really good investment i use it during some of my aerobic exercise dvds and i walk jog run with it on the only negative is that you can not wear it on the outside of your clothing because it looks like a bulletproof vest and then there are a lot of eyes staring at you so i decided to wear it under my clothing it is a little bulky but it is not so bad i highly recommend it for someone who is new to to the vest it is economical and it will serve the purpose of helping togofit NUMBER pound walking vest with removable water bottle holdershed those pounds,1
gofit walking vest this vest was just as described and the fit was great it has wide shoulders so the comfort is good since i had never used a walking vest i wanted to start out as recommended with lighter than NUMBER pounds so removed some of the weights these were not so easy to get out of the pouches but that means they are securely held in place i am well pleased with this gofit walking vest,1
pretty these are very pretty but i did not use them on my tree since they look more hot pink than red in a few years as i add more colors to my tree i will have them,1
hard to heat i love bodysense products they stay hot for a long time i use them in my massage practice as hot packs the smell is great and it lasts quite awhile the only thing is as large as it is you need a big microwave to heat it i wind up folding it then it stops roatating so i have to stop and adjust it ugh it is a pain have not figured out how to arrange so it heats evenly otherwise i love it,1
great product i was hesitant to buy this for my new macbook pro but i am glad i did i took a little getting used to but it fits very well over the keys with minimal typing interference it not completely transparent so it does cloud the key symbols a little bit but not enough to make them unreadable in normal light or when the backlighting is on i do not have any problems with it sticking to the screen i have the regular not glossy screen when the cover is closed this is cheap insurance for your computer liquid spills into the keyboard of a laptop computer are a disaster the repair will be very expensive and will not be covered under warranty,1
great save for my mac from my toddler this little slipcover for my keyboard has saved the day for our family i feel safe leaving my NUMBER year old alone with his drinks watching my laptop now that he understands to keep the keyboard protector on really frees me up and helps me not worry about him ruining my computer so much anymore it would be even better if the edges were sticky enough to hold the cover on more securely but as is gives me much peace of mind i think everyone should have one of these,1
chirstian death metal yes my friends of this great indstry this is one of theworld finest albums of the decade NUMBER for so long metalhas been classified in a devilish class of its own but to bringlight in this world of maddness this group does indeed bring spiritual healing in there heavenly dark sound this groupdoes not exist anymore so anything that you buy of this bandis a collector piece do not delay on the purchase of this foryou will miss out on a treat if you are in to dark and evilsounds but do go to church you need to get this gift fromgod for this is your album filled with the truth if you arethe other guy still do not miss out on some good music big nutt,1
excellent value got these to put in my camper great for a low watt system i am surprised at the bass response in these little speakers i would not put them in a high power system they are rated at NUMBER watt but for a low watt system they sound very good and look great too,1
struggle of women i was disappointed in this book i am searching for a book that is equally as awesome as virtuous woman but it looks like kaye gibbons is not going to give it to us in this book the women are survivors because they have to be i was disappointed in the cold compassionless character of charlie kate her character shined through her words and actions beneath that arrogant surface lay a very insecure unsatisfied unfulfilled and angry person i can understand why she did not have a man who would want her her hatred of men i think was more of a jealousy she had no compassion so she tried to make up for it in her and she tried to hide behind those midwife skills although the book was long it was shallow and i expected a deeper plot,0
charms for the easy life gibbons weaves a compelling influencial novel about three generations of women and the lives they lived and their impact on one another detailed first person through margaret birch eye this story tells of margarget coming of age during world war NUMBER the book tells of margaret mother who constantly strives to be young and stylish and concequently is quite irresponsible and her grandmother a self proclaimed doctor who always seems to have the right answer as well as unconditoinal love for her grand daughter with whom she lives in a dramatic ending margaret realized that she has to move on from her sheltered home life and must learn to face the world on her own two feet,1
the best feel good look at life i have read i could not help comparing this novel to the book of ruth like ruth it is an intriguing look at the life of a girl growing up and the influence of family members on this growth but unlike ruth this book is positive this book is uplifting this book is a joy to read this book is about intelligence wit and love this is a book i like to write pick this one up then pass it along,1
dean send me your address dean love the book especially the pictures of gavin and me but you know that to anyone else who reads this dean knows whereof he speaks he a good hiker and builds a good environmentally sensitive campfire hope you do not mind my using this avenue to try to get your e mail address,1
no happy ending here be warned major spoiler do not read if you do not want to know before i invested time watching this i wish i had found a review saying there was a death of a major character at the end i would not have bothered it was not that good anyway maybe this review will save someone giving it NUMBER stars because i have seen abyssal films that only deserve NUMBER star and this is not that bad,0
probably the best movie ever this was a random movie i picked out on netflix to watch and i am so glad i did i laughed i cried i know it sounds cliche but what an amazing love story such a great message,1
loved i caught this movie today on lmn when i was channel surfing unfortunately i missed the first NUMBER minutes i tried not to let kent moran distract me from the plot but he gorgeous he a screenwriter musician and actor huh not just a pretty face anyways back to the movie it was a movie about real people that i could relate to i am buying this so i can see what i missed,1
to your heart directed by matt thompson great movie filmed in new york directed by matt thompson and written by kent moran scenes were filmed with the cam so it feels like you are right there with the actors it a great story about a high society deaf girl controlled by her mother and an ordinary who works for a living who fall in love his dream is music and so is hers even though she can not hear make sure to have your tissue ready for it will tug at your heart and the tears will come it has won many awards in the film festivals throughout the us one which was director at the beverly hills film festival it another love story movie worth watching,1
an ok book this is an ok book it is action packed and holds your attention i think that the main charecter dick shelton is a lot like many people today even though the book takes place in medieval times dick did not know that he was fighting for his enemy sir daniel the man who had killed his father i think this is one of the best historical fiction books that i have ever read i hope that you will like it as much as i did,1
not one of his best when comparing stevenson major works this book just does not compare it wooden stilted and written in the voice of northern uk speech,0
transitions i am an avid fan of dm and will do the best job at being objective about their work although i think this album is great and it has many quintessential dm songs there are some songs that i often skip over these songs are definitely not my favorites but i think mostly that they just do not appeal to me in the context of this album this is why i label this transitions i love all periods of dm but i notice this one seems to be one that incorporates the earlier new wave feeling of previous albums but also ushers in the darker era of dm i tend to prefer the darker dm but appreciate the earlier work especially if not simultaneously if you are even a slight fan of their work you will enjoy this album,1
trash this cd blows nothing worth listening to really sucks the big unit one of there worst cds thank you very muchyour welcome,0
unhappy constantly turns off very disappointed with this amp it has an auto shut off which is a cool feature however it randomly shuts off while in use very frustrating,0
simple amp this amp does what it is supposed to do only thing i was not aware of was that the ab speaker switches do not allow output to go to both speakers at the same time maybe this was in the write up but if so i missed it,1
too noisy an annoying amount of hum and hiss comes from my speakers the noise is still there without any inputs to the amplifier and it increases as i turn up the volume knob,0
just what i was looking for great amp for the speakers in my garage and lanai sounds great and easy to usesimple is good plus the price is right,1
works very well i have a whole house sound entertainment system which includes a pair of speakers in the dining room a pair of speakers in the living room and a pair of speakers in the bedroom i have a airportexpress connected directly to this unit and it has no problem powering all six pairs of in ceiling speakers in fact this unit is so powerful i can not turn the volume up beyond the midpoint because i fear that my windows will break an excellent product for the price note this unit has a single rca output so make sure you use a splitter if you intend to connect multiple pairs of speakers to this amplifier,1
horrible audio no teaching these other reviewers are kidding you there are significant problems with this dvd NUMBER the audio on this dvd is horrible it sounds like they are talking and singing through a tube i could have done better in my garage NUMBER the tracks are all the singing and stories in english or the same program in mandarin there is no teaching whatsoever i realize there are not many dvd for teaching children mandarin however there are a few better than this,0
not good unless you have a good knowledge of math i am not a math cripple but i will admit that i have not always been that great when it comes to math i have recently grown a hunger for science in general including mathematics of course and thought i should look for a book to help me grasp math from another perspective i actually read many of the pages in the book and while i did understand the first couple pages i found myself lost as i continue reading as another reviewer mentioned this is not a book for the layman i would not recommend this book to anyone who is not that good at math i guess i will just keep looking elsewhere to find books on the subject that will help me on my journey to become better at math,0
low budget cheap NUMBER film of pregnancy NUMBER or NUMBER college buds all court the same row captain and then she becomes pregnant focuses all around the bar and their goofiness when word comes out she has a kid they all rush not knowing who is the dad and they all step up but it is pretty playful and not realistic,0

a compelling biblical story this biblical fiction is a great introduction to the story of king hezekiah the characters have depth and i am eager to read the next book in the series,1
gods and kings chronicles of the kings was a great introduction to the series i gained a different insight into the history,1
god and kings chronicles of the kings NUMBER this was a great book to read i had a hard time putting it down can not wait to read the next one,0
history in action i love history especially biblical history and this book uses the information in the bible and then builds on that information with researched information to make it come alive it seemed like a long book at the start but it ended too soon,1
it send be back to the word loved the connection not only with history and the bible but also with lynn interpretation of the characters made me want to seek out the word in the kings and chronicles anything that leads us to the lord has to be great,1
did nothing i have no idea what all these reviews for this brand of dieters tea are talking about i followed the directions nothing happened brewed a stronger cup still nothing even measured out the water to NUMBER oz and let the tea bag seep for five minutes nothing just stronger tasting tea on the box it tells you not to drink more than NUMBER cup in a NUMBER hour period i drank three the other day not even thinking about it and nothing happened just tasted like cranberry tea and nothing else strange,0
did nothing i got the tea fast and followed the instructions only drinking NUMBER NUMBER cup which had no effect on my system it taste pretty good though,0
cossotto and kraus are favorites sometimes one forgets the great singers of but a few years ago this NUMBER performance recording made in tokyo though visually a bit dark is acoustically sparkling with the singers joy with donizetti music he would surely loudly applaud this effort both fiorenza cossotto and alfredo kraus are at their peak to say nothing of sesto bruscantini and ruggero raimondi in supporting roles this opera unfortunately is often overlooked for the better known donizetti works well worth enjoying as the music is grand the arias are among his finest and the ballet a treat to see,1
just plain awful the first and second robocop films were great i loved the over the top action and humor elements in both films robocop NUMBER is a pure unadulterated disaster first off it is way too tame a pg NUMBER rating second the plot is completely ruined by the introduction of the cute little kid who is a computer whiz character what a travesty third the movie is actually boring a boring robocop movie i could go on and on but why bother they dare to put this garbage on dvd,0
junk when a movie has dialogue like i thought your ninja was supposed to take care of robocop it ai not going to be citizen kane it will not even be a good robocop movie but if you must indulge look for the strings holding up robocop when he flies yes i said look for the strings holding up robocop when he flies,0
excellent stories so so analysis i enjoyed all but one of the NUMBER stories in this book from NUMBER to NUMBER even though i did not enjoy pamela zoline the heat death of the universe i can see why it is an important story to include in this collection of some of the science fiction that can be seen as feminist seen as feminist here is the key i think especially when you look at the essays paired with each story a few of the essays were spot on looked at the author and the story in their historical context others rambled between sharing previous scholarship and trying to find multiple readings of the material one of which was a feminist interpretation the NUMBER stories are intense and moving challenging the reader while entertaining i loved that they were organized chronologically because i could see a flow and development of the feminist voice i wish a concluding essay had tied them all together to bring this out more,1
poor attempt for a rock album everything about album makes me want to grab a gun and shoot myself that how bad it is it lacks emotion and it sounds forced like they are trying to hard to spread the word instead of trying to make good music everything about this cd is so generic so dull so predictable only a moron would think this is a worth while cd to listen too,0
i am mesmerized this book is so mesmerizing try perla at the mexican border p NUMBER her job was to sort through the eyes of dolls snapping hollow limbs into plastic torsos had been a soothing task for perla like arranging the peas into the pod beautiful imagery in very simple moments gonzalez does not take anything for granted small moments become big ones this is exemplary poetry i recommend this to everyone i know the nps made a great choice,1
the train delivers originally i purchased this book because my granddaughter name is sophia and i know how little ones enjoy stories that include their name but i would purchase this book for a little one just because it is a good book the pictures are bright and bold the text right at the level of a preschooler and it opens up to display a long train a fun book to read together,1
ohh god its those troma freaks again i must say that even for troma this one was pretty bad a plane crash leaves tourists stranded on a tropical island that happens to be the home base of a group of nasty terrorists now think troma how would you work with this plot needless to say there are many dead before it ends i thought there was a limit to the amount of blood and guts one could put into a movie and smear on a woman breasts untill i saw war the movie is rather low quality not like some of the newer troma releases but if you like classic troma it dos not get any more classic than this not one for the kiddies,0

not a true cd audio or dvd audio disc i am a big bjork fan i am also a big fan of the higher fidelity dvd audio format and remastered cd sound although some remasters are atrocious so i thought this disc was a great buy however i was not pleased to find that the cd audio side will not play in the car or on the computer as it not recognized as a cd audio disc apparently not uncommon with dual discs just as frustrating is the lack of true dvd audio using mlp meridian lossless which is superior to the dolby and dts surround sound provided here interestingly my computer was happy to read the dvd side but reports the surround sound as NUMBER NUMBER for both dolby and dts not the NUMBER NUMBER claimed if you are looking for the superior audio you thought this disc offered then you will need to be happy playing it on your dvd player only disappointing i already own the videos on dvd so i have not taken that into consideration in this review,0
missing most of the play this version of the play is missing acts iii and iv act iv scene ii contains some of the most famous lines of shakespeare fear no more the heat of the sun so if you need this play are crunched for time and need it to supplement a research paper on stream of consciousness and mrs dalloway i would definitely get another version thanks a lot for the complete rip off,0
duplicate dvd this is the same dvd that i had previously purchased with a different cover i will keep it because i like the workout and the previous dvd skips in places,0
different this cd was alot different than waiter the first track is the next eight put together long ambiant phases between dark synth driven songs much more digital than the pervious album his vice is possibly better in this cd definatly worth the ep price,1
do not buy i have been buying these before from microcenter they are very cheap and i thought it was a very good deal particularly their NUMBER mah for NUMBER bucks but cons of all the nimh batteries i tried this has the most number of failures some just dies some would hold very low charges after just a few cycles it is bigger in circumference compared to other batteries which will not fit some of my cameras and gadgets exterior is made of paper and gets easily smashed deformed pros price but for this kind of quality not worth it also with all the new low discharge batteries flooding the market eneloops rayovacs duracell kodak etc there is no longer any reason to buy this kind of batteries even this company is now manufacturing their own hybrio,0

bloody awful i found this novel to be cumbersome and uninspiring there was not one likable character i wanted to take frances by the shoulders and shake some sense into her,0
typical rightwing garbage the book pretty much presents itself the opposite of what it claims to be about how can you just expect teenagers to avoid the dangers if you do not allow them to be well educated about it remember the just say no program that was supposed to bring down drug addiction well telling teenagers simply not to do it only encouraged more of the same and it certainly no different when it comes to sex no wonder the bible belt has higher cases of teen pregnancy for following dobson pathetic advice whereas the west coast and the northeast have far lower numbers and percentages of teen pregnancy by providing sex education to students if you are going to read this book be warned that the author is just another rightwing special interest hack,0
preparing for adolescence it was so true and definitely helpful teenagers will find encouragement because someone took the time to explain all those confusing changes they go through,1
rational anti mysticism healthy debunking islamic mysticism a secular perspective by ibn al rawandi prometheus books any believer needs to fairly read some debunking views of one beliefs first it is always important to know other points of view even if they do not persuade or even tend to subvert the truth of the positions one holds as true and life saving this book offers a critique of the sufi path of transformation by a former seeker who feels there is serious deception and self deception on the spiritual path and it is better to be rational and consistent in one views than to seek fantastical delusions now such a position is unlikely to appeal to the mystic but if one wants to mature in one mysticism one should give such nay sayers a careful hearing concede their good points and carefully critique the limitations of their point of view otherwise perhaps such rationalists are correct and such pursuits are bunk,1
scholarly critical analysis of islamic religion history rawandi contends that reliable sources undermine the classical account of islam and sufism and his study seeks to rectify this imbalance through studying the philosophy of religion and traditionalists to provide a new critical analysis of islam readers already well versed in islamic religion and history will find this a scholarly detailed probe,1

ionic breeze review i bought this product for the girlfriend who happens to be be a smoker her car always smelled really bad abviously i purchased this to try and curb the smell and surprisingly despite the small size of this product it works very well keeps the car smelling fresh even after being smoked in,1
funny and smart these guys are really a good match together so funny and fun to watch with the family i wish it had the thin man which for some reason i thought this had but i ended up getting the thin man collection later anyways,1
i know i am biased but this is a beautifully presented box set of powell loy which gives youan insight to films they made together other than the thin man seriesthe clarity of the discs and the sound quality surprised me consideringthe films age as for the actors i would buy a film of powell and loy shopping inwal mart i am that easily pleased but if you want to see the golden ageof hollywood and a mixture of drama and screwball comedy at its bestthen look no further,1
run do not hide while this book did not scare me i found it laughable and largely useless for the majority of twin carrying women who like and trust their obgyns believe that pain is generally to be avoided and are actually comforted by the fact that institutions such as hospitals exist also i found the book highly offensive in that it strongly suggested that miscarriage in twin pregnancies is caused by a mother doubts about carrying twins gee what a wonderful guilt trip to impose on a grieving mother,0
depressing and scary i read this book while i was pregnant with my twin daughters and found it incredibly depressing and scary it was filled with morbid quotes from parents who had a bad outcome along the lines of when not even one of the triplets lived i went out and got drunk and seemed to dwell on every possible problem and complication to the point that i was quite stressed and anxious when in fact my twins were born naturally five days before the predicted due date had none of the complications this horrible book made me worry about and were in excellent health in fact i so dislike the book that i go out of my way to warn expectant parents of twins to avoid it in addition the dietary advice is ridiculous and it impossible for even a hearty eater to consume the massive amounts of food this writer claims are necessary to having a healthy baby so unless you like being scared i recommend against buying this book,0

disco queen queen loved to experiment every time they released a new song i would hear it and say in delight is that queen however this album abandoned all that was rock and roll and gave into the pop craze of disco that can only be classified as the dark ages in pop music the only bright spot from this album was under pressure thankfully they pulled out of it to cement themselves as one of the greatest rock bands of all time,0

wonderful collection i had enough of a balance on a gift card for one cd after listening to samples of selections from liona boyd ana vidovic susan isbin and martha masters i came across this one i listed to the samples over and over and finally ordered it largely because i liked the sounds of the duet once i received the cd and played the selections all the way through i think i made the right choice this is a superb collection these two ladies brilliantly blend melodies and harmonies with a little dissonance thrown in here and there i have had it for a few months now and it still as fresh as when i first listened to it you know sometimes when you get a new cd you are hyped up on it and listen to it over and over but then after a while it takes its place amongst the rest of your collection not this one for me whenever i need to wind down this is the one i listen to and i have not grown tired of it yet,1

disappointing i give this collection of sonatas only two stars because the way they were recorded only allows two fifths of them to play on my bose i returned them once received a quick replacement the same most of them have to be played in the car also i believe barenboim plays some of the sonatas too fast just because he can,0
loud fast heavy yet unbelievably catchy i first heard of these guys in a short article of guitar world and later found this cd at a music show for pretty cheap and decided to pick it up while the songs are very heavy complete with loud vocals humorous lyrics heavy fast power chords and screaming solos what do you expect from a NUMBER punk band np proves to the world that they play what they want to and not what the public wants to hear their live shows sound very interesting complete with a fire breathing bassist and crazy stage antics if you like it loud and fast give this one a try you got to love the cover too heh,1

linen chef jacket this chef coat is very very large i ordered a med if you are a ladies size NUMBER or larger this may fit you but the coat has no shaping whatsoever so you will look like a big marshmallow mine is white also where the collar meets at the neck has a very large space which is not traditional and looks very odd the fabric quality is ok which for the price is not so great perhaps this was cut for men but the buttons and fabric would make it too girly this coat design needs to be amended and shaped and the overlap where the buttons cross over needs to be re thought as the fabric hangs down and bunches under the coat so the bottom hem is not it needs a button underneeth or something to stop that from happening,0
one of the greatest plays in english literature i have read this play and also performed the part of joan on stage many times shaw play brings the soul of joan to life a girl with no formal education defeated the english won a crown for a king and was tried and burned as a witch dead at or under the age of NUMBER no wonder she was made a saint the story would almost be a horrible fairy tale if it was not true,1
gorgeous music gorgeously played i will not usually recommend a mono cd unless there is no other version of the work in question or the performance is superlative well there are many recent cds filled with the antique music but none bear up so well as the amadeus reissue of the NUMBER instrumental music of NUMBER amd NUMBER as performed by the concentus musicus wien under nikolaus harnoncourt the man who was one of the pioneers of period instruments in recordings here we have NUMBER cuts of music from france du tertre du caurroy england holborne morley tomkins cooper bevin germany sommer posch scheidt and italy cabrielli gumai massaino all of which is available elsewhere and perhaps some of which is played as well and in better sound i will deduct a rating point however for its short running time of NUMBER minutes but all in all this is gorgeous music gorgeously played,1
if you read only NUMBER book about the death penalty read this this well written book examines virtually all arguments regarding the death penalty in addition to exposing current practices just revenge also puts the death penalty in an historical context its inevitable conclusion as it demolishes every well cherished but incorrect justification for the death penalty with the exception of a clause in the NUMBER th amendment is that the only thing proponents have left on their side is indeed just revenge mark costanzo own opinion is clear virtually from the start but he backs it up with fact after devastating fact if you want to learn more about the death penalty this is an excellent place to begin it is also a useful reference book as it is chock full of statistics and anecdotes,1

poor product from dishonest dealer ordered two and billed for two as christmas presents received one which was a misassembled plastic piece of garbage oh well my fault for buying jewelry over the net should at least receive what i ordered however so i wrote the dealer to either send the second one or issue a refund never could get a reply threw the one that had arrived in the trash would have given this a negative rating if NUMBER were not the lowest number available,0
unseen is the word i read this book two years ago and had the opportunity to participate in an interview with the author on national public radio ms gibbons was gracious of course but she could not answer the obvious difficulties in this book the chronology is confused and while the book reaches for important issues ie the need for a young girl to have a mother the treatment of the characters is shallow the longing is there and it is expressed well but ultimately the miraculous healing of the mother and her immediate death after her restoration undermine whatever strength was in the novel the one character that the reader has no trouble believing is pearl the caring maternal housekeeper she is a jewel of characterization much needed and appreciated in this novel,0
definitely not prodigy best material maybe it because i have been listening to the energetic and inspired electronic music of german industrial ebm for the past few years or perhaps it just prodigy did not put enough effort into this release whatever the reason i can not recommend this single baby got a temper just does not catch the attention of my ears in ways it does mimic the style of a few of prodigy past songs with the break beats and repeating synth lines but it just can not match the magic of their former hits like breathe and firestarter the remixes of baby got a temper are not really that much to look forward to on this single either even die hard prodigy fans should find somewhere to listen to this single first before buying it hopefully prodigy upcoming album will incorporate some more inspired songs for redemption from this lackluster single,0
great tune the prodigy are back baby got a temper is a fantastic record just whatwe need right now in an age where all the music industryhas to offer is endless dire amounts of pop garbage the only bad thing i have to say about this great cd isthat the other mixes do not vary too much from the originaltrack being a dub and instrumental respectively i wouldhave preferred a couple of new tracks that said baby got a temper is such a great catchy song that i still enjoy the other versions and ijust can not get enough of the tune itself anyway great video too absolutely recommended,1
one of the best metal albums of all time the first song i heard on this album was bounce and to be quite honest i was not impressed but i saw the cd at best buy and thought why not i must say it has not been something i have regretted this is nu metal years ahead of any other band you will find out there with insightful underlying political protest all the way through but if you want an album to just rock out to well this is actually an amazing choice anyway there is some amazing stuff here like chop suey a deeply touching disturbing song about the unpleasant topic of suicide and toxicity a song about the terrible disorder in the world with the split of rage against the machine there is little possible competition for system on their way to the nu metal top,1
good but does not top the first one as much as i enjoyed system of a down first effort it took me a long time to get into this one but i guess i am like that with every new cd a band comes out with anyway i think that on this cd serj shows more of his vocal ability to go really high than down to a near death metal scream in prison song but i was disapointed that the drummer did not do any crazy drum solos as he did on the band self titled debut all in all i really enjoyed this cd and i would highly recommend for anyone who is starting to get into metal or into system of a down the single chop suey is definitely one of the songs where the bands demonstrates the most musical talent in my opininon although the sound of the song is a bit more radio friendly than the rest of the cd it is still a great song another song with great talent is the song toxicity which has proven to become my favorite on this multi faceted album,1
cool awsome cd almost evry song is worth listening to prison song pogo and chop suey are all realy good,1
overall pretty good i am going to make this short and sweet it not the greatest album in the world because i still can not listen to the whole thing straight through but i just have to say that toxicity is one of my most favorite songs in the world you just can not beat the guitars in this song and the drums are amazing chop suey is also great it got interesting allusions to god and jesus psycho is good headbanging fun and warns you to stay away from cocaine too and aerials is nice and meaningful oh and bounce is hilarious but i will leave it up to you to buy the album and figure out what they are really talking about,1
bad deal listin to the velvet underground murder mystery and then listen to chop suey you can not tell me they did not rip that intro from the velvets i do not care about this cd i just felt like saying that they ripped the velvet underground murder mystery off,0
i may have enjoyed this album had i been deaf i may have enjoyed this album had i been NUMBER years old or deaf strangely enough i listen to new and old metal but there is somethin about this band i do not like NUMBER his voice is very annoying from the get go where are they going with this garbage its been awhile since weve seen some fresh new metal music that is decent and i have a feeling something is coming cause if it isnt i do not think this genre will be pop much longer,0
real good music this cd is really really awesome it not that i only like this heavy metal rock genre quite frankly i like every type of music besides country that is heh this is a review coming a person who likes everything from dido to disturbed rap rock whatever i like it all this is just a really good cd for anyone who likes any music at all and also has very good taste very great work from soad that should be enjoyed by everyone,1
one of systems best albums along with their self titled album these two are the best albums i have heard ever by any group,1
awesome this is one bad rear group i have both of their albums and the only problem is that i listen to them so much that i can not get the songs out of my head killer lyrics and wonderful beats you will not be disappointed,1
bunch of garbage there is only NUMBER good songs on this cd and you here them on the radio all the time this is depressing dreadful music i wanted to slash my wrist after listening to it but instead i broke it and toss it in the trash can were it belongs,0
shock to the system upon hearing the song toxicity on mtv i had absolutely no hesitation in buying this album knowing that it would contain at least one gem what i did not expect was such consistency initially tracks like x and forest do not stand out as much as mtv hits chop suey and toxicity however on further listens you will discover that it is the lesser known tracks that hold your interest and ensure this album stays in your cd player for a while i now hope to see these guys live at some stage to see if the energy displayed on this album translates as well in live performance,1
buy this cd this is a great cd i have listened to this cd probably NUMBER times and it never gets old all the songs are good,1
complete liberal garbage this music is sooo old and tired these punks are your typical angry californians you know the ones lets all riot and then cry discrimination when the police arrest us for commiting crimes lets overthrow the corupt government the government puts too many people in jail etc etc blah blah anyway musically the cd is average and lirically the cd is terrible only a cute video and mtv air play have brought commercial success to these sad sacks,0
um ok chop suey is the only good song on this cd if u expect that this cd will be like there last lp that where your wrong they seem to have a christian gospel touch insted more of a heavy metal rock touch if u want some real metal rock try slipknot static x disturbed slayer pentara and more artists like that,0

global puzzle poor adam crall reviewer cameroon is its own french speaking nation in africa it is not in south africa which is also an independent nation,0
cool puzzle not highest quality pieces we are really enjoying this puzzle and learning a lot the information written on the oceans makes the puzzle more interesting and manageable the pieces are necessarily very small to match the size of the countries the bigger problem is that they curl up just a bit so the pieces do not lie flat as you make the puzzle this is frustrating and you do not get that satisfying feeling as you put a piece in as you have to press it down a few times and it still does not quite flatten down i am trying covering the finished puzzle with heavy books but i suspect it just a problem of cheap glue still i give it four stars since a good world puzzle is very hard to find and the content is good,1
i will pass on this next time bought NUMBER of these with the idea of keeping one and giving the other to my mother neither worked well and failed soon after using the seller was magnificent and refunded our money,0
new developments for the middle of a series i thought that this was a positive development in the series bringing in new characters and expanding on the plot world development the first part is devoted to developing new characters and expanding threads while the last third is action with the characters this has a lot of foreshadowing and will fit in with follow books and new series overall worthwhile reads best when in conjunction with the other books in the series,1
another top notch film about victoria by victoria victoria hamilton seems to pop up everywhere whether in lesser parts as in pride and prejudice in bad girl parts such as in mansfield park or in this delightful version of the complex relationship between victoria and albert this one needs to be compared with a somewhat different interpretation of the relationship in the young victoria victoria handling of her long period of grief over albert death is also well done in mrs brown for english history lovers all of these are worth viewing interesting and nicely filmed,1
pure pop for moog people electronic power pop that sounds fresh to this day the beats are more bubblegum punk than straight up dance music the songs have hooks the archies would kill for catchy and completely addictive you can bet your modern day synthpop bands like ladytron freezepop hyperbubble and bis listened to this stuff in their sleep many say it depeche mode at their best many disagree whatever the case there no other dm album like it and every song is great if you eat this electrocandy up and want more there are a few more speak and spell moments on dm second album comment why no voting buttons we do not let customers vote on their own reviews so the voting buttons appear only when you look at reviews submitted by others,1
satisfying your supernatural cravings if you like battles against ultimate evil religious overtones and special effects with a twist rent constantine yes you have to suspend disbelief yes you have to accept somewhat two dimensional personalities but if you get past that you get a nicely shot tense supernatural crime saga with a couple of interesting characters most folks will have never heard of constantine or hellblazer on which the movie is loosely based but it fine if you have not the movie is good enough on its own for an enjoyable night,1
lamebrain to the hill lamebrain film that not only rips off a much better film out there the prophecy but also lacks the thrills that movie had in spades keanu reeves is still his same self here which means that he gives another boring acting turn his fellow co stars do far more in their parts with rachel weisz being the stand out giving a great performance that has resonance and guts djimon hounsou is good as well but he barley in the film plus peter stormare and tilda swinton have great cameos that really should have been bigger roles weisz hounsou stormare and swinton give far more acting weight to this lame brain horror movie than it deserved and for that they are worthy of the praise especially rachel weisz who does lift this movie above the mediocre garbage it really is but regardless of their worthy acting turns the movie is plague by a script that really does not make any sense and a director who does no know how to direct a movie,0
overblown mess this is bad really perhaps it is one of those movies which can only be fully understood or enjoyed if familiar with the comic that originated it it does not even have the redeeming quality of being a decent action film guilty of the worst capital sin of the kingdom of entertainment boring boring and boring for that alone it will burn in cinematic hell,0
where is mystery science theater NUMBER when you really need it extremely awful keanu reeves stinker that not only lives up to the word of mouth but surpasses it in spades keanu proves once and for all on how bad an actor he is with a groundbreaking bad performance and a script that helps him out a lot in proving that only his co stars come out of this film with their heads held up high with great performances by rachel weisz djimon hounsou and peter stormare but not even their great performances can salvage this disaster this is fresh material for the show mystery science theater NUMBER and i hope they can get a print of this movie and tear it apart for the garbage it really is,0
weak very weak dumb keanu reeves horror epic that is not only the actors worse film by far but a bad film in it own right keanu is just wrong for the role and the script is joke in many ways most of the performances are not very good shia labeouf was horrible and made keanu look like an oscar winner by comparison the only performance of merit is that of rachel weisz and she literally keeps you glued to your seat with her powerful and emotional performance unfortunately while she gives her all the rest of the movie is in self destruction mold all around her with bad special effects very bad dialog and a story that makes no sense what so ever i stand with the majority rachel weisz is the only good thing about this film so wait for dvd to see this film and in the mean time rent runaway jury or the shape of things two very good movies that compliment weisz performance unlike this one does,0
should have read the reviews before i saw it terrible adaptation of the great comic book hellblazer is nothing short of a spit in the eye of the fans of the comic book with a terrible and down right crude performance by keanu reeves who makes a joke out of one of the most beloved cult comic book characters made in the last twenty years his performance is bad to the point of wanting to throw something at the screen just out of sheer rage the screenplay is a joke and the dialog rages from bad to much worse as the movie progresses and the special effects are so badly done that the monsters would have been better off if they were puppets instead some of the actors in the film are better than the film itself with great performances by rachel weisz who is the only ray of light this movie really has and djimon hounsou who is the only actor who does his comic book character any justice despite rachel weisz the movie is bad and not even her talent could have saved it,0
finally i can pre order the dvd i have not been able to get this movie out of my head i love it it was such a brilliant take on the comic book adaption sure i was disappointed at first about the casting choice to play constantine but it turned out so much better than i expected and i grew to love it i can not wait for a sequel reeves did an outstanding job capturing the spirit of john constantine and rachel weisz gave her all the two had such great chemistry and i am thankful they did not overplay the relationship thing by not overfluffing the movie it a great flick you should consider adding this to your collection kudos to francis lawrence for doing such an outstanding job as a first time movie director,1
creepy cool constantine has accepted his fate and made peace with it he knows that death and a hellish afterlife are imminent flawed and fatalistic cigarette between his fingers he plods along throwing himself into one horrific situation after another in an effort to help a woman he does not even know it creepy and powerful angels devils and friends the guilty and innocent keanu reeves is perfect in this role and it a movie to watch again and again liked it a lot reminds me of sandman slim stories,1
why did warner brothers release this garbage this movie is garbage stay home and save your money my friendsand i were trying to stay awake through the entire film although i do not know why sleeping would have been a more productive use of our time rather than wasting time trying to figure out this film when the old tired plot finally starts to unravel we did not care what was going on i felt that the actors are an insignificant part of this movie they do not matter in other words this film is so bad it does not matter who was in front of the camera no one could save this trash the film is very dark shot like a low budget film with a few special effects my friends and i can honestly say that we did not like anything about this film,0
yay some wear and tear on the case but other than that the dvd itself works great thanks so much,1
good movie this is a decent movie to get a good fright to lol just as good as when i saw it in theaters i have the dvd and blu ray now time to ditch the dvd lol NUMBER stars,1
what the hell were they thinking horrible adaptation of the vertigo comic book is not only a smack in the face of the followers of the book with a flat out moronic screenplay that takes all the good out of the comic but also has the worse actor to play the title role of john constantine keanu reeves not only makes the role into a joke with his lack of talent but makes everyone around him look bad as well the cinematography is ugly making the movie a real eye sour and the special effects lack a certain feel to it out of the entire cast only rachel weisz comes out with her dignity intact with a very good performance that the movie squanders in order to let keanu act like a darker version of his neo character towards the latter half of the film they should have taken the material seriously and made a great horror movie out of it but instead we have a children movie that geared to matrix heads avoid this film like the plague,0
awful my goodness i rented this movie expecting a scary thriller and it almost put me to sleep this is keanu reeves sorriest performance to date not that he has had many good ones his acting was horrible in this movie and the whole movie did not make sense and was just plain boring to watch i was very disappointed for this film is just plain awful,0
dumb and pretty bad what do you get when you have an actor who can not act a director who can not direct and a script that is so badly written that you will be laughing your head off at the same time you are throwing up at the pure stupidity of it you get one of the worse movies ever made keanu reeves performance in this film is so bad it makes his bill and ted movies look oscar worthy the direction from first time director frances lawrence is flat out horrible with lousy direction and murky cinematography and the script is so badly written that you are really surprise by what you are hearing from the actors mouths from time to time of all the actors involved only rachel weisz and are able to come out of this horrible film with their dignity intact with good performance that this movie really did not deserved other than them almost everybody involved should hang their heads in shame for making such a bad movie,0
pure stupidly horrible and down right stupid keanu reeves action horror movie not only makes the people who pay to see it look stupid but it solidify him as one of the worse actors of our generation with a horrible performance that makes everything about this film into a joke i feel sorry for his fellow actors which includes rachel weisz who give the movie only real performance for even being on the same screen with him because despite their good work and effort he manages to make the movie into a real choir to watch the word of mouth is justified for this piece of garbage,0
pretty bad very bad keanu reeves film that could be one of the worse films ever made keanu sinks it up so badly that he should be thrown out of hollywood all together and they should include the director and the screenwriters as well because the movie is as bad as keanu performance out of the entire cast only rachel weisz gives a real performance in this movie and she is so good in fact that she does almost redeems the entire film but not even her great talent could save it from the script which is excruciatingly bad and the direction which is as bad as the script and lacks focus for what its trying to accomplish the story makes no sense and manages to go against itself in certain scenes and the climax literally destroys the narrative that the movie was trying to build up maybe asking for a competed director and a lead actor who can act was a tall order for the producers of this film,0
makes hellboy look like a masterpiece dimwitted supernatural thriller that is a major bore for the most part with a dimwitted performance by keanu reeves who is miscast in the main role and a screenplay that is as stupid as it can be a lot has been said about rachel weisz being the only good thing that this movie has to offer and i will agree with that assessment because she does make you care about what is going on with the movie while you are trying to figure out a way to care about the dumb story that is being told weisz performance is much too rich and powerful for a movie like this and she gives you a reason to stick around while in essence there is no reason to even stay till the end hellboy was a masterpiece compared to this and that was marginal decent for what it was at the very best for weisz rich and powerful performance i give the movie two stars if she were not in the movie my rating would be in negative numbers NUMBER,0
not even a b movie a z minus movie truly a pathetic film the only few minutes of the film that was interesting was the very beginning after this it raced downhill the demons and characters were all unbelievable except for the female lead i can not fathom the audience for this film except for the blind deaf and dumb i have never been a fan of keanu reeves but some of his films have been exciting he brought nothing to this nothing it is hard to tell whether the fault is the script the director or the actor in short the film was a total waste of time more than that it was a total theft of time,0
comment on constantine i did not like the movie as the dialogue was whispered and it was difficult to understand what was being said and to make it even more objectionable the audio level would overwhelm when the scene cut to an action event the audio level had to be constantly adjusted and the picture was not very sharp even with a hi def monitor it is suggested amazon get a limiting amplifier or one of the old cbs audiomax units like tv broadcasters used in the NUMBER to prevent the commercials audio levels from annoying the viewers run all movies through an audio processor and get this under control jim,0
this was the worse horrible can not describe this movie in a right light this was the worse film i have seen in years and this should prove once and for all on how bad keanu reeves is as an actor because he at his worse in this film he so bad that he has the uncanny ability to make you feel stupid once the movie is over that how bad he is the script is a huge mess and most of it does not make sense what so ever and the picture is way too dark in certain areas of the film rachel weisz is great in the movie but she basically carrying keanu on her shoulders during most of the film while he over acts in horrific ways and she is stranded with a story that really should have had a good rewrite before it became a shooting script other than her the movie is just a huge help of crap that should not have been made,0
rachel weisz is great but the movie is a disaster not very good horror action movie that has the right stuff but lacks a certain amount of credibility to mix keanu reeves is semi fine but miscast and he lacks a character the audience can root for and the rest of the movie is hit or miss in terms of the script which is badly written and the special effects which are not up to par in terms of what has been accomplish recently i have to agree with what has been said about rachel weisz who is the heart and soul of this movie and she does lift it over the mediocre script and funny dialog her performance is golden and worthy of a much better movie see it for her alone but you will end up feeling sorry for her for being the only good thing about the whole movie,0
additional info did not see this listed but if you put the supplimental disc in an x box you can play the constantine video game,1
good strong tires i brought this tires for a friend in NUMBER x NUMBER NUMBER she has not had a problem nor has she had a flat and she loves them,1
be careful i bought this tire for asphalt and cement roads like it name city ride but after using them for some monthsi noticed that if you have them with too much pressure the on bumps the bike can hit pretty hard and you can lose the control if you are not prepared better to use low pressure but the most problematic situation is the grip i got into an emergency brake a car show up in front of me the driver was distracted then the tire was completely stopped but slipping because it has zero grip because the center part which that is smooth is too wide i am planning to create some groove to them just to using some more time if you want your life do not buy this tire i trust continental but this was a failure i can not imagine this tire in rainy conditions,0
praise the lord i found this book very useful being a practicing christan and not being into wicca or witchcraft i have never had the occassion to purchase a book on candle burning before now i had always associated such practices and being associated with satan worship boy was i dead wrong the author says that candle burning is a positive force in the universe and not at all negative like i had thought i got out my bible and did one or two of the candle burning spells and found that the room was immediately energized with white light all around i felt very peaceful i had wanted to help someone in my family overcome a bad situation in their life its somewhat of a personal matter so i will not go into it here and a few days later i received a phone call from the family member and it turned out what i had prayed for using this book came about i have given this book to others to use and they also report very positive benefits so i would recommend it to anyone who asked,1
waste waste waste all i reall have to say is this book is a complete waste of time and money do not bother,0
good for price yellow plastic not matched to metal portions perfectly but okay it was good for the price still do not know what the reference to gerber was,1
inedible i made this gum with my NUMBER and NUMBER year old daughters i ended up making NUMBER NUMBER of the recipe myself the gum is impossible to stir and never had a smooth consistancy the food coloring red and blue stain everything and is impossible to get off of your hands you have to use you hands to knead the gum the worst part is that even after all of that the gum tasted terrible i highly doubt that the manufacturer truely tested this process with parents and children frustrating and a waste of time,0
delivery time too slow from the time of order to receipt the book took longer than any vendor i have ordered from previously there were no courtesy notification of when the item was sent to gauge the time of delivery the condition of the book was as promised overall i would not order from the same vendor again,0
the black crowes are incredible one of the last great southern rock bands is back and in a big way by your side is a great cd which conveys the southern rock and roll styles that has been sorely missed for the past few years this is true rock and roll at it finest if you enjoy aerosmith or the rolling stones i recommend this cd the first single kickin my heart around sums up what the crowes are about they might not have the most talent in the world but they are great at what they do rock hard a must hear,1
man of many trades this book taught that we can master more than one trade that we should invest in ourselves and be our own bosses that organization begins at home and more,1
at first he seems just an ordinary kid but wow what a life this is a marvelous book and an easy read even though ben franklin seemed to be just an average guy as you read about him accomplishing one thing after another you get a sense of his magnificence as a man i wish i had read this book when i was a kid perhaps a little of the diligence that is portrayed on every page would have rubbed off on me the autobiography is amazing in a low key ben franklin sort of way,1
good insight to ben franklin i had heard many different things about ben franklin one of the historical figures in the establishment of the united states this book confirmed some things i had heard and debunked some others good book,1
i wish i had read this earlier this book was written to instruct and encourage young people men in those days but it can apply to anyone to live a simple and productive life franklin learned early the unpleasantness of being in debt and in trouble with others and made for himself a rule of life which he strove daily to adhere to he quickly learned that advice from others can be mistaken and the necessity of evaluating what others prescribed he gives a good account of a prudent life but does not spare himself clearly declaring when he was at fault or mistaken i wish i had read this when i was young i might have been more consistent and productive,1
ben franklin do not believe we received this book could you verify where it was sent and whenwas this a kindle fire book,0
boring i was hoping to really get in to this but it was to boring for me so that is why it is one star,0
not for the southern hemisphere quite a well thought out book to take around with you but limited use to me as there are no southern hemisphere maps or details even the southern cross is absent would not have purchased it had i realised at least it was cheap,0
johny heeering i am a fan i didn t dig it the magic just is not here anymore i think that every cramps fiend affection comes from the fact that these guys struggled through pretty much every kind of hardship a band can face except for a lack of purpose drive and motivation throughout the wild and wooly days of the early punk scene even the punks did not get these guys this album is just too artificial sounding to be a real cramp album it sounds like a novelty album for kids i loved sinners though and for that i gave it another star,0
kindle version you can not search terms every time you try using kindle search it brings up on average over NUMBER pages this is not worth almost NUMBER dollars for kindle version your better off with print the kindle is not designed to scroll pages quickly say like when your with friends,0
almost too bad for mst NUMBER k this was one of the worst sci fi movies ever you have to turn the car off or the em pulse will fry it pretty sure it will still fry the electronics when it off probably will not kill you though the big army truck gets fried as do the guys in it and the good dr says it fried the the battery and starter he whips out his cute little red tool box and swaps the battery and alternator from their jeep liberty and the big diesel starts yeah right apparently the biggest nuclear bombs ever made are pretty light it only took four guys to load them into the truck how did they get them into the russian sub that just happened to be on the west coast an old russian diesel sub can make it to the bottom of the marianas trench NUMBER NUMBER feet down really and the guy with the pacemaker why did not the earlier em pulses fry his pacemaker these are just some of the gross abuses of reality there are many more do not bother unless you want something to laugh at in disbelief,0
really works NUMBER star because it is messy but this is amazing i have used the freeze away crap and it does not work and is too expensive this is cheap and will work within two uses make sure you wrap the area tight though,1
success at last like many others i struggled for months with an inconveniently located wart on my finger i tried three NUMBER other kinds of retail removal products and i was thinking that perhaps i was just out of luck then i read through the reviews for this pedifix wart stick and was encouraged enough to try one more time the product arrived quickly and my wart friend is almost gone excellent,1
disappointment after reading all the great reviews i was thinking that this stuff was really strong and going to work i was expecting to feel a light burning sensation so i could tell that it was working i tried using this several times and it did nothing i do not know if i just got a bad one because it looked like it was somewhat melted when i opened it too me i felt like i was putting chapstick on a wart and hoping it would work,0
does not work good very disapointed i purchased this product due to all the great reviews i have used this on my daughters leg for several weeks and still nothing my daughters leg looks to be rubbed raw but there has been no progress with her warts i am very disapointed with this medicine,0
terrible product bought this to remove a wart weeks later of apply several times a day minimal results i threw it away what a joke i did then buy trichloroacetic acid NUMBER and boom the wart was gone more expensive but cheaper than buying the freeze away over and over,0
not worth it i had a bunch of plantars warts on my heel that had been there for a while and just kept multiplying i was under the impression that they had to be removed by a doctor until i saw this product i immediately ordered it and began using it religiously a couple weeks passed and i did not see a change in the warts the skin around them was not looking so good but the warts were still thriving i read online that a lot of people have luck with apple cider vinegar so i tried that much better results forget this product just go to the store and get some acv cotton balls and duct tape,0
so far i am impressed purchased this product a few weeks ago for my tween son he started with one wart on his foot but soon others developed previously we were using dr sch for several weeks and it just had a minor effect on the warts so after some research i decided to give pedifix a shot it is working very effectively so far no pain at all when he applies it this is my NUMBER st review written on amazon but not my NUMBER st reading of reviews i glean a lot of info from reading and analyzing reviews i am glad i chose this product,1
great item i think this item worked excellent compared to the other liquid based removers which seem to take forever to work my foot doctor recommended this to me and it hard to find in local stores it is stronger so watch you do not use too much because your skin will get irritated around the wart site one tip my dr gave me was to use a q tip to scoop some out and then apply to the wart that way you do not re infect yourself i would definately purchase this again,1
looks like chap stick i got the wart stick for my grand daughter NUMBER yrs old she has a wart on her hand and foot but i was afraid to give it to her or my daughter because it looks just like chap stick and my grand daughter has a lot of little friends so the stick is at the dump there for i do not know if it works or not,0
with love by hilary duff this product was delivered promptly and efficiently within three days of ordering it do not like the scent anymore however i do not know if i have changed or if it is an old batch,0
not as my expectation at all i thought it a score book just like the corrs the corrs but i am totally wrong,0
building up steam thefirst volume of gasarakireally surprised me it was well written and thoughtful trying to tell a deep story that was more about behind the scenes power plays than robot brawls this second disc continues to add new wrinkles and complications the war with belgistan comes to a close which surprised me as i thought it was going to run through the entire series and the jssdf forces prepare to pull out we learn about a secret organization calling itself symbol that was assisting belgistan though their motivations for doing so are still clouded yushiro causes some commotion when he heads off base and winds up in the middle of a kidnapping we also see more of the mysterious girl from the first disc that seems to share yushiro powers very little seems to happen episode by episode if the disc is watched straight through it is very satisfying viewing but i can see that if i were watching this half an hour at a time as it was broadcast it would have been tough to follow,1
great classic many unreadable subtitles this film deserves the excellent reputation it has earned however the version i purchased international film series has white subtitles against white backgrounds only about NUMBER are fully readable other releases may have the same problem do not buy this unless you speak french,1
looked cool i am an avid ps NUMBER gamer i purchased this from a local store because of its apparent convenience was i ever wrong the device has a battery indicator on it with NUMBER bars when the batteries go down to NUMBER bars i have a very sporadic connection to my ps NUMBER my ps NUMBER is only NUMBER ft away after a while of playing everquest online this became very annoying and inconvenient after a month i ditched this and bought a cable extender another expensive lesson,0
balls everywhere we live in ak and so we thought we needed to find something to keep our toddler active while being cooped up during the winter our son loves it we hate it it takes up almost the whole living room that not the bad part there is only a bottom in the large section the two medium section are open on the bottom so there are always balls everywhere we bought extra balls which you need but our house turns into a ball pit but we make it a game with our toddler to pick up the balls but warning you will be finding balls for days,0
not just for the over NUMBER crowd santa bought this for my then NUMBER month old for his first christmas he and his little friends just love playing in the tents and tunnells the cats do too i do not think you need to wait for age NUMBER as recommended i do wish it were a bit sturdier as a couple of the ties have torn already i highly recommend this product especially over the winter when it is wet and dreary here it sits in our living room for oodles of fun,1
great product i bought this for my youngest son third birthday it is a great product both of my boys ages NUMBER and NUMBER love to play with it it is a good outside or inside toy but to use it outside there can not be much wind because it is very light and will blow around easily to use inside you do need lots of room it can be put together or taken apart in less than NUMBER minutes so it is a toy you can buy even if you do not have room to always leave it up i would recommend this toy to anyone it would be a great toy for a baby just learning to craw,1
flimsy and seams coming apart i think it is a hit or miss on this product i have a friend that has a playhut and it is fine we just opened ours and at least NUMBER seams are coming undone not sewn correctly there are a couple holes in the material NUMBER forgotten attachment loops and it is rather flimsy kids still like it though it is not going to last too long,0
you call this a mystery i do not get what people like about this book lindsey is a fluid writer good describer but his characters spend way too much time in their own heads and the action in this book at least is predictable and rendered downright boring all the lurid details that are supposed to add to the psychoerotic nature of the book come off as crude and off putting instead like a geek at a sideshow biting the head off a chicken and anyone who can not guess the surprise twist by page NUMBER was not reading very closely,0
disappointed although david lindsey has a talent for descriptive prose this book overall was a big disappointment to me he did not seem to have a clear idea how the plot would unravel and left too many loose ends each time i expected a new wrinkle to develop from a piece of evidence he did not bother to tie it in i think it possible that he did not even know how it would end until it did and at that point he was just tired of writing if you decide to read this book be prepared to see very ugly things with no redeeming human value and be prepared to be left wondering what ever happened with the,0
great for NUMBER month old and NUMBER year old my girls love this it looks great in their little play kitchen and it is educational as well i tried to reduce the poor quality plastic kitchen toys and use good quality products instead the shapes are easy to put together they look realistic,1
lost balls found nice book not quite as good as i expected but had some really awesome photos ac,1
great toy but hard to turn off a review from a kid pro great fun portable con hard to read led except in darkness no off button as soon as i got this toy i started playing it but then i found out that in bright light i could not see the led so i went in some shade now thats just fine except theres no shade indoors so i found a dull light and used it but then i brushed the yesbutton and no button would turn it off so i had to play it though but overall if you have a dull reading light and you are patient buy this product,1
not like the ones i have seen not as good instead of being a better product this one is made cheaper and seems flimsy and does not respond like the older versions are not things supposed to get better this one is made in china where all the leaded paint and computer things are being messed with sabatoged wish i gone into a store and looked at it held it this one is lighter not good quality and the color is dark not the bright red or blue i have always used seen and hard to read the text too would have sent it back but for the shipping costs which ran up the price,0
my kids all their friends love this game my NUMBER NUMBER year olds love this game and we have gotten it for all of their friend birthdays too they love trying to come up with items to stump the computer it keeps them busy and gets them thinking,1
it grrrrreat my wife and son play the game almost everyday after dinner or at breakfast on weekends it fun to think of an object NUMBER q is not very accurate at guessing abstract things and answer it astute questions and it usually gets it right sometimes it has to go on to NUMBER questions though kind of spooky that a decent database and algorithm can fit in such a small device highly recommended,1
classic unadulterated paul kelly the coloured girls this is where it all started for many kelly fans it wonderful stuff paul lyrics on this album are pure working class poetry the musical style is unashamedly lusty boy pub band unsynthesised i remember when music was real and relentlessly cheerful every tune on this album is catchy and even the dark ones are uplifting dumb things was the anthem for pre gen x post baby boom lost souls kelly has honed his lyrical ability since those early days but his story telling has always been strong under the sun is unmistakably australian more so than on later albums this is particularly obvious on forty miles to saturday night and to her door when kelly writes about things australian he gets it right there is emotional truth in the detail here and the music is damn good kelly deserves his status as an australian working class anti hero cb,1
the music on this set is fine as ms day always is however it has a quirk i find distasteful on the third cd is a hidden track track NUMBER to be exact that throws all the songs out of sequence if you rip it i would not recommend buying this for that reason alone all the songs are available on other cd so it no problem skipping over this one it seems if they want to mess with people and keep it a secret until after the money is spent then my money will be spent elsewhere,0
nice instight hidden in the pages the book is not bad the most valuable sections of this book include topics of structure process outcome sometimes cognitive learning values culture goals working with tools and communication the diagrams and tables in this book are almost not helpful at all sometimes you wonder if diagrams like figure NUMBER on page NUMBER is downright necessary to have there i felt like parts four and five of the book really dragged on unnecessarily especially the chapter on organizational engineering it seemed as if the book completely broke down and lost it after page NUMBER i think that hoemann had a lot of potential in this book when i first saw it and i was let down another nice thing would be for him to drop the plethora of coined terms overall there is some really nice thoughts in here but there is a lot of unnecessary things that you have to thumb through,0
too much money for too few channels this antenna may work for some people but for me it was another regrettable purchase the assembly is fairly easy but the results proved a letdown i bought the terk in hopes it would work perfectly with the samsung dtb h NUMBER f set top box i am using to bring in free ota digital and hd stations but i tried two different positions with the terk and its NUMBER db amp was only able to bring in three or four local dt stations at best analog reception proved even worse when i took off the terk and replaced it with a coventionally designed less expensive indoor antenna with a NUMBER db amp in those same positions the difference in performance was amazing i could get between NUMBER and NUMBER dt channels in conclusion my advice is to avoid the hype about unusual antenna design and go for maximum decibel amplification it that extra power that made the difference for me sorry terk,0
best book on vb net i have found this is far and away the best book i have found on vb net it is well written and offers excellent perspective on vb net and net framework with enough detail so that the reader together with some hands on experience will have a good depth of knowledge when he finished highly recommended,1
obfuscation of even the most trivial slices of code bought the book over a month ago and totally disagree with a lot of the reviews online book is almost totally unreadable as it takes even the most simple pieces of code and over complicates them to the point where you just end up closing the cover and say what a waste of money,0
great cookbook i purchased this book for my husband who worked for a couple of weeks in trinidad he was not able to buy a cookbook while there i searched amazon and bought the one and only trindad cookbook and it was a winner he was very pleased that the recipes were for a lot of the food that he experienced,1
one of the best books of all time this book is an amazing story of a young girl growing up in poverty in new york city the vividness of the images the developing of the characters betty smith is a master at her art francie and her family come alive in this book i have read it over and over and i still love it i would recommend it for anyone from high level NUMBER th grade readers to elderly people what an amazing story,1

three thumbs up i give this book three thumbs up it is poinent funny sad romantic and scary all at the same time it is a classic that will keep readers on their toes for a million years,1
fantastic reading i have read a tree grows in brooklyn over and over again when things in my own life seem too difficult i read about the life of francie nolan and realize i can overcome any problem with the same determination that francie and her family had all the characters were good from the strong willed mother the weak dreamer of a father to the loving but promiscuous aunt francie was my favorite character of all she was able to overcome the adversity in her life through sheer dtermination and the gift of learning she learned from everyone around her and the harsh enviroment in which she lived i would recommend this book anyone who likes coming of age stories i have read a tree growsi have read a tree growsi have read a tree growsin,1
it not hype this book has so many pearls of wisdom it very simply written so do not expect this to be a typical nyt bestseller like the one you read last week i believe this book was written in the NUMBER s and although much of the vernacular in the book is obviously of a different period in time it has a timeless and universal appeal i have not even finished it yet but have already decided enough with the library version i want my own copy so that i can use the advice it offers later on in life do not miss this one and make sure you tell your friends about it so that they can come and thank you later and you can say i told you so,1
a diseased tree grows in brooklyn i recently read this book for my english class at school i have enjoyed every other book we have been required to read however i strongly disliked this book from the first chapter i lost interest in the ornate seemingly endless details on several occasions i noted incorrect grammar in the book and even misspellings never before have i seen such a poorly written book i do not recommend this book i would not call this book a classic,0
saw the movie many years ago loved it then and loved the story as i read it times were tough by our standards but attitudes were good and mostly positive good read,1
a classic i honestly do not know how this novel has become a classic as an avid reader i had to practically force myself to get through this book and only did so because my book club was reading it i was not the only person in our club who was disappointed it was a miserable story and pointless it was a great discription of life in brooklyn during that time period but betty smith never made me care about the characters enough to care about what happened to them this novel needs more character development to be a classic i only give it NUMBER stars instead of NUMBER because it really is a great description of life in brooklyn,0
a lifetime favorite my mom gave me this book to read when i was very young actually i have one of the first publications of it i have read this book a number of times over the years and never get tired of the characters and the story reminds us that recycling actually did begin a long time ago when during the depression kids would take wagons full of things to recycle to get pennies for bread a beautiful story i will read again and again so happy to have it on my kindle now,1
great book good condition loved the book read it in NUMBER days the condition was as advertised by the seller would recommend it to other people,1
credit cards will not fit all the credit card slots are to small for credit cards i had to cut each side of the slots to get the cards to fit,0
it both gorgeous and a good read this has been my favorite book now for a couple of months and i finally had to write a review that disagrees with the previous negative ones there no nice way to say this but maybe there is a new money old money difference in perception here what i see in the book is one gorgeous and highly livable room after another lively vibrant personal and comfortable homes obviously used by real people what i did not expect was that i would pick up as many decorating ideas for my own home as i did,1
dissappointing at best the book does not live up to traditional home reputation of quality work frankly i can find better photos and design insite from magazines than what i found in this book it easy to understand why there are so many people wanting to sell the copies they have it is honestly a disppointment if you are used to truly inspiring design publications if you decide to buy this book do yourself a favor and purchase a used copy even at amazon reduced price it still over priced for what you get,0
a story everyone must know secret of the wild child tells the compelling story of susan wiley a young girl who was rescued from a dysfunctional home during the NUMBER s by a system that ultimately failed her nova explores her journey from hell to limbo in an unforgettable documentary that shows the darkest sides of humanity and the captivating innocence of a child you too will be haunted by this beautiful girl whom everybody simply referred to as genie i would so love to own a copy of this dvd,1
well worth acquiring pianist john hicks has long been a master of the modern mainstream without necessarily blazing any new paths of his own on this cd he is featured on a pair of solo numbers a duet with flutist elise wood a sensitive version of duke ellington star crossed lovers a trio rendition with bassist curtis lundy and drummer cecil brooks iii of mood swings with a quintet a blazing version of my shining hour that has both bobby watson and vincent herring on altos and five selections with the full sextet four standards follow six obscurities including charles mingus diane hicks who often shows off the influence of mccoy tyner voicings has never recorded an uninspired record and this one is better than average for him due to the variety of moods instrumental colors and settings the music is continually interesting and well worth acquiring,1
conversation video i bought this video for the conversation video where waylon jennings and hank williams jr are playing their guitars singing and sharing whisky i like when they raise their whisky glasses to each other this is a comical well put together video with robert duvall i like the NUMBER videos that tied together like a mini movie every walon jennings fan should own this great video,1
not what i expected i looked forward to this celebration cd very eagerly however the disappointment was great other than gretchen davis i have been a fan of kristofferson for NUMBER years and that could be the problem there are very few people who can sing his songs johnny waylon willie and kris i far preferred and really love the this old road cd donna,0
how did brian mcknight and russell crowe get on this cd i could not wait to hear this cd cause i love kris kristofferson and his work many of the names on the cd were great and some great singers came out to do tributes to kristofferson shooter jenning silver tongue devil and i is amazing willie nelson the legend is as great or if not better then the highwaymen version the version on why me is also a worthy tribute the problem i had with the cd was when i heard russell crowe darby castle cause it was a horrible redition where russell crowe tries and fails at doing the talking blues that was done so well by kristofferson and dylan then i heard the awful brian mcknight atrocity me and bobby magee which was just mcknight turning a country and rock classic into his horrible r b redition i had never heard a bad version of me and bobby magee until this cd i do not know how those two got on this cd but fans of kristofferson should be enraged,0
hooray for doris these two albums have been thankfully put on one cd doris is at her best here particularly with sassy renditions of cheek to cheek and easy to love the title song with its slow beginning to its jazzy ending is sung by doris in an ironic and humorous manner even the composer admits that her rendition of horray for hollywood is the best version by any singer on volume NUMBER she sings wistfully of it might as well be spring and three coins in the fountain as well sings coyly nice work if you can get it and i have got my love to keep me warm also over the rainbow and blues in the night are stand outs,1
strangely compelling but not really all that great i gave this book two stars because of its original approach to an old idea the zombies in this book called bodies the z word is never used were different enough to draw my attention unfortunately that is really all this book had going for it the author failed to show me any reason to be afraid of these bodies i was told over and over that the survivors were afraid but i saw no compelling reason for that if you do decide to try this book because of all the wtf NUMBER reviews everywhere i recommend you a get it from the library and b stop at book one,0
save your money do not buy this dryer i bought this dryer on october NUMBER received it on october NUMBER and on november NUMBER the plug started to overheat and burn after NUMBER minutes of use the settings at which the plug started to smoke were medium speed and hot temperature also i did not use it daily as you can see nothing too harsh or unexpected for a hair dryer i am returning it to amazon asap and hope i can get my money back i do not want a replacement one bad experience is enough for me just as a hint if you are thinking of buying a vidal sassoon dryer if their products have so many negative reviews and unsatisfied costumers it is not a coincidence obviously the vidal sasson brand has serious quality management issues i thought about this but went an bought this dryer any way i was a sucker for the price and free shipping i should have just gone with my initial mistrust and bought something else i hope this does not happen to you,0
really good miniseries but amazon let me down i bought this from amazon in july unfortunately i only opened it last week to find out it was a defective on the first disk it played the first and third episodes perfectly but the second episode had NUMBER minutes of skipping amazon has absolutely no way of reporting this after your window of return has expired so buyer beware if you are slow to view your dvd you can be screwed i have always had good luck with amazon until now the series is excellent and quite intriguing until the end i enjoyed it despite the skipping in the middle,1
a necessary if unpleasant reading experience rating this one is difficult the rich symbolism of tarot was forever impacted by the order of the golden dawn and a e waite pictorial key is a glimpse into that symbolism readers with a serious interest in occult tarot will find this an essential text waite though considered himself bound by vows of secrecy and mixes misinformation and blinds in his work to lead the uninitiated astray so reading critically is a must to make matters worse his prose style is ponderous and leaden deliberately overcomplicated and abstruse less animated than al gore however modern tarot decks borrow and adapt from the waite smith deck design to understand the symbolism that underlies almost every deck on the market today frequently symbolism the deck designers had no awareness of this book is absolutely necessary it will not be a fun read but it is necessary,1
excelent this is the second time i bought the same book from stamatis the first one i gave to one friend he push me do give it as a gift this second edition is far better,1
every since i saw one on tv every since i have seen on on tv i been scared it sounds wierd too i do not like the music maker get an idog,0
good system i have used the voice alert system for about a month now it works good but does false trigger some i have tried moving the sensor and adjusting the sensivitity and it has helped i may just need to tweak it a little more it has never failed to trigger when someone has entered the area which is the important part i do not know that i would hook it to a siren but i am very happy with the system instructions that come with the unit are very good but where a little unclear about how to hook up the external devices to be trigged i plan to add a light to be activialed in the warehouse for night i did buy an extra sensor for the driveway and some of the false alerts there are casued by birds flying in front of the sensor it a good NUMBER away and the base unit is inside a brick building in an interior room NUMBER walls it picks up all traffic in the drive good system for the money,1
voice alert system NUMBER i am sorry that i ever bought this thing it is the most annoying toy i have ever bought no matter where i put it or how i adjust it it goes off all night long this would be a great gadget in theory if we lived in an animal free no squirrels and bug free no flying beetles moths etc world but seeing how that is not the case it really not good for anyone even the shadows of people and cars set this thing off i thank god that i did not buy two alert systems as i originally planned,0
great puzzle although it took a long time to receive this puzzle it was worth the wait my kids love trying to figure out how to maneuver the vehicles to get them to a building i would recommend this for children over NUMBER it takes a lot of fine motor coordination to move the vehicles,1
too much sex have read all the books published to date loved the plots and story lines finally through them all out yep tossed one paperback and two hardcopy as i realized as i was re reading them that the somewhat graphic sex dominance and submission and harem girls etc did not really add to the story but sure promoted things i just do not like the march upcountry series with david weber had boys and girls and talked about sex but was what i consider more normal for scifi and was not graphic did not promote alternative sex so while i enjoy the james bond nature of the novels i really can not recommend them to any of my friends and would not recommend them to anyone younger,0
first prize this book has found a permanent spot in my home namely on my desk where i do all my hobbies it has loads of great ideas that i have already used can not wait for the author next book apparantly its a sourcebook on animal designs,1
do not buy this item did not work and it just irritates your skin you think it works because you see your skin being irritated and think that it the product doing its job but it does not work not only was this way more expensive than the other corn sticks but it also was a waste of my money,0
a total rip if you own music has the right to children if you already own music has the right to children and you are itching for more boc like i was then just take a deep breath and be content with music becasue this cd is a money making scheme just about all the songs on it are the same ones there is no re mixing at all but there is one exception at the end they play a NUMBER minute bit that gets you excited but then ends this is hardly worth NUMBER NUMBER so looks like you and me are going to have to wait until boc makes a new album awwwwwwwww hurry up guys,0
violence bonjour how many graphically described violently mutilated corpses do they think it takes to sell a book having rather enjoyed deja dead the genre of lady pathologists seems to be the flavour of the month i just could not finish death du jour i found it a rehash of the other with more blood and gore added and even some sex wowee it made me long for a good old romantic historical novel where have they gone,0
watch out for those bones forensic pathologist temp brennan spends part of each year in north carolina and part of it in quebec investigating death usually her investigations find her examining bodies and bones of historical deaths or of recent deaths where normal means of pathological investigation are not effective author kathy reichs clearly knows her pathology herself a practitioner she makes her field exciting for the reader to learn about in addition her character temp brennan finds herself in the midst of people who deaths have been quite mysterious death du jour travels from uncovering the hundred year old remains of a nun who is believed to be a saint to the sleaziness of a cult who might just be killing people as part of their worship temp brennan is not just a laboratory investigator she is indeed one solid pathologist who is not particularly willing to let a case close without getting to the bottom of it a fascinating world and a well told mystery,1
dull flat writing kills the fun gore yes lots of information about autopsies and assorted other matters rather too clearly fictitious characters it all adds up to a rather flat dispiriting formula effort if you just have to know who responsible every time you read of a fictitious killing then you will get through this otherwise it becomes rather a drag,0
awful this book was boring and poorly written the plot was weak and obvious but worse than that the writing was simplistic and choppy very hard to read i always finish books that i start and this one i almost put down i only finished it by skimming because the reading was so choppy because i had already bought it and could not return it no character development no characterization of the characters at all and the dialogue is flat and boring and only serves to advance plot descriptions do not describe they tell in short sentances or they lecture i am a scientist and i found this book boring and annoying this is my second reichs novel the other was better but i will not be coming back save your money and your time,0
what is your definition of good readable and missing no pages wow i was in the book business a long time and this paperback i received was not in good condition it was dog eared had water damage and cover damage good thing it was only a paperback and quite cheap paperbacks were essentially intended to be like the newspaper read and discarded this one perhaps not discard in this day and age but definitely not resold like i said good thing a paperback and my author du jour because otherwise i would have been p however it did arrive in record time NUMBER days i think,0
good but i really liked this book and i love the main character of tempe brennan the characters are well drawn and multi dimensional and i loved all of the tidbits about forensics and anthropology the locations were rich in detail and i felt like i was there my only complaint about this book was that i had every single plot point figured out a good NUMBER pages before tempe did there was not a single thing in this book that surprised me but it was still an enjoyable read and even if i knew that going in i would still read it,1
holy grail found i have been after the vinyl for these two albums for NUMBER years it is considered the holy grail of west coast usa psychedelia i gave up and bought the cds through amazon better than i thought an absolute classic and equal to the reputation years ahead of its time but yet perfect for the summer of love generation everyone i have played it to are equally high in praise,1
too much is not enough my boys ages NUMBER and NUMBER can not get their fill of this colorful wacky book the love indulging their imaginations with it each night before bed and sweet thirds and fourths of it in a single sitting would not be enough if they had their way,1
a good collection i always liked this release for the following tracks ghosts of cape horn and make way for the lady the others are fine too with the sole clunker being the wretched the auctioneer which is so out of place here if i want to hear that nonsense i will go to a cattle auction originally a digital recording it suffered from tape hiss which is odd for digital the early days of recording the hiss is gone but the recording still does not sound right to my ears particularly the vocals suprisingly this is a very short disc clocking in at a paltry NUMBER NUMBER another entire release could have easiliy fit on the remainder of the disc i hate when labels cheat the consumer in that fashion so be it still worthwhile for some very good tracks NUMBER tracks full lyrics NUMBER NUMBER,1
dreaming of more gordon did not have a experience while recording this one yet it classic lightfoot dream street should have been one of his biggest sellers,1
vivid descriptions and fast moving plot although it has been some time since i read this story its vivid descriptions have stayed with me the author does a marvelous job of describing the southern california beach city setting so much so that while driving on sepulvida two months ago i saw a drab three story stucco commercial building and simply knew that it must be the building that houses the call center also typically southern californian the car chase contained endless minutes at a jam packed intersection with the driver cursing himself for chosing the wrong route overall hotline is an entertaining story that keeps the pages turning,1
terrible i have never entered a review before but this book was so bad i had to stop you from wasting your time i tried to enter a NUMBER rating but i guess NUMBER star is as low as you can go the reviews were mixed but i bought this book anyway because i run a call center and i thought perhaps that would make it more interesting for me total waste of time can not believe that the type a in me would not just let me quit half way through i kept thinking the real storyline was yet to be introduced or maybe some interesting plot twist was coming boring characters unrealistic scenarios i will never read another book by this author,0
the book is an excellent ending or is it this book is ultra rare so if you can get a copy keep it i stole mine from the public library the book visits some of the old spacer worlds from the robot novels and it is interesting to see how time has treated them this book also provides incite into the whole foundation series this is a must,1
too much this book has too much of everything except action there is not much of a story and it way too long there a lot of endless talk about the same subjectsand lots more sex than any other asimov book theother foundation books were fine for all ages this onehas way too much adult content i think that NUMBER pagescould easily have been cut out in fact to get to thereal story just skip to the last NUMBER pages boring long it dishonors the enitre series,0
asimov is a genius anyone who has not read about hari seldon and psychohistory needs to though it a fictional science in the book i would not be suprised if someone was not studying it today asimov writing is compelling not too full of sci fi babble which often sounds odd to readers NUMBER years later and that makes it pretty timeless many older books constantly irritate me in this manner,1
another one of those bands whose latest work disappoints me if like me you were expecting more about tomorrow then steer clear this just was not ahem enough for my tastes and felt like a real step backwards contrary to the other reviews i do not think they will return to their higher energy material which for me is a shame as i was a fan,0
one of the greatest tpb of all time if you like comic book deities even a slight bit or even modern or ancient human deities then this book is for you struggles are all of cosmic proportion i love the reference to all earth ancient religion gods as gods who are but a drop in the bucket compared to some of the forces at work here even though its a comic book it tells it like it is us as human beings can lay no claim to even comprehend the magnitude and sheer myriad of benevolent and malevolent forces that constantly struggle on planes of existence much higher than ours or any of our perceived gods religious zealots would do good to read this book and give them a better understanding of how small their religious texts are in the grand scheme of things,1
great story i am enjoying it i have always been intriqued with guys like thanos apocalypse galactus and so on these is a great story about the mad power hungry thanos and the super heroes who have to stop him i learn alot of things i did not know of thanos i have yet to finish reading the book i am halfway there but i have to say i have loved it i am not that big of a comics collector but i decided to buy this and i must say its a great read,1
this deserves to be an animated movie i had already read this story before i got the compilation version thanos is by far one of the best villians i have ever read about he appears to be a villian but from his point of view he does not really see a good or bad in anything the action is great and does make sense in the marvel universe this story is meant for animation and would easily be on a higher level then the previous cartoon movies that have been released the story of thanos getting the infinity gems is just as much fun as seeing him use them to mess with everyone including the cosmic beings,1
a collector review an awesome book because it is full of many heroes and many villians in the marvel universe,1
a patchwork not a book the authors have taken the opportunity to publish a book of which they wrote only a small portion the plot progresses through the snippets of first time writers this book is not a part of the series but an attempt to milk the series for all it worth see also grantville gazette i ii iii instead of a cogent style the book is pieced together from snippets available elsewhere as a result the book fails to tell a cogent story forcing the reader to parse disparate language and editorial differences from section to section,0
worst in the series thus far by far this is the worst book in the series maybe five pages worth of rebellion or plot development NUMBER pages of dry political education and NUMBER pages on ballet recitals dry and pointless reading,0
disappointing after the really great work in NUMBER and NUMBER i discovered eric flint work when a friend loaned me NUMBER i had not read much speculative fiction other than some harry turtledove and i have to say i loved it then i went out and bought NUMBER it was another gem things skipped a bit with the galileo affair just a little too much sermonizing but this latest the ram rebellion just stinks most of the stories were written by obvious amateurs fascinated with sheep cooking agriculture and whatnot now those are all fine things but i bought the other books to be entertained with action fantasy history in that order not history agribusiness feminism i am going to read one more book in this series and if it does not improve i will swear it off for good,0
not so much i was very disappointed with this ring i plan on returning it looks nothing like the picture i would have been better off buying something similar at the teen jewelry store at the local mall totally over priced not worth it at all,0
i agree just recieved today this ring looks nothing like the picture the diamonds are small and not very noticeable i will be sending this back,0
sterling silver cubic zirconia eternity ring i was looking for a small silver ring and this one was perfect it exceeded my expections because the ring was not expensive at all it is true to size and if you want a ring that sparkles quite a bit this one is it mrs mayville,1
i love this simple band i wanted a pretty band with sparkle cause i hate to have a raised up stone with little ones for the scratching but this ring is perfect smooth and shiny,1
decent after having a lot of trouble finding a wedding band for my small ring finger i decided on this one this is the NUMBER th ring i have tried it fits nicely and looks fine with my small diamond solitaire has a good amount of sparkle but definitely does not look expensive do not let anyone look too closely,1
back to the movies this product was handled and packaged fast easy to open was very happy to fined this old movie to enjoy over and over again,1
worthless this stuff is a ripoff i found some at a local store and bought it just to see if it amounted to anything it does not go to the store and buy a NUMBER oz bottle of cheap body wash and a NUMBER oz vial of tea tree oil empty NUMBER oz from body wash and then pour tea tree oil in shake well same thing only much stronger and a fraction of the cost,0
dangerous be prudent it is a dangerous concoction the fumes can give a soar throat swollen glands and you might not get the smell out of your nose for a few days it needs warning labels and testing,0
disappointed i developed white spots on my legs after using a tanning bed this product had great reviews eliminating the appearance of these white spots unfortunately it did nothing for me,0
starblazers goood i just picked up the dvd of the first NUMBER episodes and must say that the vhs version by jupiter was much smoother and cleaner than this dvd version however this is better than nothing as stated by others and my wife who has been a fan for nigh on NUMBER years now so if you must have your starblazers as my wife does then definitely pick this up and send in your cards,1
america is going deaf i find it very hard to understand how anyone could listen to this music as a vivd music listener and an open minded one at that this music was the most horrid bit of sound i have ever heard people need to stop and remember what real talent is not this uncoordinated bad singing group their music is as is they are making up the guitar riffs as they go and i do not find it difficult to scream so glassjaw if your ever in need of a new screamer i am your man,0
the worst band ever i have seen this band NUMBER times and believe me both times i wish they wernt on the bill they are by far the worst band ever and if you like them you should be kicked in the head until theres nothing left of you seeing them live is like being kicked in the head anyway,0
it definately grows on you at first listen i was only impressed by cosmopolitan blood loss but after listening to the whole cd a few times in my friends car i realized that this album had a lot more depth than i gave it credit for in my opinion some of the stand out songs on this record are ape dos mil and cosmo blood loss but each song has something to offer you are not just going to get an annoying flow of screams throughout each song there a nice variance between the deep screaming and the switch to passionate singing which makes each song stand out i would definately grab this album if you are fans of finch and the used its worth your time,1
beyond excellent i seldom ever find a book in my school library that is worth reading this book was impossible to put down and kept me going back for more i am hoping the door is open for a sequel which i buy right away,1
the transall saga the transall sagaby george mickcloudmark is a normal teenager who lives to be out in the wilderness mark goes on a solo camping trip through the desert when finds a strange blue light that when he touched it it transported him to another planet and time now he must us every nature skill he ever learned to survive two years past and is now a strong dark colored man one day he fined s a village under attack by an evil ruler he joins the fight and saves the king of the village and is made second in command for his bravery he is now part of this village and is starting to think that he wants to give up looking for the blue light a stay with his new family but some people do not like mark and want him to leave mark now has a price on his head for his death mark and his new family will fight for his freedom or die trying will mark survive the war to go on to find the light or die defending his new life and family,0
a book i actually wanted to read this is a great book about a thirteen year old boy named mark mark is hiking across the desert where he stumbles upon a mysterious light as mark touches it he ends up in a whole new world grass and plants are red and animals are different also there are new types of humans now mark must use everything he knows to survive and to find the mysterious light to get back home this book has a lot of action in it and it keeps you wandering the whole time that is one of the reasons i like this book the only thing i did not like is the book just kind of stops at the end it is a great book though i can compare this book to a lot of books will hobbs writes because they both have a lot of action i could also compare this book to any survival books because mark has to survive i would recommend this book to anyone who likes will hobbs or loves action and adventure,1
a great book i was assigned to review this book in class for my literature final i am not a big reader so i was upset about haveing to read the day after i got the book i got sick and had to stay home from school to pass the time i sat out in the sun and read the whole book in two hours this book was exciting and although it was slow at first when the story got going i could not stop reading the key character is mark a young boy who is into hiking his parents let him go on a hike in a desert and he promises to meet them at the other end of the desert while mark is setting up camp one night he sees a wierd blue light he climes closer to it and falls into it when mark wakes up he is in a red jungle he goes through a sieries of troubles such as quick sand and finding food before he finds other humans mark finds some great compainions and a great adventure,1
james lee burke dave robichaeux series this is a blanket review of all NUMBER books in this series the first being the neon rain jlb is the definitive of mystery crime writers when he developed the character dave robichaeux a cajun homicide detective who started his career in new orleans and eventually semi retired in new iberia la the stories are strong sensitive moral and above that hypnotic in a sense where you are in the story literally if your hooked on it highly recommended along with his other series of books,1
not worth the price i expected this to be a large book like the other good old days books that i bought it is only NUMBER pages i do not blame the seller i was stupid for not checking it out before i bought it,0
robin trower putting it straight NUMBER polydor recordssongs include life in londongettin bettarunnin from the futureit ai not what it seemsoff beat ridelovin youdedicationspeakeasy,1
brings out the romantic in me these are the romantic songs i grew up with and that is why i bought this cd if you need a shot in the romance department one or more of these songs should do it,1
my new favorite face wash the title says it all this is hands down the best face wash i have ever encountered light mildly fragrant and deep cleansing it leaves your skin feeling smooth and moisturized,1
great whodunnit a classic mystery with plot twists throughout to keep you guessing watch for a spell binding cameo by stephen herbster virtually buried in the credits but more than worthy of praise,1
sloppy research although desjardins book contains a number of interesting revelations his arguments are often compromised by sloppy research for example his key claim that little round top was not known by that name until years after the battle was proven false nearly a decade ago desjardin is especially weak when he tries to play photo detective he mentions with praise the research of photo historian william frassanito but does not seem to have actually read frassanito books very carefully desjardin arguments also suffer from the obvious omission of pertinent but contrary information,0
love it she wonderful t one of the best books i have ever read was forced to read it for school so my expektations were the lowest ever she a very strong women and i like the way she gets what she wants she not afraid to make a sacrifice or two to have things her way though i do not like the way she abandonnes her children all the time,1
love these diapers they do not leak okay the title says it all these diapers just do not leak for larger babies i love them and use them exclusively for our child at night he trained during the day and have no problems whatsoever they are a snap to put on and just are wonderful to use i can not recommend these enough i have tried so many brands and these definitely work the best i have broken too many fingernails changing crib sheets from the results of cheap leaky diapers and so therefore i highly recommend these diapers and so do my nails,1
why do writers do this this is an okay book in terms of the man life most info is culled from other sources but when it comes to denzel washington career the author commits an unpardonable sin he writes way too much about each individual film the actor made up to the time of the book publication and then gives away the ending to each and every one of them unacceptable,0
this book is wild wonderful blatantly honest and necessary if i were stranded on a deserted island and could have one book with me i would choose this one it angers me saddens me offends me and elates me but most of all it inspires me each time i read it i uncover something precious and unique it never grows old if you truly love all that is convenient and commercialized if you revel in the gifts technology brings you do not read it it too good for you if you truly love and are capable of appreciating the serene beauty of the wilderness buy it read it then cry for it all gone when you read read beneath the text read deeply into the subtext of this book it all about surfaces abbey proves that we can not truly see experience or appreciate anything unless we can look below the surface as he did,1
buy this book if you love nature mr abbey has filled this book with many thoughtful observations of the desert and life in general this book should be mandatory reading for any present day backpacker or outdoorsman,1
sums up my innermost feelings i can not rave about this book enough it was required reading for a literature of the outdoors class i took in college a decade ago and i have probably read it NUMBER times since then my copy is tattered highlighted and written all over growing up in rural utah i feel abbey pain towards the paving and developing of these beautiful areas i crave the solitude that he writes about understand the attachment towards random small creatures and can not help but laugh and nod my head in agreement at his rants anyone who spends time in pristine wilderness redrock desert or not will appreciate this read,1
nice for what it is an inexpensive tp holder it performs great have had other brands and it is built as good as any,1
bring the old type back at least with the old type you could hook a water hose to the outlet side and attach a sprinkler to it and not have to drag a hose up and down your garden roes knocking plants,0
i have three of these things none of which work i am an old lady who does not throw anything away thinking i might need it some day over the years i have purchased three of stern sprayers with high hopes that the newest one will finally work forget it i am finally dumping my hope and throwing them out it hard to believe that a functional one has not been designed,0
lazy reproduction of an old book maybe this book is out of copyright or something but this printing is a grossly lazy reproduction of the original printing it actually a copy of the pages not even fit right to the book size they did not bother to transcribe and properly typeset the text using a modern system so you are basically paying for a very rough poorly scaled photocopy of the old printing no wonder it not available on kindle,0
an elric novel written by authors who grew up reading elric i have read every elric novel i own NUMBER kilos of fantasy paperbacks this book brought me as much joy inspiration and satisfaction as any book i have ever read elric was the first evil hero every fantasy writer has taken a peice of elric to produce their characters drizt is a shadow of elric raistlen is almost an exact copy of elric darth vader sinister life dependence on technology sorcery and eventual noble self sacrifice are in mimicry of elric in this book so many authors who wanted to write elric stories some who had made great fame and fortune copying moorcock were given licence to write as they pleased every short story in the book is its authors best work because as they write about their own dark heros in their own novels they are thinking about elric my highest praise i want a sequel or two or ten a series published monthly untill i am old and grey,1
fantastic pix of texas beautiful pictures excellent photographs if you want ton see texas this book is it,1
pure dissappointment i am sorry but this album was not what i was hoping it would be i purchased it as a child and own it now as an adult however the only reason i do own it was because they attached their videos on dvd we like it wild loose and juicy gothca krazy are great songs but only in there video forms if you are looking for those sames songs as released on video on cd you are not going to find it sad to say but i feel the only reason this album really sold was because many saw the videos first and then purchased the album hoping to hear the same thing,0
trouble we have trouble with the electric anchor the cord tends to backlash and ties itself all around the wheel so far it has been a battle nothing like we expected if i could i would return it great idea not such a great thing,0
i am with jim the pedals fell off the seats broke off the bikes looked great and we we are psyched about them easy to put together nice fat tires for our play yard but in a matter of weeks they were unuseable and off to the bike repair shop not a good deal at all,0
boring the problem with this book is that you can not argue for copyrights on one hand and against them on the other either there is intellectual property or there is not if there is not then it is a government granted monopoly and government granted monopolies can be shown to be less efficient then the market as such this means that copyrights would not do a better job at encouraging ingenuity the thing is the book seems to talk about the philosophy of it a lot more then the reality of it,0
the most beautifuly written illustrated book on unicorns this is with out a doubt the most beatifuly written illustrated book on unicorns ever published every page is a visual mystical treasure i reccomend it to any all seekers of light on the subject of unicorns,1
relieved the fifth season was finally released i had bought all the dvds up to season NUMBER and was dissapointed that they stopped issuing the seasons all in al the features are the same as the other seasons and the dvd are a must have for any fresh prince fan,1
hilarious i absolutely love the fresh prince and buying this season was a great investment i personally think season NUMBER is the best but this one is a close second also season NUMBER has bloopers at the end of every episode that i love but i do not believe any of the others do which is a little disappointing regardless i will be buying season NUMBER soon,1
picture looks much better than product if i had opened the box before i gave the club champ putt return putting mat as a gift i would have returned it disappointed in the quality and durabiity would not recommend,0
an easy read it implementing the guidelines that tough clear simple easy to read style many of the steps are obvious in retrospect the book merely raises your awareness of the steps so you are more likely to use them,1
disappointed although the subject matter was interesting the lack of pictures and overall layout of the book made it tedious to read i saw so many opportunities for this book to be better for example there were many instances where an accompanying picture would have clarified a description or put it into a better context a specific example of this is where she mentions a nail belt it would have been illuminating to see a picture of one on that page the writing style to me seemed dry almost textbook,0
disappointing this is a fascinating subject but kuhns makes too many mistakes in areas i am familiar with for me to trust there are none in areas i am not her discussion of pagan culture is muddled she collapses together customs of different centuries as if all pagans of all places and times were interchangeable the book also shows signs of having been spell checked by computer,0
very nice set especially for the money bought this to replace a very expensive crystal set i given away and like it a lot for the money it pretty and functional comes nicely packaged too would not hesitate to give as a gift,1
clear and tremendously helpful i have been studying arabic from a variety of sources and this book has clarified much of the grammar i was confused about i would not recommend it for beginners but for those who need to clarify arabic overwhelming grammar rules and review and organize what you may have learned in your courses it tremendously helpful its layout is simple and straightforward and the exercises are helpful too,1
what a stinker how did this piece of junk ever get made granted i am not a teenager but i hope that even teenagers have brains enough to recognize a dog when they see one the only reason i viewed this film is because of the previews they were pretty comical but three or four scenes do not make a movie what wrong with screen writers these days whoever wrote this must have been related to some one in upper management otherwise it would have never been produced the writer should have smoked the script it would have saved us all some money,0
dude whens it over this movie starts out funny but towards the movie the storyline gets pretty old its definitaly not a classic or a good movie and its super boring and not funny my favorite part was when it was over,0
i wish i could give it NUMBER stars because i am cool what a hot film so intelligent so provocative buy it now,1
dude where my car fox has provided dude where my car with a great dvd package that consists of excellent picture and sound quality along with a handful of cool extras that are sure to please fans for those who have never seen the film i recommend a rental if you are a fan of stupid comedies as it is a fairly funny and entertaining flick NUMBER stars,0
pointless this movie was just dumb but some parts were funny that why it got NUMBER stars it seems like the move was trying too hard to be the next bill ted but you know that not going to happen,0
rent before you buy i was very dissapointed by this movie it did not do well at the box office and everyone else i know who saw it did not like this movie the story and all the characters are quite stupid everyone has a different sense of humor so i will not tell you what is and is not funny but due to popular opinion you may want to borrow or rent this movie if you intend to buy it i am not in the bussiness of giving poor ratings but i hope i can save you a few bucks,0
it is dumb i borrowed this movie from my brother thank goodness i did not pay anything even to rent it and found it to be quite stupid i love movies like ace ventura dumb dumber and bill ted and this is no where close to any of these contrary to other reviews the only funny parts i found were the tatto scene saw it NUMBER times in the commercials but still laughed at it when he draws it out suuuuuweeeet what does mine say and the bubble wrap parts the chinese restaurant scene was so not funny it actually made me mad it gets two stars from me because i saw it for free after a long day with a sick child where i jsut wanted to get away from reality for a hour or two it did accomplish that but only minimally,0
dude sweet this movie is sooo funny it about these NUMBER party dudes trying to find their car in order to get their girlfriend anniversery gifts in order to recieve treats but along the way things do not go as planed it a comedy starring ashton kutcher and sean scott you have to see it,1
ehhhhh i was reeeeally excited when i received my copy of this album i took it to my car and started listening with the system blasting i found myself pressing next track more than loving the music it definitely unique some of the songs are reeeally good but the rest make up for it ugglor mossen might be one of the best songs i have ever heard the rest of the cd can not compete though the reason this album earned NUMBER stars is because this song is on it i have reviewed a number of cds and box sets if it great goa you are looking for you get you movin and groovin go other places it may be a great album for some of you looking for a unique sound that unmatchable like i thought it would be but i can not say i am satisfied,0
trinity this was not what i was expecting it was not as funny as any of the westerns nobody is my name for example very disappointed not with deliver or anything just the content of the video itself,0
newspapers are still a rag infamous scribblers was a fantastic read newspapers have not changed much since colonial times the best part of the book was the historical facts brought up and the infighting of politicians and printers among themselves and with each other it brought out things about our founding fathers that are not in your regular history books there is a very great likeness of events and people then and now the one big difference today is newspapers do not attack like they did then they did not hold back much at all and would keep it up and not backdown give it a try i think you will enjoy it ken,1
very fun racing game roadsters is one of those games that plays like an arcade racer but has real licensed cars both the graphics and the play control are very good and the cars are definetly cool my only complaint was that there wasnt enough tracks there are only NUMBER of them and after a while you just want more,1
autumn the city zombie extravaganza this book was a great follow up to david moody first book in his autumn series the virus that has taken over the world has hit the city plenty of new characters and twists and turns even though most zombie books are predictable david moody gives an exciting and new experience for zombie lovers you almost feel like you are there this book is hard to put down when you get to the last NUMBER pages you just want it to go on and on and on shame that david autumn series is not able to be purchased at book stores in australia though which means you have to pay a lot of money for one book but the books are totally worth it i love the autumn series and can not wait to purchase the next books in his autumn series,1
not first printing i bought this book thinking it was an adition to the autumn book line it says first printing i guess i need to pay closer attention because it is a reprint of the first book by a new publisher ripped off i will not buy anything by this publisher again,0
the worst book i have ever finished i can not believe people really enjoyed this book it was tedious and dull nothing new happened once the stage was set of all the zombie reanimated body books and movies this has to take the cake as the worst bar none no character development at all nothing to make you care about any of the characters no explanation or even conjecture about what the f has taken place just rotting flesh and shuffling bodies,0
i am now avoiding moen faucets we had a moen kitchen faucet with a lifetime warranty it is junk it started dripping after NUMBER years and the exterior actually started rusting when i tried to replace the cartridge the screw was so cheap the head partly disintigrated and required an extractor i could go on do not be fooled into thinking you are getting quality when they advertise lifetime warranty in fairness they sent a new cartridge but what i want is quality in the first place it will last a lifetime as long as you do not live more than five years,0
if things were perfect this album would be among them moby is more than a genius of techno he is a genius of music what he does in this album is so joyful and depressing simultaneously i just want to listen to it over and over again the best tracks are porcelain why does my heart feel so bad southside natural blues and run on and the rest are still amazing songs,1
a masterpiece of electronic music this is truly a electronic masterpiece and will never been forgotten i have been a big fan of moby for quite some time now but i have found myself skipping a song here or their on some of his other albums this cd is one of those cd you want to leave on repeat all day and listen to it through and through on this album moby remixes a lot of old blues songs and briliantly brings them to life he takes electronic music to a whole new level with this album if you do not own any moby start here and if you love the smash hit porcelain or everloving you will want to check out his album i like to score as another great moby cd to own if you have not started listening to electronic music at all start here,1
excellent moby latest album touches on many genres of music and it sounds fantasctic instantly recognisable tunes hit you and no wonder companies are queueing up to have his music play on their adverts one of the best things about play is the number of songs on the album a massive NUMBER it is guarenteed that everyone will like most of the tunes because of the contrast in styles if you buy one album this year make it this one,1
great cd very good cd it makes me think about everything and its good when your working or when your sleeping it have one or two bad songs but the rest are top quality my weekness always makes me think and put me in good mud and if you enjoy the essays of moby then you will love it i advice you to buy it,1
moby continues his great style the first song i ever heard of moby was his techno remix of james bond since then i have been hooked on his music and he certainly does not disapoint on this great album one thing that moby has is a unique sound he will never sound old or his style of music will never be used by others because no one could copy moby it is not rock nor techno it something in between on this album all the songs are strong but in particular i think the song why does my heart feel so bad is the best it pours out the most emotion without a doubt it was used in the trailers of black hawk down and was used perfectly overall if you are a fan of moby buy this album,1
do not fall for it your heart is not made of plastic why is this album held in such high regard it sounds like some middle class white kid messing with his parents gospel records the gritty heart felt gospel recordings juxtaposed with the cold synthetic superficial beats create an unsettling tension that sounds unintended he should be made to leave his room and go out and get some exercise,0
an album for christians and non christians alike you can dance groove bob your head and be touched emotionally all in one sitting this cd simply rocks,1
he gets it right your ears will thank you for buying this album you can really chill out to it with all the musical styles covered pop techno rock but where it really shines is the bluesy gospel electronic fusion with the awesome tracks natural blues run on yes i love the blues but you do not have to be biased towards any particular type of music to enjoy this album as it cleverly mixes most genres easily NUMBER stars as i can not think of any weak points on this,1
moby genius why people are saying that moby is like a god that he is one of the world best producer people say that his this record play is the album of the year i have heard this is the best techno album ever i can not understand this things please forgive me but in my view play is simply a bad album the only thing moby has made is sample some old soul vinyls and put music behind and believe me that the only good things of this album are these voices which are the only things moby has not made the drums are simply bad produced the music is simply and his voice is oh my god why anybody has say to moby that he can not sign you could say me you like some of the album songs but please do not say me that moby is a good producer and do not say that play is one of the best NUMBER album,0
there is no way this cd is one of the best of the NUMBER i purchased this cd because everyone is raving about it i mean i ever heard about it on a night time sitcom but whatever the case i found this cd a utter disappointment granted there are a couple tracks that i thought were okay but the rest of the cd was a waste i mean what is going on with the chanting the bottom line here is people loved this cd becasue it was new not that it was great,0
results in moby pulls off the album of the year i am not even done listening to every track yet yet i know this is the one moby pretty much pulls off the album of the year artists of the likes of madonna and beck will be calling this guy for some of his expertise he has broken ground by creating a beautiful unexpected hybrid gospel blues and electronic music forget fatboy slim or slim shady or will smith get with moby and get with him now play not only rocks your mind but touches your soul all without putting you to sleep being illegal or selling you out headphones recommended,1
let us play this was my first moby cd and i brought it for my fiance birthday we both love it we have brought the cd wait for me and last night since then moby knocks the socks off of lady g,1
new age muzak takes a hip hop why is not this guy on the wyndham hill label lightweight music and in the liner notes lightweight musings not necessarily bad but i do not own an elevator,0
a very good cd this is a very good cd you should buy it my favourite songs are why does my heart feel so bad porcelain guitar flute and stings and NUMBER although almost all songs on the album are good,1
remix i like the cd i found a real interesting way to be a part of moby music by mixing your own version of body rock at beatnik com,1
moby title simply says it play a really good cd i would not classify it techno but great pop it has it all dance rock slow medium my favorite cut is bodyrock gets my butt of the couch and rock i was surprised to see it as the theme song now to veronica closet on nbc you should catch the intro on the show it is pretty rockin any way back to the album other great songs are the ambient my weakness and the soul full run on catch this cd soon it will fit all tastes,1
never received it i am sure if i had received it instead of the cloth map that was sent i would have loved it i returned the map and asked that the light be sent as originally ordered this never happened and i ended up asking for a refund,0
loooooooooooove this book i read this book over NUMBER years ago and i tell you it still remains one of my faves even though i was barely NUMBER when i read it the book gave me hope and made me believe that anyone could become something no matter their background and especially like emma,1
the loudest stealth ever sadly this product performs admirably with supplying power but where it fails is its stealth check out oczs forums for many complaints about it being quite loud apparently they have kind of messed with all their customers and created an extremely loud product that is difficult to return to most e tailers fyi some retailers have newer revisions of these units that are much quieter but the upcs are exactly the same so good luck finding one buy it amazon or b m or better yet just stay away,0
i am glad i am not the only one this phone was fantastic for about NUMBER months i could go about NUMBER yards from my house while talking without any interference however in the last month the handset started channel searching no matter how close i was to the base and how good the signal two days ago the handset went into channel search mode and literally has not stopped searching since i have done everything i can think of including change the battery and it continues to search and while it searches the answering machine does not seem to work oh well no more sony for me,0
ditto do not waste your money we have had this telephone for about one year and we love the features however we have had to replace the battery already the replacement is very expensive as batteries go also the phone is constantly muting it makes a terrible clicking sound too resulting in having to ask people to repeat themselves over and over it must be channel surfing but there is no need for this i will be buying another phone but not a sony,0
pretty good wipes but a little thin i have been using pampers wipes pretty much from the beginning and i really love the pop up tub and the different fragrances they come in these sensitive ones are especially good for newborns my only complaint is they are thin i usually use NUMBER at a time more if my son has a messy diaper i recently tried huggies wipes and they are thicker but they do not pop up i do not like reaching in the tub as much as a the pop up so i guess i will stay with these,1
true corporate america probably the funniest movie about corporate america that i have ever seen from disgruntled employees to annoying co workers this movie has it all a definate buy if you enjoy movies like caddy shack and princess bride you will love this,1
satirical and funny i have just started studying an mba in the u s i am going through my second semester and i saw this film a couple of weeks ago the first ten minutes did not tell me anything good since it seemed one of those low budget c type uninteresting comedies that invite you to switch channel i am glad i did not because we eventually had a lot of fun with the dialogs and situations a long discussion after the film was finished and i saw lots of things that have to do with my management courses very recommendable either to de stress or to realize that that all the bad karma and nonsense by people who just want to control you and your life is what you want to avoid by all means on the job or in everyday life,1
trying the first word that came to mind while thinking of this film was but i will do it a bit of a service and say it merely trying i watched it on amazon instant i like the service but keep in mind i am no hard core cinephile my concern is the story alone not so much the technology and made it through to the end i felt rather ragged afterwards the character of milton left perhaps the biggest impression on me he looked and sounded and acted like a muppet particularly beaker that was a very trying element in this film i felt like i was watching a strange permutation of james thurber the catbird seat told in a backwards way from some unimportant background characters the protagonist did not feel like a protagonist the only really wonderful piece of acting was that of mr lumberg whose dry grueling that would be great stole the show it was grotesque and hilarious otherwise this was a legitimately unsatisfying film i do not plan on watching it again,0
office space blu ray review i purchased this through prime as an extra christmas gift for the household we have not had a chance to watch it yet but i have seen the movie before it one of the best movies ever and i will not even say what i paid for it on here because i do not know what they are asking for it now i just know that i got an exceptional deal i think it was a gold box or something i am looking forward to watching this version to see what the special flair is all about but i did get a great price on this shipping was fast through prime and i am happy with my purchase,1
perfect christmus gift for manager or co worker we recently organised a pot luck for our team an i selected this as gift i sticked yellow note sticker all over the dvd case and left the words work sucks visible out side when one of my co worker picked this gift and read read the sentence there was a big laugh in the room and when he opened removed the stickers every one said it was the perfect gift with perfect packing for the occasion anyway movie is one of my favourite and must watch,1
i believe you have my stapler ok a few years ago i worked for a major hmo last year i was also confined to a small gray cubicle for NUMBER hours a day and after watching office space i quit a month later coincidence maybe but it was like watching my life unfold on screen like having NUMBER bosses remind you about a tiny mistake that does not really matter the doggone fax machine that is your sworn enemy and of course the office freak who you know is going to someday show up to the work place armed this movie has it all and it hilarious so if you ever get a case of the mondays call in sick blow off those dang tps reports and watch this movie,1
love this movie i bought this for a friend who had never seen it i was going to let them borrow mine but decided to just get them their own since it was so reasonable got to love it,1
milton is the man aaahhhh this movie sticks with you and is total classic comedy from basic humor of just wierd names to the eternal red stapler this is an amazingly hilarious movie i have never even been inside a cubicle thank god and i think this movie may have influenced that milton certainly steals the show and then i see the same actor on a csi episode and realize he can talk normally and has no red stapler gasp but anyway anyone can enjoy this movie whether they are a cubie with a tyrant boss or standing in the unemployment line this is a new classic in my book,1
office space i ordered the movie office space but when i received it i had happy gilmore in an office space package it was sealed and everything i was very disappointed in amazon service in sending me the wrong movie will not do that again,0
some of the funniest scenes with an overall bland plot i love this movie it has so many individual scenes that are hilarious the overall plot and story are not the greatest but i have found most people can over look this this movie is rated r and i think its one of the tamest r movies i have seen there is brief nudity and a fair amount of swearing mainly in rap music however the r rating may be for the best since i do not think anyone under the driving age will think this movie is all that funny it mainly work related and relationship comedy i am thrilled to say there is no bodily fluid humor that has been in so many movies lately the dvd features are almost nonexistant,1
that greeeeat rather than comment on the film i will comment in the disc itself worthwhile set of extra features but it not an action film so the widescreen does not add much a note on the locker content NUMBER you may not be able to view it NUMBER it may lock up your browser NUMBER the deleted scene is on the disc anyway summary buy it if you like office space not because of the widescreen and digital locker content btw although it zone NUMBER ntsc it played just fine on my zone NUMBER pal dvd player,1
funny classic just like your were there this one makes me laugh everytime if you have ever worked in a cubicle you will appreciate the humor and the office politics,1
cult classic if you have ever worked in an office environment you have to see this movie i have watched this movie over NUMBER times and i still can not stop laughing i still use quotes from this movie on a daily basis,1
simply the best yeah i am going to have to go ahead and rent this movie again because i missed most of it due to the fact that i was laughing too hard to keep up with the story line seriously though this movie was simply the best movie i have ever seen other than the types of people the movie was being critical of mindless corporate suits and drones i can not imagine anybody not loving this film,1
life imitates dilbert if you have ever worked in a cubicle farm spoken corporatese or dealt with downsizing you will find office space to be hilariously relevant created by mike judge of beavis and butthead fame this movie could easily pass for a live action version of the dilbert cartoon it pokes fun at everything from commuting to office birthday parties to fast casual chain restaurants watching office space you will vicariously get the satisfaction of sticking it to the man ron livingston plays the lead role well but the funniest characters are the supporting cast milton lundbergh drew et al i am going to need you to go ahead an watch office space yeah that would be great,1
hate it this would have been a good movie but the language ruined it all will never watch again in fact will probably destroy it language like that does not make a movie,0
this is the only movie i have watch over NUMBER times i love this whole movie i is my all time favorite i am not really a movie goer but this is one that i have played over and over again and never get tired of it corprate account payable nina speaking just a moment i have been in a cube most my life and so much rings true this is a celebrated movie and a tribute to all of us that work in the corprate world i happen to like me work getting there was a struggle we all have been peter gibbons at one point or another in our career hey peter watch you corn there are so many lines from the movie that just make me laugh i know the budject for the movie was NUMBER mil and i knowthat opening week it did NUMBER mil NUMBER mill total but the dvd is a cult classic it must be reeling in the bucks,1
a great flick a must see for anyone that has ever worked in a cubicle environment hated work got pissed off at a printer hates the boss or feels trapped in a deadend job the deliberate humor slaps you in the face from the get go and continues to do so throughout the entire film if you need a good laugh to forget the stress of your crappy job then you need to see this movie,1
get out of your cubicle and see some real comedy although this movie has a few moments that will bring a smile to your face the same kind of smile you get as you pass gas it is certainly not among the best comedic efforts of all time a much better film in the same vein would be bruce robinson how to get ahead in advertising criterion collection executively produced by george harrison even some episodes of the drew carey show and the old mary tyler moore tv series are better than this film,0
busted dvd i ordered a widescreen version from this retailer not only did i get a fullscreen version in the mail along with an invoice that confirmed i ordered the widescreen the dvd would not play in any player i owned which is NUMBER tried to get in touch with customer service but after a nightmare and a long headache i decided to just give up my ten dollars as lost and buy the film at best buy do not use this retailer,0
not really that good when i started working in office and a cubicle all of my friends told me that i had to watch office space because it is so much like work and it hilarious finally i did get a chance to watch it but i ended up being quite diappointed yes there are some funny parts to the movie but i was more disgusted with some of the supposed humor it could be that i tend to like movies that have some value or even a plot even if it did not have either some humor could have been good i could have done without this movie but at least now my friends will quit bugging me to watch it word of advice i would not watch it with kids or with older parents actually i would not watch it at all,0
office space NUMBER this movie is for anyone who has suffered a printer jam worked next to someone loud and annoying had a boss from hell this movie will get you to laugh especially enjoyable on particularly bad week at work preferably cubical style,1
laughing at ourselves there are a lot of funny movies out there but not many can be said to have so perfectly skewered their subject that they become archetypes office space fits this latter category doing for the modern post NUMBER workplace what monty python and the holy grail did for the arthurian legend that is to say office space has become a part of our common culture with shared concepts like pieces of flair and is this good for the company being common to the experience not only of cubicle slaves but all of us further office space despite its outrageous plot is just close enough to the truth of modern corporate america to hit home companies do promote incompetents and lay off their most skilled workers all in the name of short term quarterly profits they do treat their employees like drones while rewarding upper management for cheating shareholders to see this all turned against them goes a long way in explaining the success of office space it a classic,1
so real it hurt the year was NUMBER i was working as a customer service representative in an office that looked eerily like the one in this movie you know one of those utterly bland suburban campuses our company had just hired efficiency consultants to analyze the business then one day a bunch of people get laid off while there management introduced a new phone system for tracking how we spent our time we actually had to enter a code to use the bathroom so they could know how much time we were there i remember sitting in the movie theater not sure whether i should laugh or cry now NUMBER years later i can definitely laugh i love the bit about the tps report memo and the red stapler lots of rough language but otherwise a real gem,1
not just another space shooter when i first began speculating about this game with friends way back in NUMBER all i heard was it was going to be another space shooter that could not rate up there with games like x wing or tie fighters man i still will never forget the looks on their faces when i showed them how the game ran and just overall was a masterpiece of graphics and gameplay for it time anyway so your saying yeah well what the story with this game well you start out as a gta pilot galactic terran alliance fighting a NUMBER year war against the vasudans the ai is impressive as is the combat animations and cutscenes all i can say to anyone considering buying this is to get it before it is no longer made considering it age enjoy,1
works great holds the phone cool looking for a charger i hate the phone charger business and have gone through piles of third party chargers over the years with my a NUMBER phone chargers would just fall out so far so good with this one plus the glowing tip besides just being neat o makes it easy to find i wish there was a way to tell top v bottom in the dark but that not really a problem and i have never had a charger that did highly recommended,1

steinbeck is good but e b white is better steinbeck book are often quite earthy and rough i think he had a macho image he wanted to maintain in part he was a good writer noble prize pulitzer and travels with charley is a wonderful book it is not in this collection however i find it difficult to swallow his profanity and it is never necessary read dickens for instance in comparison e b white had a gracious side to his writing a wonderful subtle sense of humor and a beauty of economy with the english language i like them both but prefer white i mention the two together because they were both writing at the same time they were both perfectionists and both hated to be in the public spotlight,1
what started out to be a beautiful movie thrown in the trash this was recommended to be a wonderful movie not to be missed in our local small town paper indeed it started out to be just that even with viewing it in between the english subtitles german made german language magnificent scenes of africa and beautiful people all through out then right in the middle and totally unnecessary by all standards very graphic sex scenes between NUMBER of the characters i could not believe it it ruined what could have been a totally beautiful movie in scenery and story i was so angry i immediately threw it in the biggest trash can i could find i was so angry i did not want to talk about it let alone give time to write a review until now enough said do not waste time or money on this movie i still have yet to speak to the man who wrote the recommendation but will the next time i see him i live out in the wilds of our island not in the town,0

good book obnoxious author the oregon trail is an undeniable classic although overrated compared to other books written about the same time about the same subject parkman is a priggish boston snob who complains his way across the west he despises the pioneers crossing the plains and has no interest in them a startling lack of consciousness for a historian the indians and the mountain men fare little better a better more generous book by a young man in the west is wah to yah and the taos trail by lewis h garrard smallchief,1
hardly the oregon trail this book was a disappointment to me and i should have researched it more before purchasing it it was my hope to read about the settlers moving west on the old oregon trail but this book had nothing to do with that instead it was an account of parkman experiences as he traveled in some of the western areas of the u s wyoming area black hills etc much of his time was spent with the various indian tribes as he befriended them and learned much of their culture he also spent a great deal of time hunting my real problem with his story is that it was so repetitive many of the accounts were similar and it seemed like we were going over and over the same thing i read almost every thing i can find on western adventure and exploration but this one is sure not on the top of my list,0
not a happy customer this seller claims that if not satisfied with the product they will issue you a refund as long as you send the product back within NUMBER days well is almost a month since i send the products back and i have not seeing no refund yet i tried calling and sending the seller messages with no luck they will not return my calls or write i also think that phone number given is fake because nobody ever answers the phone,0
a truly loud phone i purchased this phone for my NUMBER year old mother who wears two hearing aids not only can she finally hear me on the phone but she can use it while keeping her hearing aid in her ear she has not heard this well on the phone for over ten years i highly recommend this product,1
ho hum with all the great material in the wea vaults why warner music uk chose to package and release these also rans is a mystery the material has a boring sameness to it i am not used to in an oldies collection dee dee warwick darrow fletcher barbara lynn mary wells are all outstanding artists that i normally look forward to listening to but who you would not normally identify with the disco or pre disco period of american music the selections on this cd display these and other artists work out of their normal areas of expertise this one is surely going to a back shelf,0
exploitation of sibling this book was terrible it was an expolitation of his brother and a shameless way to promote his other books no matter the situation the author found a way to make a reference to another book he had wrote it was poorly written and jumps around quite a bit do not waste your time or money on this book or any book of this author,0
uninspiring cd the songs are third rated ones that do not inspire listening to these songs had to be one time only deal,0

good book bad digitization the digital copy of this book is poor with artifacts on almost every other page makes it difficult to read at points definitely not worth the price for the effort the publisher put in,0
dull i am not sure why this book got so many five star reviews it not a terrible book but i found it to be incrediably predictable and dull i had pretty much figured out everything that was going to happen within the first hundred pages or so there was not much point in finishing it i love long books but this one was pointlessly so wolfe goes into a lot of useless rambling that has little if nothing to do with the plot i found myself skimming many of the pages without feeling i has missed out on anything important definately the sort of book you read only if there is nothing else around,0
attention to detail the bonfire of the vanities clearly made several strong points about racism sexism and capitalism in america but i personally enjoyed the attention wolfe paid to developing the characters and situations each character was in all the plot lines are just built up by the indepth description of how each character was involved the reader is never left wondering why the characters are doing what they are doing but everything is very obviously connected by wolfe previous narrative that it gives the reader something to look to for clarification specific events such as the mayors obsession with mayonnaise who in the name of god would bring a half eaten jar of mayonnaise to a public meeting or sherman confusion in the bronx who on earth would take the trouble to shove a chair in a chicken wire fence in this neighborhood also shows the actual character detail orientedness and perhaps shows that focus on detail is an inherent human flaw,1
very good pretty good like the dc version very well done but i really hoped to see more of the earlier artwork by the original artists for the older chartacters,1
spans the generations of marvel characters a great gift for marvel readers and a coffee table book for marvel families this book brings back memories and provides helpful chronology in the sixties iron man was yellow the x men were blue and yellow and daredevil was black and yellow marvel sure liked yellow,1

could have had more surfing when i saw the cover i was very exited to see big wave surfing i was very unhappy with this movie as all the shot of the surfing scene are taken from a helicopter its a nice introduction to big wave surfing but nothing compare to riding giants or the billabong odisey the rock climbing was also so so the snow board scenes are nice as always but nothing special overall this blu ray is good but does not show you anything new or that you event seen before,0
review by christine stevens it has the episode angel on it w david boreanaz what eles do you want,1
nice set of songs there is nothing bad to say about this excellent collection of songs no matter how many times they have been released before the songs have stood the test of time and are classic performances by the most classic entertainer of any genre of all time if you do not already have a collection of these songs i would highly recommend that you purchase this set and enjoy the feel good music there is only one elvis,1
what i expected these headphones delivered exactly what i expected from a NUMBER set good sound but lacking in the noise cancellation department the fabric cord with an extension piece is nice and the design makes it fun to wear the switch for noise cancelling on off is well located as it does not take up room on a seperate piece or on the cord and the foldable design makes the headphones relatively easy to transport with big pockets basicly everything one can expect from sony for NUMBER since flying with them i would change this to a NUMBER review they just did not deliver much with the noise cancelling,1
terrible headphones i only bought these because my cat chewed on my sony fontopia headphones and i was low on cash and these were on sale for NUMBER i figured they hold me over for a week or two a minute into the first song i regretted buying them first of all they are ugly as all hell the only reason i got them is because they said they were noise cancelling and the original price was NUMBER the noise cancelling consists of a distracting static frequency and there is no bass whatsoever these are honestly terrible headphones i should have gotten NUMBER sony earbuds i would have been much happier,0
another verbal window into the past once again mcdermott verbal mastery takes you to the place of which she writes as clearly as if looking through a window on the scenes she describes so vividly however compared to charming billy this piece is disappointing while very well written descriptively i found it slow the opening act caught my attention and i continued to read hoping for more of the same alure it was not to be found i actually skipped paragaphs and entire pages and was able to continue as if the skipped parts were of no importance to the story at all while i would recommend ms mcdermott work i would not recommend this particular book,0
disappointed i did not find the music relaxing or energizing i was too distracted by the fact that it reminded me of bad early NUMBER s music but on the plus side it made me want to put on a shiny leotard and leg warmers,0
inspiring i listened to this book on cd which i have found is a great way to get insirational advice everyday and further myself as a person i loved c s lewis mere christianity it gives a educated view into why he believes in god and more specifically the christian god he is a great writer and the book is very intellegent i would recommend this book to anyone and everyone,1
primitive concepts outdated by todays understanding i have no doubt that c s lewis was a fine man and he certainly set out to achieve a noble goal here making the spiritual more understandable through the application of logic has an undeniable appeal unfortunately his assumptions about some of the basic concepts of human nature look positively naive by modern standards he comes off sounding like as one of my psych professors was fond of saying a park bench philosopher behavioral science just had not developed to the point it has today so he had no way of knowing that his basic assumptions about some things he viewed as givens were in fact not given at all in the end trying to make the subject of religion something that one can put to the test of logic is an exercise in futility that why it called faith,0
merely the same things rehashed i recieved this book as a gift from someone i thought to be an open minded good person this book has nothing new in it it is worthless it is just another example of a poor deluded sob trying to convince himself that he really likes the cage he was tricked into entering this book is prosylazation prosylatizers i have found try to convert people because they are insecure about their faith and think that by converting the world they will be secure in their faith the truly faithful person does not prosylatize for if one is secure in one faith why preach if i could give this book a negative five i would,0
disappointing and childish i bought this book hoping to find an intelligent defense of faith given that the author is such a well respected fiction writer unfortunately what i found were the kinds of arguments that i used while in grade school and discarded soon thereafter if you have thought critically about anything at any point in your life you are not going to get anything out of this book,0
quality works in poor quality packaging for the last week i have been like a little child waiting for a birthday present to come in the mail i have joyfully anticipated receiving this boxed set of c s lewis treasures at last it came today what a disappointment if the covers of these books last through more than one reading i will be surprised the covers are beautiful but the quality is poor and certainly not worth the NUMBER NUMBER i paid for this set i was looking forward to something that would last for years to come oh well i will not be sending the set back because i am anxious to read these incredible works the first books i will have read in several years if this review was about c s lewis it would be five stars but this review is about the shoddy quality of this set and hence the single star review buyer beware,0
the best explanation of the core of christianity i have read fascinating it has been a while since i last got excited about a book but this book inspired me this book gives both rational arguments for christianity and sound explanations of core christian doctrines,1
book the book took a while to get here and when it did it was in rough shape for supposedly being brand new i also discovered i could have bought it for NUMBER cheaper from another online retailer not too impressed with this purchase,0
one more review hundreds of reviews of this book have been written over the years and no wonder it author did not become a christian til in his NUMBER when he came as he tells it kicking and screaming into the kingdom he heavy weight intellectual taught both oxford and cambridge but able to write clearly for us commoners as well the many copies i have given away over the years have gone to christians who need a clearer understanding of their faith as well as to nonchristians who need to understand that christianity is quite intellectually respectable and possibly even true,1
seeing the truth in the logic for those of us that are more logical and analytical in our thinking cs lewis illustrates logically the need to not only acknowledge but address the existence of god but make a choice in where we stand and what we consider truth use this as a starting point in a lifelong journey to gain an accurate picture of who god is,1
great book loved kindle for ipad can not go wrong i buy as many books as possible this way quick down load and you get your stuff right away,1
why all the hype a huge letdown in all fairness i was not able to finish this novel the author seems to have a singular obsession with things sexual to the exclusion of most of the important characteristics of a good story if you like the theme of a woman sexual liberation read chopin the awakening or lawrence lady chatterley lover instead besides the sex is much better in lcl in addition to tackling this controversial subject these books are masterfully written and classics for all time,0
not very enlightening as someone who has a genuine phobia of flying i thought that this book might provide some useful insights after about a hundred pages i realized that it was just a lot of lurid filth it is a total con i ended up throwing it off the train somewhere in the middle of manitoba probably the biggest rip since the neverending story,0
a disappointing book the heroine is a bloody racist which is taken for wit i guess what a turn off,0
too thin i wanted to like these pants so bad i am NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER lbs and they were too short for me i guess i am a little anal when it comes to my pants being long enough but regardless they were way too thin i have a pair of adidas and prefer their dry fit fabric over these these are for sure a summer pant,0
why do people like this the costumes and sets are not too bad but otherwise this looks like a bad tv movie from the NUMBER s usually does i agree that there is less of the melodrama than in cecil demille film but the writing and acting are still painful to watch and the picture is always dark it must be that people feel nostalgic about something from years gone by because this movie looks so very bad compared to classics of the past and modern filmmaking,0
magnifique eurasia most inspired duo flashbacks envelope a bullet to the future not for the faint of heart,1
futuredoc i have been through most of the test preperation books in the market but this i was very optimistic upon coming to this book the book itself is not written in a user friendly manner and the best parts of this book are the NUMBER NUMBER word vocab list the math section is very comprehensive however the questions are a lot harder than those found on the sat which eventually starts to discourage you i verbal review sections are practically useless and the strategies do not work once again buy this book only for the vocabulary list and then move on to some other book such as kaplan etc this list will give you the foundation to answer analogies and sentencecompletions but nothing more the practice tests are quite useless and are much harder than that found on the real sat good luck on you test preperation,0
solid math review but lacks application for the sat having tested many books that deal with the sat i was positively surprised by the depth this book provided the problem is the fact that the sample questions in it do not really reflect the real sat test and can only be used to study the math or the critical thinking skills also do not plan to use this book to brush up your vocabulary the included word list provides you with only the meanings of the words and not with a sample sentence this book might be suitable for usage in combination with NUMBER real sats or some other book that features more realistic sat questions,0
below average cd i was left very disappointed this is probably the worst cd sawyer brown has ever came out with out of the NUMBER songs only about NUMBER are worth listening to i recommend you listen to it before you waste any of your hard earned cash on this,0
a story hidden in words way too many names way too much detail there is a story hidden in this book but it is hard to dig it out it could have been a good read,0
aimless and self absorbed this book was one of the most boring books i have had to read in a long time i found the writing to be unimaginative and felt like the book had no direction i was very disappointed and had forgotten it before it was even finished,0
could have been a fun movie for the kids with the slinging of rubber playground balls and the realistic sound of the ball hitting and stinging its mark how they capture that and the bathroom humor this could have been a movie that i enjoyed with my children however the sexual innuendo and outright poor language as well as the girl girl kiss and crotch enhancement received by the stiller character makes this a movie that i am tossing in the trash can what a drag,0
not worthy of one star if the academy gave out oscars for worst movie worst acting and worst script this would win hands down when it comes to lame witless and downright stupid movies ben stiller is on quite a roll if you are not a teenaged boy i recommend staying away from this one dodgeball fancies itself as a parody of the typical sports movie do not fall for it the non stop toilet humor is lame and predictable and it a wonder that this movie can garner such rave reviews from so many people in my humble opinion if you have an iq greater than NUMBER do not bother with dodgeball personally i sooner watch a marathon of paulie shore and carrot top movies before sitting thru dodgeball again and that my friends is saying something,0
worth the price of admission i do not know how anyone could not laugh at this movie it seems to appeal to all types of audiences that enjoy light humor i wasnt a fan of ben stiller until this move he is very funny in it despite the focus on humor it is not entirely predictable and has some suprises in store for the audience,1
not bad this movie was really silly but i thought it was quite watchable i was impressed actually i would not mind watching it again usually i do not like ben stiller movies but i laughed at some of the stuff he did in this one i guess it may be because i respect antagonists more than protagonists the plot in this movie does not matter much no one cares about it this movie is for nothing but cheap laughs fortunately the cheap laughs are not limited to endless shots of people getting hit in the groin there a whole variety of goofy humor my favorite part is the black and white short film on dodgeball they watch sometimes the humor gets a bit silly though there a guy who walks around in the film dressed as a pirate for no reason at all i thought the whole pirate thing was the worst part of the movie still it was not enough to tarnish the entire work i recommend checking this out for a rental laugh at some parts and not at others go with the flow,1
good read for ca students wanting to learn about their histo i am trying to locate the abridged version that i taught from in the NUMBER s it out of print and i would love to get come copies of it if anyone has any to use with my not so good readers now if you find any please call me at NUMBER NUMBER,1
rating the physical book not the story this book is an excellent story lots of california history or better alta california as it was known in the era beware of the physical book it is about NUMBER x NUMBER printing of the story is very pale i will keep this but have ordered an older normal paperback version similar to the one i left accidentally at the san diego airport terrible size and print itself find another book of ramona by helen hunt jackson and be ready to want to go to old town san diego michaelene gon,0
had to return it after i install this blower fan it made a loud ticking sound so i thought maybe it was hitting something i uninstalled in and ran the fan uninstalled it still made the loud ticking noise so i had to return it the bad part was that amazon deducted NUMBER NUMBER from the price i paid for the fan because i did super saver shipping i do not recommend buying this fan or any auto parts from amazon com since they do not stand behind defective products,0
awsome i would recommend this product to everybody with a baby in the house first it allows you to keep the baby clean because the bibsters are quite big second they are waterproof and learning to drink out of a cup is always wet and third no washing and a new clean spotless bib each time makes parenting a bit easier,1
NUMBER stars by far our favorite toy this toy is by far our favorite i do not know how many hours total our son has spent hammering the balls and then watching them go through the maze sometimes he uses the hammer sometimes he just pounds them with his hand the hammer is not that hard so when he does decide to hammer dad head it does not hurt that much if your child is less than NUMBER it will take a few days playing with the toy before he she masters it and pounds the balls with confidence they learn the toy if we had NUMBER toy to take with us on a trip this would definitely be the one highly recommend,1
wtf video only absolutely no sound from this ntsc dvd i tried it on multiple machines and several computers no dice the soundtrack is absent you have an ideal picture of the artists performing their very silent show not very satisfying i rather hear and not see a band than see and not hear a band just a bit pissed in puyallup wa,0
looking back with love a tantalizing performance by kathleen turner anyone with a soul sometimes wants to go back in life to discover the great what if in this film peggy sue gets that chance to possibly change her life by going back there turner pulls it all off in grand style the realities she learns are not as profound as she might think they are nevertheless viewing this film might provoke a thought journey because its done so well and with care watch for leon ames and other older stars written by jerry leichtling and arlene sarner,1
it is like going back in time i love this movie i love it because it lets me go back to my grandmother who i miss every day of my life but when i am watching this movie i am somehow with her again even if only for a few moments it also lets me be a again remembering a time long gone by but never quite forgotten for me this is a movie sprinkled with tears but rich with wonderful memories of yesterday let us face it we all would love to go back to a previous time and place even if just for a moment this movie is the next best thing,1
cutting edge got these bits a couple of weeks ago to replace a NUMBER year old craftsman set the first thing i noticed was the heft of the assortment same number of bits as the craftsman but considerably heavier have mainly used a couple of the larger ones on a cast iron grill they chewed through like it was pine have used some of the smaller bits to drill out rusted bolts you only need to watch the metal filings pile up to know they are doing their job have not used any on wood seems like overkill and my older ones do fine for those i only wish the storage box had a more positive lock mechanism but i do like its bright size markings sure beats stamped metal which i can never read in weak light all in all i am very pleased and the price was great,1
funny girl this is a very good movie it is so easy to be able to order old movies and enjoy them again and again,1
do not buy this edition of democracy and education this edition of the book is absolutely awful the type is small and printed in a grayish fuzzy font that is hard to read the margins are almost nonexistent there is no space to write notes not even at the bottom of the page you will notice that this book is only NUMBER pages whereas i recently found a very good used copy that is NUMBER pages both are unabridged but in this edition the text is crammed onto the pages also just scanning through the book today i quickly found two typos avoid this cheaply constructed edition i sincerely hope amazon stops selling it,0
nice book clean neat white one made of paper the cover is shiny with words is anyone getting my pointgood bye,1
had to buy it i was forced to buy this for a grad class and it was absolutely boring i was happy with the price and that about it,0
lazy publisher the edition of jude the obscure that i believe you are seeing on this page the signet paperback with the two horses on the cover first came out in NUMBER and has not been touched since then except to add a bibliography in NUMBER there is a helpful NUMBER page afterword by al alvarez but that it signet has just been reissuing and reissuing the same thing for over four decades with the signet though there are no footnotes you are just getting the bare text that means that you will have zero help with hardy rustic or ecclesiastical terms not to mention the abundant latin in short get this one jude the obscure oxford world classic in which said defect is remedied and unlike the signet in which the text has adjusted to reflect modern spelling and pronunciation the oxford world classics is hardy original text as he saw it published,0
jude the mundane thomas harding overly descriptive writing style backfired in this would be entertaining novel hardy should have realized that the harsh reception of the novel by the public was probably more because it boring than because of the controversial text hardy ruined a perfectly good plot with excessive description and annoying detail,0
not an easy read i did not enjoy reading this one i know hardy is not the most cheery writer but this was beyond just depressing it was boring about halfway through i was tempted to just skip the rest but i trudged on to the bitter end this may have been scandalous when it was published but why could not hardy have done a better job with the ending the almost dickensian sequence of hard to swallow tragedies was too contrived for my taste was hardy afraid of writing a happy ending for this unconventional pair or did he want to display the worst case effects of a rigid social code of behavior either way it all became pretty unbelievable from a historical point of view as a jumping off point for a discussion of the social constraints and morals of the period jude is a success it certainly seems to have set off some fireworks when it was first published as casual reading i can not recommend it,0
ok products horrible warranty service if you purchase millennium products by farberware do not count on getting any satisfaction if you need to use the warranty i sent in three pieces NUMBER months ago for what i was told was a NUMBER week process i am still waiting and every time i call i get a different line they are either incompetent or lying or both decent products unacceptable customer service buyer beware,0
the origin of betty boop helen kane is the flapper who was the model for betty boop when you listen to this cd you can appreciate just how well mae questal who provided the voice of betty boop imitated helen kane the music on this cd is great fun not only do you get to hear more complete versions of songs that betty boop sings but there are also songs like he so unusual that betty boop should have sung,1
works good works great now i get the best steamed veggies the company sent it fast i give the company and the steamer NUMBER star,1
combo saucepot and steamer just love this little pot have been a farberware user for over NUMBER years and finally replaced my NUMBER quart saucepan with this gem it a great size for a small family does not take up much room on the stovetop only concern is that the handles do get hot and you need to use a glove or towel to use the handles after boiling or high temps i would recommend this pot to anyone in the market for mini size soup stew preparations,1
be careful it hot very hot on the handles i agree this is a solid cookware but it is so hot on the handles everytime i try to remove it from the stove i believe they can do something about the design of the handles btw my hands are not so sensitive to heat normally but this is super hot beyond my tolerance,0
great steamer got this mainly for veggies works great and fast very pleased with it it could be a little bigger but can hold NUMBER servings,1
excellent book to tell the truth i was a bit hesitant to purchase this book as loosing my joy was not something to which i was willing to admit john piper does not disappoint his books are deep which is exactly what i needed as there are just too many superficial books on various christian topics which tend to lack substance or depth or have any real effect in changing one heart john piper tells it like it is and gets to the heart of the matter i am so glad i finally gave in and purchased this book i have been blessed and i have been able to rediscovered the joy of the lord that i had when i was first saved if you can not handle the truth and are not wanting to actually put the time and struggle into what it takes to truly abide with god on a deeper level than this book is not for you if you are a mature believer who needs a good kick in the pants than this is the book for you awesome book if it is what you need then you will not be disappointed,1
great great great i was looking for inexspensive hdmi cords for my ps NUMBER and my new hd tv well everyone told me u have to get monster cables there like NUMBER blah blah blah well i found these and thought hey there cheap so if they do not work oh well boy i was wrong they are great the tv is amazing and the ps NUMBER games look sooo good you do not need those over priced monster cables they shipped to me fast i even got them earlier than exspected i know i was checking my mail box daily i will definatly buy from this company again thanks guys,1
very poor quality for hdmi after two years of using component cables for my xbox NUMBER and a year of using a monster hdmi cable for my ps NUMBER i decided that the difference in quality between the two was noticable enough for me to go out and buy another hdmi cable for my xbox after shopping around and seeing the price and reviews for this cable i bought it and in all honesty this cable is much worse than even my component cables i tried a few different movies and a few different games all to no avail characters in my games are choppy and pixelated and all of the movies even in hd quality are blurry i decided to switch the two cables to see if it was just my xbox and immediately noticed the difference this is a poor cable and i would not reccomend it to anyone who cares about the quality of the graphics on their screen,0
works ok but you need extra adaptor if using headset and hdmi for NUMBER the hdmi cable works ok with our plasma someone was asking if was only for lcd before but if you are using it with your xbox NUMBER and you have a headset turtle beach type not the regular ones you will also need the adaptor for audio out i should have checked before because the adaptor by itself is more expensive than cable and adaptor together at least here in amazon otherwise no problem recommended especially for the price,1
hdmi cable this hdmi cable category NUMBER has not fail me at all it works great and displays up to NUMBER p i highly recommend this hdmi cable,1
great price do not buy branded cables if you can tell the difference between the images and sounds these cables transmit and those transmitted by more expensive cables you are not likely to be reading reviews of this generic item these work well for any hdmi connection do not spend more than a few dollars per cable,1
adult who enjoys good children videos this was very amateurish do not think it would hold even the attnetion of a child no matter what age,0
the last unicorn vhs actually i would like the option to give this tape a NUMBER star rating i bought this video for my pre school aged nephews as a christmas gift i thought a rankin bass video would be good safe for children i finally watched it with them the other day i was very disappointed and would not recommend this movie for anyone the characters in the story swear a haggish woman swears at the unicorn saying damn you damn you the knight hero character says damn a troll type creature says something like what the hell am i supposed to look at and a magician takes god name in vain after being accosted by a tree he brought to life which is a buxom woman tree who makes a pass at the magician shocking if my nephews went up to their parents and used these expressions from the movie they would be reprimanded by their parents who do not talk like that i now know that i need to preview every video i buy for my nephews before giving them a present shame on rankin bass,0
can not manage to think about it the last unicorn is a terrible movie for one the dvd release was very poor and some aspects of the film were not made for children or anyone for that matter there is not really a point to this film so do not buy it,0
the last unicorn if i could give this a half star i would i bought this for my children to watch and i felt with a rated g rating that i was safe how wrong i was i am ashamed to say that i let my children see this before i did when the magician is tied to the tree and his magic brings the tree to life all i see is the tree and her huge breasts and the magician is stuck between her cleavage the world is getting sick enough that i do not need to show a cartoon to my children with this garbage in it i am highly disappointed and so are my children because they can not watch this movie i think that you need to watch this movie first before showing small children,0
i like unicorns but this blah the last unicorn stinks you really should not see it some people like it but i think it a bad movie and does not have really good characters people who like it like it we all have different opinions,0
great movie shoddy dvd the last unicorn was my favorite movie when i was a kid the story is sweet the animation lovely i eagerly bought a copy on vhs when i saw it some years ago and awaited the release of the dvd with glee unfortunately my glee was somewhat unfounded while the movie itself is still as wonderful as ever the dvd itself is shoddy work the movie is only presented in fullscreen though there was a widescreen laser disc available there are no extras even the picture quality is less than outstanding if you are looking to replace a worn vhs this is certainly a good option if on the other hand you are waiting for a dvd treatment worthy of this beautiful movie you have more waiting ahead of you,0
fantastic movie worse transfer seen dvd i remember seeing the last unicorn when it was first released in the NUMBER and loved it ever since the story should keep adults interested throughout with a wonderful story about dreams love and sacrifice the voice acting is first rate as well as the soundtrack yet the transfer onto dvd is the worst i have even seen the opening titles are blurry the picture fuzzy one review questioned that it may have came from the master vhs i would not even go that far it a very poor copy as for the sound if you have NUMBER NUMBER surround you will hear music and the voices coming from all directions i view my movies on a hdtv and that even no help as for extras there are none not even a trailer so should you get it its nice to have it added to my collection but expect a poor vhs viewing vice the clear dvd,0
fantasy or reality i have always loved this movie and was so excited to learn it was on dvd finally a wonderful cast and wonderful music i could watch it again and again i love it,1
a truly beautiful film when i was about four or five years old i loved to watch the last unicorn spotting it at blockbuster i decided to rent it wondering how i would see it now i was worried when i saw that the animation was rankin bass but in the end i found it to be a visual confection some of the characters do look a little cheesy but most of the time the animation dazzled me in particular mommy fortuna tree stump hat is very cool forestscapes are ethereal and i love molly big brown eyes my favorite scene is the meeting of molly and the unicorn the woman is angered that the unicorn came to her at a low point in her life rather than when she was new and innocent after that schpiel molly embraces her and whispers i forgive you to my mind this is one of those works like the little prince or the mouse and his child that is meant for chidren but is sincere enough to captivate adults as well well done,1
possibly the worst dvd transfer i have ever seen first things first this is a nice movie for kids particularly little girls the story is compelling though the animation is pretty lousy the music written by the estimable jimmy webb and sung by america is quite good i give the movie NUMBER stars on the whole NUMBER stars for a little girl now for this particular dvd it absolutely attrocious the picture looks no better than an average vhs cassette worse much worse the soundtrack suffers from noticable pitch inconsistencies it sounds like a dub from a bad cassette tape there is no excuse for this and i have never seen or heard a poorer dvd transfer if you already own this movie on vhs there no reason to spend any money to get his version it surely no better than the copy you have and is because of the soundtrack wow and flutter arguably worse,0
untitled i love this movie so much i have been watching it for years and i have yet to grow tired of it it is a great movie with beautiful songs and music the story line will capture you this is definately one of my favorite movies,1
good movie this is a great movie i first saw it when i was about NUMBER and i still love it beware of the profanity i recently saw it again and i was surprised to hear the bad language because of the g rating,1
an all time classic people of all ages love this story it is currently a movie and a book and both are equally fantastic the last unicorn has been my favorite movie for as long as i can remeber this movie will never leave you stranded it has all the elements a fantasy story should have buy it while you can because this movie will remain for years to come and the longer you wait the more expensive it will be this movie is a true classic,1
next best thing to being in a chicago blues club not sure why i added this one to my large collection but it is now one of my favorites my biggest regret is not getting to see him live before he died unlike some cds where there is only one or NUMBER good songs this one has lots of great songs,1
yet another version another vocalist the sound musically is good that the only reason i give it one star but for the vocals no stars if you do not care who sings then buy it i regret buying this cd because the vocals do not appeal to me take advantage of the listen to songs when available unfortunately on this cd that option is not available but many others do have it,0
awesome drum for a crappy drummer this drum is sweet it looks amazing coming out of the box a classic beautiful design i swapped the stock weather master heads for an emperor coated clear ambassador reso also swapped stock snares for NUMBER strand wires no complaints about sound from this beauty my only complaint to date is the strainer the standard p NUMBER strainer would often get snagged when moving the snares from off to on this sucks big time when you are in the middle of a song fighting with the strainer to co operate i got desperate and almost snapped the arm off it once this may have been a problem on my end seating it incorrectly or something i will soon swap to a p NUMBER strainer also watch out for fingerprints on this the chrome looks awesome when it clean however fingerprints really stand out and drive me mad minor detail but thought it was worth mentioning overall very good drum if mine got stolen or destroyed in a fire i would buy another,1
one glaring omission one glaringly bad inclusion what were they thinking when they put this collection together yes it has almost almost all of elvis greatest hits but where is one night and why why why would they dare to include elvis horrendous live version of polk salad annie and omit a classic like one night it is for that glaring omission and that glaringly bad inclusion that i give this collection a rating of NUMBER rather than NUMBER hey i love elvis presley music as much as anyone but he had no business recording polk salad annie there only one version of that song that should ever be heard and that the original by the song writer tony joe white,1
a book for the ages i mistakenly checked this book out of the library when i was in NUMBER th grade NUMBER thinking it was going to be about knights the silver sword imagine my surprise when upon reading the first page i discovered it was about a young boy my age separated from his family during wwii yet even that first page sucked me in i was not an avid or even a good reader at that age but i could not put it down and finished the book in two days i proceeded to check it out at least once a year until i could no longer find it in libraries it was probably the single biggest reason i learned to love reading my son is now in NUMBER th grade and i logged on to see if i could find it and will make sure it becomes a part of his life as well,1
no joy here the site of an immaculately turned out susan hampshire in thick eyeliner and gleaming white flared trouser suit prancing through the serengeti should serve as an immediate red flag this is about as far as you can get from bill travers and virginia mckenna charming performances in born free never mind invoking the real adamsons who led interesting and ultimately tragic lives does not seem much like kenya in the fifties to me i was there give it a miss,0
disappointing this born free sequel lacks authenticity the two leads show a loving relationship when the opposite is well known and credibility how in the world could the three young cubs shown have survived on their own for as long as they supposedly did it also boring,0
mini shuttle astronaut i love this item it occupies the top shelf of my sci fi shrine next to my tiny star trek models,1
born free this film is great for family i watched online through amazon prime and it played perfect and was so crystal clear i recommend this movie for all families this movie will make you laugh and cry it is that great i will order this dvd through amazon com soon and add it to my library this movie is also educational for everyone i just love all cats wild or tame i have my own domestic cat called snowy he is NUMBER years old now and mostly all white with a little apricot on his ears and tail he also has light blue eyes cats rule dogs drool sorry i am just kidding i like all animals,1
born free this is an excellent movie the quality is not as good as it should be but its great to watch after all these years,1
the family under the bridge this book had great characters and plot it took place in paris france it is about a family without a home my favorite character is armand the tramp the illustrations really added to the story i can see why it won a newberry medal i would recommend this book to everyone,1
cute story with difficult vocabulary for kids this book set in paris in late december follows a hobo named armand who gruff on the outside but reveals his inner warmth when he finds a newly homeless family living under his bridge while this book does have many good points this is not a book i would recommend the story would be very entertaining to a fifth grader but the vocabulary skills and difficulty understanding paris or gypsies would frustrate a reader in this age group a sixth grader however would more easily comprehend the vocabulary i admit that i did not know many of the words and had to guess at their meaning in context and i do not consider my vocabulary skills poor by any means and cultural situations but they would be bored by the simplistic story in all i would not recommend it not because it is a bad book but because i think there are better choices out there,0
the family under the bridge this book the family under the bridge is about an old hobo named armand he and a family live in paris armand the old hobo pushed all of his belongings around in an old baby buggy that had no hood one day armand took the calcet children suzy paul evelyne to see father christmas a whilr later armand took the children and their mother to a gypsy camp where they lived for a few days but then the gypsys moved away and they were again homeless and because armand loved the children so much he got a job at the halles and while he was there he could picture the wholr family sitting and playing in the house and until then they have lived happily ever after,1
mitford years ammended very fast response to my request excellent condition of the book would heartily recommend,1

perfect thank you for the prompt delivery and the book arrived in the described condition the book was great and i really love the whole series,1
absolutely the best i have worn nars sunset strip lip gloss for over NUMBER years and still continue to get compliments on the color i have tried all the other major brands dior la prairie laura mercier and bobby brown to name a few and nothing begins to compare the color saturation is perfect and the formula is great without being too sticky many brands do not stay put but the nars is always there i think the one major difference is that i always use a lip pencil first this helps to intensify the color and hold the gloss on the lip unfortunately i have been informed that they are discontinuing this color but they have a new one called wonder that looks similar anyway regardless of the color i highly recommend nars lipgloss,1
better than expected my foot doc recommended i use this first instead of going in for surgery for a bunion he told me to wear it for at least NUMBER months at night so far it been about NUMBER months and i do see a minimal difference with the severity of the bunion i can wear a pair of narrow shoes now that i previously could not it not an overnight cure but i would recommend this for anyone with a stage NUMBER bunion issue it looks cheap but it surprisingly durable it may feel a bit uncomfortable for the first few nights but you get used to it,1
the shadows between the poltergiest the legacy book the shadows between left me in the dark even through the story was interesting to read i had to real follow the plot carefully the story start with the appearance of a man david carson arriving at the legacy house who he is and where he came from is discovered as the story moves on in the book i am a fan of the series and the books except for this one it was slow going and for one to understand what is happenning in the story you have to read very carefully or read it a second time i did enjoy reading the other books in the series but the shadows between left me confused about what was going on sorry,0

warning misleading listing this item is advertised as being the r rated original version it is not it is the reissued and censored gp NUMBER version which is not nearly as good or as funny the listing should be corrected and we can only hope that one day the studio will release the dvd in its original version,0

okay i was about NUMBER years old when this movie was in the movie theaters and being a fan of brooke shields i watched endless love and i actually liked it but unfortunately i let some people convince me that it was not a good movie to like but now that i am older i find that i like this movie again and think it was good so i am editing an older review that i wrote in which i gave it a low rating of two stars but i now would rate it NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER stars,0
misrepresented usefulness book was advertised to help with any type of writing it is not it is only useful for improving the writing of articles ie newspaper mag etc,0

caution with this supplier this product is ok however unlike the discription claims it is not easy to cut even with new sharp tools the seets that i recieved tend to be very hard almost like lenoleum tile for your floor but even harder serface then even those either the product some where got exposed to extreame heat or its old,0
all show no go the key word in the title is unique i will give it that i am sure the contents pass muster as art and in that regard i know what i like this ai not it most of these tracks take forever to go anywhere and sound like chip davis co have just discovered synthesizers and looping software the only really listenable track is zip a dee doo dah which establishes fairly quickly and at least sounds like the song it supposed to be even it along with most of the others is a study in hey mom watch this sound effects generation unworthy of either the disney moniker or mannheim steamroller when you wish upon a star tangled up with twinkle twinkle little star with neither really coming to the fore borders on insulting jiminy cricket would not be happy unless you are a fan of early moog experiments pass on this one,0

a kitchen staple i love this pan i use it practically every day we received one for our marriage and after NUMBER years i finally had to replace it a second one we received a few years later is still holding up beautifully the pan is the perfect size for a can of soup or vegetables or a gravy mix i absolutely love it,1
great movie i live in rutherford county and my husband worked for damon huskey on which the movie is based some of the things were a little far fetched but all in all is depicted as he lived the part of the movie of the NUMBER officers that were killed was based on actual events as it took place on that horrible evening may NUMBER st NUMBER my husband was working that day and spend hours in the woods looking for the shooter so far this movie has only been available on vhs and would love to see it on dvd but it is worth watching to see how a country sheriff did all that was expected of him and then some kind of like buford pusser in walking tall but he did not carry a big stick just a big gun,1
i believe he is right stanley tam believed in principles and in his faith his story is truly amazing and his success can not be disputed regardless of your faith or lack thereof the author does a great job in humbly recapping his lifetime achievements for our benefit give him a chance to tell you his story i believe only good things will come of it,1

a huge adams fan finally must face reality as a long time douglas adams fanatic read all NUMBER of the trilogy at least a dozen time even wrote down every noun in all NUMBER for a database i read both last chance to see and dghda and loved them then i read this sequel and had to admit that it was likely the worst book i ever encountered i did not laugh once and literally had to force myself through it with several lapses between readings odin and thor bored me senseless i can now understand why there been no third addition to the series time wasted on this could have been much better spent working on yet another hhg novel,0
gods walk among us this is the NUMBER nd dirk gently novel and like the first it is good fun with adams trademark sense of humour an explosion at heathrow is called by the press an act of god and it turns out to be more than tabloid hyberbole as dirk gently soon discovers the feel of the novel is reminiscient of thorne smith night life of the gods but although adam style is always enjoyable the novel seems a little thin all wit and little substance given adams notorious bouts with writer block maybe his publishers were unwilling to wait for it to be properly polished,1
boring i had read somewhere that this foreign german i think slasher flick was good so i rented it thank goodness i buy it and was really disapointed the dubbing is bad and the plot is so unoriginal basically a maniac escapes from an aslyum who likes to kill people with big scissors at the same time some teenagers decide to party in a spooky old school where they just graduated from there is alot of running around people crawling through air vents and of course stabbings it is not even gory if you are into that sorta thing and the beginning which is like a rip off of scream is just plain silly skip this one or rent it if you have insomnia,0
you have got to be kidding me i am absolutely appalled and saddened to see a book with this title i have been lost in the labyrinth for the past decade i have no need for a condescending book of this ilk the title alone makes me want to vomit shame on the authors and anyone associated with it alzheimer disease is too complex a disease for a manual this deeply disturbs me m,0
sucked i should have known that a van damme movie would not be worth the time or money it simply sucked,0
poor quality product after NUMBER nd or NUMBER rd usage inside of the pots started to tarnished not a food stain now the food cooked using these tarnished pots are tasting bit bitter metallic taste very poor quality product,0
amazing bargain for the quality i love this cookware i had to leave my old kitchen things behind when i moved suddenly last fall due to illness and had gotten some cheap crud at wal mart big mistake after just NUMBER months it was a mess so i went looking at amazon target and a bunch of other sites this set was the best bargain and the highest quality i could afford and i could not be much happier with it the bottoms are heavy and not only retain heat but distribute it evenly i have only scorched one dish since getting the set and that was my fault not the cookware i will be adding other pieces from this line to my collection recommended,1
great i really love this pot it a bit larger than i expected but that my fault for not researching the size of pots properly i am just cooking for myself so NUMBER quarts is a bit more than needed regardless even when i cook small amounts of things the food does not burn or stick horrifically this pot conducts heat well and is nice and heavy bottomed it easy to clean and i would recommend this pot,1
for the price can not beat ths cookware i bought my first set NUMBER years ago and finally walked away from my big kettle and burned it dry sucks getting old the product has not changed in that time because its great,1
perfection i love these guys finally a comedy based on my generation and humor these guys are not afraid to put it out there or say whatever is on their minds if you like silly stupid raunchy then this show is for you,1
finding unworthy research to support questionable conclusions it widely reported that the religious right makes up a little less than NUMBER of the republican party not exactly a controlling majority to imply that they are driving all policy towards a theocracy is intellectually dishonest but works as a great scare tactic please look at some of the sources used in the research to say that they lack credibility would be an understatement air america etc but books that are preaching to the choir are a dime a dozen these days the author has his select audience and he trying to give him what they want to hear and shaping the research to support his conclusions there nothing wrong with that it sells books just do not expect many of the arguments to hold water,0
excellent this book is very well written and researched it is obvious that the negative reviewers on this site are the radical religious extremists that it is written about,1
wow even if you know a lot of this stuff it bracing to say the least to see it all presented at once it the kind of book that may permanently taint your view of the future and or get you to start making worst case scenario plans in the event that all the wheels come off at once especially interesting were the chapters on the history of mainstream and outsider churches in the us over the past two centuries definitely a neglected topic as the author points out and the southernization of america if mr phillips sterling credentials and decidedly non left orientation are not enough to convince you that this is not a biased one sided polemic you are probably unreachable,1
super awful it gets two stars for the unintentional comedy other than that it one of the worst of the ultra cheesy predictable low budget horror movies from the early nineties the fx are funny at first but then they just go on and on and on and the sucking takes over from the comedy the acting is uniformly terrible and one has to image that the typically enjoyable barrymore is just glad to have this ridiculous part of her career well behind her,0
poor quality i purchased this from renovaters supply in march NUMBER the rod itself is made of solid brass tubing which is why i purchased this however the wall of the tubing is made from incredibly thin brass and will bend if you hang a wet towel on it the chrome plating is also of poor quality for NUMBER you would think this would be top quality do not waste your money on this item,0
i have got the ice in me considering that enemymine is the work of zack sally danny sasaki and mike kunka you might wonder how a double bass one drummer band works the answer is heavy and quite well this ep contains my favorite song by enemymine i have got the ice in me however the ep is quite heavy and the sounds that kunka and sally create with their basses is incredible sadly like godheadsilo enemymine was not all that well known if you are interested in dead low tide or smoke and smoke give enemymine and godheadsilo a try,1
how not to write a book this is easily the greatest example any teacher professor could use in teaching how not to write a book it clearly a novel full of exaggeration distortion and in many places complete lies may god have had mercy when loraine tried explaining his part in his false witness crusade against the the church our NUMBER year old catholic church,0
eye opening it amazing how gullible some people can be i bought and read this book when i was evangelical i then began to examine the issues in it and seeing not only the inaccuracies and misrepresentations in this book but also seeing the historical theological and biblical cohesion of the claims of the catholic church i became catholic need i say more,0
rule NUMBER just because it published does not mean it true this one of the worst abominations ever put in print to describe catholicism it is of note only for its ludicrous claims half truths and outright lies do not be fooled this text is nothing more than run of the mill pitifully ignorant anti catholicism at its worst it has value only as an example of atrocious scholarship flagrant misrepresentation and outright bigotry,0
a codex of garbage this book is without question a codex of lies from someone who hates the catholic church the truly sad part is that some people actually eschew the bible in order to support boettner rancid work the book is useful for catholic apologists to understand the genesis of some of the more laughable arguments made against catholicism as a source of honest information it a sad joke a sad joke that still infects some of the more naive minds out there,0
outrageous pack of lies as a former protestant turned catholic i have done substantial research myself into the doctrinal basis of catholic church teaching and my conclusion this book is at best an example of poor scholarship but is probably more likely a deliberate attempt to spread anti catholic propaganda to unknowing protestants if you want the truth about catholic church doctrine better to read karl keating catholicism and fundamentalism or alan schreck catholic and christian if you are going to disagree with catholic church doctrine at least know what the actual doctrine is,0
no understanding of the catholic church the author displays a complete disregard for the teachings of the catholic church either pre vatican ii or post vatican ii and instead offers recycled stereotypical nonsense of catholicism offered by the same pseudo religious protestant preachers who seek to discredit the church one might actually gain a better knowledge of the catholic church by reading a the bibleb the catechism of the catholic church something that the author of this book has obviously not done,0
may god have mercy on you seriously wow what can i say totally ignorant very very poorly done or just plain intentional lies to mislead people even those people who do not have any faith affiliations and atheists will find this book beyond poorly researched i totally get it if one own or other christian denomination interpretation of the bible is different from roman catholism and her teachings but when people especially this book intentionally misrepresents fabricate lies that the other church truly teaches it borders bigotry and hatred which is against the NUMBER th commandment of god thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor please for humanity sake read a lot of good historical books specially the other side official teachings and not just from some disgruntled priest nun or unverifiable source and lastly be honest,0
a good fantasy mr boettner book has absolutely no basis in the real world i think it is safe to say there are factual errors on nearly every page and even when he does get it right he often distorts the facts catholics should read this just to see how far anti catholics will go,0
good idea that fails in implementation i originally was quite interested in seeing this film after reading a lot of good press about it when i finally did see the film theatrically i mainly saw little more than the failed possibilities in my opinion the greatest weakness is in focus the two founders are not particularly interesting characters and the choice to focus on them to the exclusion of the company itself brought the film down as well there are significant time gaps in the growth of govworks com while other sections most notably the rather boring part about securing venture capital are given a disproportionate share of the time in the end i never was able to care about the characters or gain any real feeling for the company they founded it could have been about any other business that failed with very little that was specific to the time place or culture that surrounded the dot com boom and why it went bust,0
uk to the fullest sway is amazing the album this is my demo is actually released through dyshpa productions which is sways company and he was in business with big allience records relesed in courtesy of all city music because sway is unsigned he has never had a record deal because what labels can offer him aint enough as to what he can do for himself i swear down check the website about this man bruv i swear to you you will be so disapointd in yourself if you do not get this brap safe,1
a wonderful story joel vance does a wonderful job of drawing you into his hunting life and painting a word picture that makes you feel like you are there he has an easy going writing style so it fun to ride along as he tells his tales there are times when you will laugh out loud and others when you will find good solid information about hunting guns or dogs,1
not good enough i like david and have seen him live the beginning of this book was pretty good but then i just lost interest there were the occasional laugh out loud sections but it seemed like they were not coming often enough to keep me choosing this book over others so i say it just was not good enough,0
made me feel icky i recently bought sedaris carnegie hall cd and thought it was hilarious i am also an enthusiastic fan of this american life and have loved his many contributions this book proves that npr highlights sedaris best work and leaves the rest unfortunately this is a book mostly of the rest i had a tough time finding any redeeming value in the story of his rickshaw hauling trash picking sister and her ability to put out cigarettes with her bare feet i was much more repulsed by the story of his budding homosexuality and the way he was able to coerce young naked boys to sit on his lap if i were to choose one word to describe this book it would be icky skip the ickiness and buy the cd or better yet skip the expense and listen to this american life it free and it his best material,0
a good buy for sedaris fans but mostly available elsewhere i love david sedaris i think his writing is very funny very touching and very entertaining i go to see sedaris speak when he on tour and i read short pieces he written for the new yorker and esquire online in fact i have already read many of the stories in this book which was somewhat disappointing rooster at the hitching post and several other have been printed elsewhere and you can read them online if you do not want to buy this book i will say though there are plenty of new stories in here that make the book well worth it just do not be too surprised if you come across something you have read before,1
something more serious if you enjoyed me talk pretty one day then you will like this book although it is a little more serious with personal stories from sedars struggles in life but it still has laugh out loud situations i listened to both books read by the author which made the stories feel even more personal,1
rolling on the floor in a fit of laughter being the first david sedaris book i have ever picked up i did not quite know what to think when i first checked it out from the library but after hearing it raved about by my friends and being highly allured by the cover i decided to give it a try reading this book turned out to be one of the most rewarding experiences i have had in a very long time i found myself cracking up at stories like six to eight black men baby einstein and monie changes everything i often laughed so hard i received very curious stares from those around me david sedaris is not only hilarious and entertaining but also a very talented writer who knows how to weave a story unlike any others i highly highly as highly as anyone can recommend this book for someone anyone who needs a good laugh,1
a literary reality show sedaris book is entirely too self aggrandizing to rate as entertainment spare yourself from the temptation to buy lamar nesbit,0
random rantings from a drugged homosexual the wittiest parts are in the first NUMBER chapters other than that do not bother this is the sad story of the product of a dysfunctional estranged family who has many opportunities through gifts trusts and other money sources to find his potential get an education and make his contribution to society instead through drugs homosexuality and extreme self absorbtion he descends into a sad wasted life i regret buying this book again do not bother,0
dress your family in corduroy and denim hearfelt essays on david sedaris life growing up gay in middle america always full of astute observations of american life you will laugh out loud many times while reading this collection of essays,1
good pan just hope you do not need the lifetime warranty good pan just hope you do not need the lifetime warranty this complaint is not pan specific if you have read the tons of consumer complaints against meyer corp you will see that they do not honor there lifetime warranty on the non stick surface i had my pan for NUMBER years and the surface stopped working we have never used the pan in the oven nor put it in the dish washer and we do not even own anything but plastic pan utensils all of which makes our pan a perfect candidate to be replaced according to the website you do not need an rma or anything just ups the pan well i did the ups tracking shows them getting it some NUMBER months ago and no word from them after checking around on line this is typical of them save your NUMBER in ups shipping and buy a different brand vote with your dollar and spend it else ware,0
farberware classic NUMBER inch frying pan i have used farberware for NUMBER years and have always loved their products most of my pots still look great after so much use they cook food beautifully the only problem has been with some of the handles loosening up after years of use they can usually be tightened with a screwdriver but after a long while it a bit more difficult,1
fantastic i sent this collection of italian cheeses to my daughter and needless to say she was delighted they were excellent formaggio del cucina italian cooking cheeses NUMBER pound by igourmet com,1
it did not help my vision i followed this book and did everything it said with an open mind the print is every bit as blurry as it every was before i tried the things in this book i wanted so much for this to work and i will try again but after four months of daily applying the techiniques of this book my vision did not improve the least bit,0
terrific album but what happened to NUMBER strong winds i saw the heart of gold concert from the ryman aud on showtime recently and found the music and staging superb neil sounded great and his asides between numbers showed how sensitive a performer he really is to those in his audience i immediately ordered the prarie winds cd as well as the dvd however i was disappointed that four strong winds was not included on the cd this is a beautiful song by ian tyson also found on cash v by johnny cash i would hope that neil version will eventually make it to a cd in the future i recommend both to all neil fans,1
great music terrible recording sound quality the recording is so bass heavy that it is not pleasurable to listen to the music on this cd is also on the live heart of gold dvd movie the sound quality is quite good on the live recording mr young performance of the songs is also better on the live recording,0
prairie wind review the cd does not play i have tried it in several different cd players and it simply does not play the johnny cash cd i purchased with it plays just fine so i do not know why it does not work i would appreciate a replacement,0
buy neil greatest hits insted i do not think this is neil young best cd i look at the radiobut the painter gets played like NUMBER NUMBER times on the radio a day why plus i have heard the songs are too slow this is too muchof an overrated cd buy the last album from neil young greatesthits it has better songs like his best down by the river andthe great grunge hey hey my my this is a waste of money,0
lost in stereotypes a decent book that could have been great homes novel came off underbaked too many implausible plot lines that are hastily tossed in incomplete cookie cutter characters and a seeming desire on the part of the author to recreate the los angeles of l a story sabotage an otherwise compelling story of a man who is trying to find his life again were this story focused on its characters more and their actual issues instead of attempting to impress readers with the flash and bang of its irrelevant events this would have been a much more interesting book even the book title suggests that homes did not have a clear grasp on the point of this novel and she spends NUMBER pages wandering around the desert trying to find it,0
if you like reading for the sake of reading ultimately this book is frustrating it drones on like our own mundane lives except the characters in the book are unbelievable everyone is an exaggeration too rich too full of themselves too over the top too self serving the conversations are all meaningless except maybe the one where richard son tells him how he feels about their relationship even the ending of the book is unresolved and open ended if you like reading for the sake of reading i recommend it if you are looking for inspiration to change your life do what the hero did walk out your door and open your eyes,0
misguided purchase the photo and description do not reflect the product the screen panel kit i received was white what a huge inconvenience during a time crunch,0
not as shown this product is shown in its picture setup with a top there is no top with this product and there are no supports or framework of any kind to set it up with what you get is a white folded cloth in a bag,0
no plot the story plot of this movie sucked it started going on a boat trip it ended going back on the same boat trip she was in this time still world that she kept re livin the question is why the movie did not give a reason what happened to make her go into this state it started in the time still state and ended the same way i will never watch this movie again i gave it one star because that is lowest grade i can go,0
b movie the movie was kind of low budget and more like a college film class movie project than anything some disconnects in it where the story did not make sense the overall concept was interesting using greek myth to drive the theme b movie when you are bored,0
ewwwww what the hell weird and beyond disturbing i had trouble figuring this one out did not care for this one at all,0
excellent no spoilers only this and holmes were grabbing my interest on the new video on demand releases i was afraid this was going to be a slasher flick i am so glad i picked i have not been this freaked out by a movie in a long time there truly some memorable scenes and one that gave me goose bumps towards the end superb directing the atmosphere was just fantastic melissa george really showed her acting potential here although i only have one other movie to compare to and i am like who are these other actors surely one of them is going to completely bring the movie down in some way absolutely not solid acting all around if you dig zone or just like freaky movies that make you think afterwards you can not go wrong with this gem,1
stealth movie a movie that sneaks up on you not a big budget but an excellent film and i like excellent films,1
do not waste your time the plot and acting for this movie are terrible the conclusion does not make any sense i watched this movie because of the positive reviews after watching the movie i wonder if the positive reviewers were paid to review this movie it is very frusterating to watch because the main character continues to make the same mistakes over and over again the ending brings no closure spoiler the beginning is the ending and the ending is the beginning i suppose the writer thought it would be witty but it is just a ridiculous plot,0
poorly researched this book is a must not read no one is perfect but a non fiction is no use if you can not trust the accuracy of the information in it in mistresses of mayhem ms hornberger makes mistakes so blatant that it calls the whole book into question one wonders if she did any research at all or just read up on the criminals on the court tv website she misnames countess elizabeth bathory the so called female dracula as bathroy no it is not a typo it is spelled that way all through the book in the famous diane downs case already well documented by ann rule in small sacrifices and made into a tv movie seen by many she misidentifies the daughter who died as christie who might be surprised by this since christie not only survived but testified against her mother cheryl is the daughter who died but hornberger describes cheryl as testifying at the trial simple proofreading could have corrected these mistakes good research would have made proofreading and this review unnecessary,0
very poor quality i am surprised at so many positive reviews the prose in this book is very poor quality it simplistic repeptitive and many times plain silly it reads like a quick amateur effort while i think that the autor is entitled to the right to fictionalize some characters or events i can not understand why her language is so dismal,0
trashy but quick and entertaining i wouldnt call this a literary masterpiece or the best book that i have ever read but i found it to be one of the most demanding that i go back to it and finish as soon as possible it one of those literary candy novels that you can not put down you will be up at night trying to find out who is sleeping with whom and killing whom next the amount of sex in the book without too much graphic detail is numbing afterwards it almost as mundane as brushing one teeth after reading hundreds of pages on the role that sex plays in politics weath class manipulation etc a harlequin story unbelievable society that tudor was so glad that women have it much better these days the pill did change history,1
could not put it down i bought this book as an assignment for my moms book club i could not put it down if my history books had been this interesting in high school i probably would have considered majoring in history in college gregory writing is absolutely delicious she enhances the historical facts with dialogue and really gives you a sense of how these characters lived and interacted now i am completely fascinated by historical novels another recommendation from my book club is abundance about marie antoinette even if you do not read it please know that marie is not the one who said let them eat cake that infamous quote was actually uttered by a man and incorrectly attributed to her she actually loved the french people anyway this novel is much better than the movie the other boleyn girl which i did see so if you saw the movie you should still read this book to really get the details of the story,1
the other boleyn girl this is one of the best pieces of historical fiction that i have read very hard to put down the story keeps you wondering what will happen next even when you know the historical ending a very enjoyable book to read,1
tawdry for a classier historical novel about the boleyns i recommend the lady in the tower by jean plaidy,0
scandle sex and fun i never really was all that interested in the whole henry viii thing but i was given this book and just started reading the first couple of pages it really has a way of engaging you from the start in the beginning mary is only a little girl involved in this larger than life role she has to play you follow her along with her exciting life and just when things start to cool off for her you become fixed on her sister i loved reading how nasty the author made her i know there are legends of how ann really was a royal pain the author did a good job playing it up it really is quite long over NUMBER pages but you would not know it i read it in NUMBER days its really a page turner it really only portrays ann and mary in depth and i liked that i also liked how the author depicts an aging baby of a king who likes to get his own way in the end the author does an amazing job wrapping up the looses ends to the already known facts making this history fiction story a great read,1
not worth the time first let me say that the purchasing end of this exchange was excellent the book reached me promptly and was in fine condition physically if only the writing were at least half as fine the conversations sounded NUMBER th century not remotely NUMBER th century nor did they sound like genuine exchanges among the boleyn siblings but instead like devices to let the reader know explicitly what was going on in the palaces and historically the author choice of starting with a wholly naive narrator mary in her early teens and increasing her knowledge and perceptiveness was not unwise in itself but was clulmsy in execution she seems altogether too dense for too long and even after she much more worldly still frequently demonstrates her cotton head there no denying that the tudor era was racy and dangerous if this is the only book at hand on that subject grab it and skim,0
makes you want to keep reading on a wonderfully written book that gives insight into a siginificant time in history with a very personnel look,1
easy reading book is very different than the movie it more indept i enjoyed it would recommend to fans of the tudor age,1
loved this book i loved this book i seen the movie and have to say the book is so much better i finished reading it then started reading it all over again this was the first book i have read about henry viii and its inspired me to want to know everything i can about that time now i own over NUMBER books about tudor history i want to read everything i can get my hands on and i never bore of it and to think i owe it all to this book it from mary boleyn point of view you will see her challanges as well as anne and the rest of their family you will feel like your right there at court with them it an exciting and fearful time at the court of henry viii it is also very accurate and i highly recommend it its one of phillippa greggory better books i have read all her books and this one is by far her best work you will fall in love with the tudor era if your not already,1
history brought to life this book first and foremost brings to life the pure beauty of britain the old houses wildlife and its rather bizarre history and has made me very proud of where i come from the other boleyn girl is extremely readable and tells of the rise and fall of the boleyn family i have never been much of a person for history but this book certainly interested me and went beyond anything i could have learnt in history class i recommend this book without really saying why for fear of ruining parts but coming from a history know nothing i say it is definitely worth a read if you want to know about the greed of one man and the unstoppable ambition of one tragic family,1
i already knew the story i have to admit i usually do not like historical fiction this book was no exception i read half and read the end because it was boring,0
historical fiction overdone with an emphasis on the fiction part this could have been a really good novel but it fell way short i guess i just prefer historical fiction to be well historical,0
finally finished it i liked how it started with the beheading of a relative and details of court life were interesting at the beginning but became tedious with the repetitiveness this book really could have been half or one third the size it drug on and on and on getting to the end was a relief i doubt i will read another book by this author,0
a novel for the intellectually challenged anyone who treasures good historical fiction will after reading or trying to read the other boleyn girl see at once that they stumbled upon what we once called a dime novel that pejorative characterizing hack writing which in our time is seen most often in historical romances novels peopled with superficial modern characters costumed in period dress the other boleyn girl is such a novel in our time of computers the internet and blogs the dime novel has been given new life through heavy promotion and phony critiques it a world where lies flourish and publications such as publishers weekly with their fatuous critiques become co conspirators in this deception,0
other boleyn girl a future lifetime movie for certain the hallmarks are all there the air of virtue and innocence the first love quickly disillusioned jealousy backbiting a second romance that proves to be the reason for living yes we will someday see some actress playing mary boleyn on the lifetime channel in the other boleyn girl that all this novel is fit for mary boleyn is the most bovine heroine i have ever encountered and philippa gregory writing never gets above the weepie of the week level the boleyns are a fascinating subject for fiction they are not served well or made interesting by gregory book,0
one of the best books i have ever read this book is a wonderfully and thrillingly written account of the machinations of the boleyn family to get close to the throne at the times of henry viii mary boleyn is ordered by her family to be at king henry command whatever his wishes and whims she obeys her family since she is barely NUMBER when first presented to the king she succeeds in keeping him at her side for a while until his eyes begin to wander again and he seeks fulfilment in every way elsewhere all of a sudden she is commanded to stand back and let her sister anne bathe in the king glory in my opionion mary was quite helpless whereas her sister anne is portrayed as a scheming whore the author has a fabulous way with words and if you are interested in english history written at a wonderful pace as well as a thrilling account in other words you will probably be utterly competely totally unable to put this book down once you have started this is a book you simply can not miss,1
very enjoyable just finished and i could go back and read it again ms gregory truly the era history and nuances of court life and brings to life how it affects each character,1
a can not put down book it one of the greatest books i have ever read it beautifully written gregory finds a great balance of description not to much not to little she has this great ability to make the reader feel as he were in that space and time i also found that the author leaves you with the feeling of wanting to find out more which i find great i finished this book last night NUMBER am could not stop reading and first thing in the morning i was at the bookstore looking for more books on the topic i am going to start the secret diary of anne boleyn i hope it as good as this one do not miss this great read,1
a fast read i breezed through this book and i found it a great read i had a hard time with some of the stuff like being married at twelve and the beheading however i enjoyed the view point from so long ago and how very difficult women had it i have leant this book out and have not gotten it back,1
when movies were more fun i had recorded this movie originally off of tv years ago it is in my opinion one of the classics and it brought back plenty of memories what i really appreciated with this dvd is that it included the viewer to watch the film at it was originally intented it definitely worth the price of admission,1
NUMBER ghosts review i saw the newer version a couple years ago and never knew that it was a remake then i found out that martin milner was in it and i knew i had to see it this was your typical old black and white movie with the typical dialogue that you would think but i thought this movie was really funny i know it not supposed to be but oh well different times during the movie the background would change to blue and then ghosts would appear in red the problem that i did not realize when i bought this movie was that you need those NUMBER d glasses to view the ghosts without straining your eyes i really liked this movie it wasnt as scary as the recent one but it was a good horror movie for the NUMBER,1
disappointed i have bought two copies of this movie on dvd and each one was missing the ghost viewers buyer beware if you buy this dvd you may get what you pay for or you may not,0
good idea poor implementation poor quality product great idea my daughter was super excited to get this one but flash light broke right away binoculars are not strong at all thermometer on the whistle does not reflect outside temp re properly very disappointing purchase,0
a very pretty decoration for all and fun for children the lovely watercolor print shows a pond skating scene full of holly pond hill bunnies in their victorian costumes very sweet there is a little flap to open for each day of the advent season with a cute little surprise inside it will stand upright on a table or under your tree it can be stored for use in years to come i am looking forward to starting an advent calendar tradition with my toddler this year she will really enjoy those cute bunnies,1
flawless worked perfectly from the start simple clean no hassle pay close attention to instructions regarding using pump to stimulate ink flow and avoid refilling a cartridge which has been empty for some time it has dried up and may not refill properly also as another reviewer mentioned the calibration marks on the ink tank serve as an excellent guide to monitor how much ink has gone into the cartridge construction quality is very precise much better than i would have expected for a product of this nature this product will save huge dollars over feeding hp their profit gouging prices for oem hooray,1
clear and concise but requires supplementation griffiths qm text provides excellent problems and a coherent though somewhat cryptic development of the theory he has a conversational style also evident in his em text that elucidates many of the hard to visualize concepts in qm however he relies on the use of many specialized techniques to solve problems if the student is unfamiliar with the mathematical tricks involved it leads to frustration i recommend griffiths text as the main book in a qm course only if it is supplemented with additional hints from the professor on the problems or with an additional text such as shankar or the eisberg and resnick work,1
not just for breast feeding moms three words buy a boppy its not just for breastfeeding moms though i can definately see how it would be a great asset for those who choose to breastfeed i have used it during feedings to take some strain off my arm because baby can get heavy to hold in an upright position that is best for bottle feeding i have also used it to prop my baby up in a sitting position and she loves it she looks so comfortable i almost wish they made adult size boppys i have also put it around my waist and yes it does bring back prego memories and layed the baby in it so she can snuggle close to me while my hands are free to do other things read change the channel etc a great buy for every parent,1
photographers helper i do not have children yet but my profession is a photographer and with infants so little it sometimes hard to get them in a perfect pose the boppy is a great tool to get a natural look you can cover it with a blanket to match whatever you want so next time you go to get those special memories captured bring along your boppy and introduce your favorite photographer to the boppy i also prop it up a little if they are on a table and the camera is fixed ie jcpenney or sears congrats to all and many smiles,1
awesome product i love this i am a first time mom who breast feeds my baby and i found this to be such a life saver my son is NUMBER months now and we still use it almost every feeding it saves your arm and neck from feeling strained and holds the baby at just the right level for nursing i highly recommend this product to any mother,1
do not really get it not useful for us at all i breastfed my daughter until she was a year old and found the boppy to be pretty much useless it was not the right height for nursing for me and i preferred to use a smaller pillow which conformed to my daughter body better we used it once or twice for sitting up but most of the time she was supported by my legs or multiple pillows i think this is one of those products that either love hate for us it has to be the latter,0
recalled boppy i went to target today to purchase this boppy apparently it has been recalled and they took all the other ones off the shelf i do not know why it has been recalled yet but i wanted to warn the amazon buyers first,0
wait to buy i urge mothers to wait to purchase the boppy i was sold by all the rave reviews bought the pillow and never used it i had an NUMBER lbs NUMBER oz baby boy and found it difficult to nurse him with it it got in the way now it just sits in a corner i guess i will use it when he learning to sit up to prop him up with i urge mothers to borrow one first to see if they like it before spending the,0
a great product we got this to support our arms while bottle feeding though it seems to be known for breastfeeding it is helpful to us bottle feeders as well the unique shape is great because it can be turned to be comfortable for different sized people and different height chairs also our NUMBER week old loves to lie in it it keeps him snuggled and supported and it gives our arms a break now and then the pillow is so soft that sometimes when i snuggle with him in it that both of us take a little nap it is a bit pricy that why it NUMBER stars and not NUMBER but it makes a great gift,1
great for taking pretty photos this boppy was very helpful in feeding my daughter during the early weeks of life it also helped with laying her down when she was in the phase of waking up everytime you put her down i would nurse her and then transfer her to the bed on the pillow then remove the pillow but most of all i loved taking photos of my daughter with the clouds as the backround it makes some of the most beautiful pictures when they are small and can not do much,1
roses are reds violets are blue this movie is recommended for you a warm and rather lighthearted movie that is pleasing to most tastes and obviously uplifting to the vast majority of reviewers here at amazon not a whole lot of character development throughout the movie but the characters are rather endearing nonetheless some will be skeptical as to the plausibility of such a prison set up but it was refreshing to see an approach to incarceration that offers some real rehabilitation and redemption,1
this was so funny i saw this movie at a preview screening in l a and i thought it was amazing it was such a cute original story and all the actors were great clive owen who was in croupier last year was especially good he is going to be a big star this is a movie for everyone who loved saving grace and waking ned devine,1
definitely a disappointment i had a hard time finishing this book not enough adventure for me i was actually glad when i finally reached the end i kept thinking the storyline might improve but to no avail definitely a disappointment,0
sordid book while golding is correct in that there is a dark side to human nature he is a fool for having created such an implausible plot boys of that age rarely attack people under any circumstances instaed they use more subtle forms of psychological warfare they could only have acted like that if they had had to eat each other to survive to expect boys to shrug off social conditioning in such a short time is however absurd,0
how can you like this this book had good morals but it was so confusing that to even understand one of the main points in the book i needed cliffs notes some of it was exciting inside the chapter but i can not remember one cliffhanger chapter ending trust me if you are a teen take it from another unless forced to read this for school like i was do not read this book it isnt worth your effort to read such a terrible book whoever called it a classic is crazy,0
golding at his greatest golding certainly seems to root out the very psychology that lays behind the rudimentary world of the male youth in magnificently eloquent prose and a deeply engrossing story to boot lord of the flies has deservedly been dubbed a modern classic one can relate to the actions of the characters simply because we were all once of that age and were all once driven by the same urges impulses and emotions that golding so graphically and yet so effectively illustrates an essential read there can be no doubt,1
authority i believe that the author purpose in the the lord of the flies was to show that without laws there would be chaos in the world to show that authority is trully needed in the world i agree one hundred percent with this message because there is a need for consequences for people who refuse to listen to authority the literary element that golding handled the best was symbolism for example the conch was a symbol of authority and power when the conch was broken there was no authority but complete chaos this book is believeable because it is possible to get stranded on an island and it is possible for people to become mean and spiteful the only bad thing about the book was some of the words were hard to understand if i had written the book i would not have used such large discriptive words but the lord of the flies was a good book and i would recommend it to my friends or anyone looking for a good book to read,1
all in all a good book well written but definately not my cup of tea high reccomendations for those who enjoy this type of literature,1
a must read the noval lord of the flies written by william golding is one of the most complex books i have ever read i love how this book makes you think and relate situations and characters to those in your own life at first glance this noval may seem like its not worth reading but do not judge a book by its cover the only reason i gave this book a NUMBER instead of NUMBER is that it diddnt seem very realistic for example the boys age i did not think they were old enogh to even really comprehend what they had done also there seemed to be no remorse for death but that is easily forgotton because of the intensity of this great book not only is this book entertaining and colorful but its also got a not so easily seen message but through symbolism and getting to know the characters you will find that this book makes you see your society and yourself in a whole new way,1
weird i had to read this book for literiture class i hated it my teacher rattled on about the symbolizm in this book it was so boring and kinda gory plus no girls wasnt they susposed to repopulate the world after nuclear war so not possible wih only boys the one thing i found interesting was how they acted like wild animals after they had been on the island a while that was kinda cool but it was to confusing,0
not the best novel well i have read this in NUMBER th grade i really do not think of it as a great novel i have read better it depends on what your taste in novels are i suppose i know that this is not a good review on this novel and i am sorry if this misleads you well i suggest to read it before you decide whether or not you like it,0
you sure you want to read this this book is not for a rainy day rainy day are depressing and exploring the dark side of the human soul is no less if you are into dreams leave this book on the shelf if you want to feel like puking from the pit of stomach at the depts of human depravity this is the book for you one sentence to describe this book a daring expose of the cruelty of children and a slap on the wrist of anybody who thinks kids do not need discipline,1
most disappointed well how can i review this product when it still have not arrived it has apparently been resent but once again has not arrived very disappointed,0
an unbelievable waste of time as a response to one of the reviews that speaks quite highly of this novel i would like to say that despite my understanding and comprehension of the book i still found it entirely dull boring and a waste of my time since it was required of me to read this book in school i was forced to make my way through each dragging chapter but i would have never on my own time and it not because i did not understand the book that i feel this way about it my class discussed quite thouroughly about the book symbolism which was golding intention to start out with despite its hidden meanings the novel still remains absolutely ridiculous in the sense that these young british boys turn completely salvage and kill their fellow islanders if the book was looked at through a totally symbolic perspective it would make more sense but in order to understand its symbolism one still has to read it and it is really not worth it,0
thumbs down god this was terrible a group of children are marooned on a deserted island and must survive on their own we see the rise and fall of their society as order is achieved power corrupts the strongest of the group and the weakest members are dismissed or destroyed and finally chaos rules despite my dislike of this book i will admit it is a very true commentary on society the powerful abuse those weaker than them how quickly rules become obsolete when they become inconvenient the set roles of people in society the chubby guy with glasses can never be as powerful as the cool good looking guy if you are not being forced to read this for school please do not do it the simpsons parody of it is also a good thing to watch at least in a cartoon it is entertaining with just as much commentary on society as the original,0
it a good book but not my favorite golding was trying to say that there is evil in everyone i do agree on this theme becuase i do not think everyone is good i believe everyone does something that is evil although some people have it in them more than others i think the author used a lot of description which made it really boring he also used too much violence which in my opinion only made it worse i think this can happen to anyone who is in a plane crash being in this situatuion can get your mind crazy and make you do weird things like the boys did if it was me who wrote the book i would use less description becuase is made it boring i would also make it less vioent,0
the lord of the flies is a great book the llord of the flies is a great book it is a book that should be used in every school because is shows a great struggle for survival on a deserted island with basicly nothing,1
great book but the author reading is terrible i love this book but i was not halfway through the introduction when i realized how painful it would be to have the author read it to me he sighs and breathes heavy in the middle of sentences speaks in a monotone voice and makes all the characters sound the same which makes it hard to tell who is saying what during the book argument scenes overall great story that deserved a professional voice actor to read it somebody who could have made the story come alive any nuance the author could have added through his own insight into the story was lost in the lackluster presentation,0
it is worse than reading the dictionary it was so boring i had to induce ain to stay awake while reading i,0
yow lots of people wrote stuff huh this book stunk i believe that reality can have deeper meanings but do not get to deep or you will drown the only time you can go that deep and not drown is with drugs i never thought lord of the flies would attract so many druggies,0
disgusted i was disgusted by the grotesque display of savagery in this novel i found it lacking purpose and realism all i found in this novel is one man sick views of humanity i do not reccomend this novel to anyone especially children,0
innate savagery even though it been years since i first encountered this novel i still vividly recall the brave leadership of ralph the understanding innocence of piggy the thrill of the hunt the smell of the pigs blood and the intense primitive nature that takes dominion over the boys the exploration of the various social interactions and the influence human nature has on them is intriguing and well delineated however the internal savagery that slowly and universally reveals itself amongst the characters proves to be the trues force which holds this novel high in my regard truly captivating and dangerously luring,1
boring i would not reccomend this book it was very boring and i did not find much of a purpose the end was the best part but it was still bad l did not get into this book or enjoy it it was for school,0
i do not like the book i am a fan of classic literature but this book was just too slow for me everyone should read it because it a classic but i did not enjoy it,0
a brilliant achievement symbolism beyond comparison this is my favorite book yet and by the way i have read quite a few not only is the symbolism masterful but the book is thoroughly interesting and captivating as well i am shocked at some of the criticisms of this work of such epic proportions i honestly can not figure how anyone could find fault with it i understand that it not the most enjoyable of experiences to read books for school but this one is not one of the boring kind the book is beautifully written and golding use of metaphor allegory and personification is consummate golding pulls all he can into this book details from all walks of life the book is incredible as there is a vibrantly suspenseful surface story with ingenious characters and plot as well as richly deep undertones of life and the depths of human heart and consciousness all you have to do is read it,1
great classic book this book came on time and was in good condition it has been on my list of books to read for a very long time,1
a fairly simple story with deep meaning lotf is a short and simple novel with a deep subject matter golding tries to convey his beliefs in the innate evil in individual humanity through a story wrought with simplicity golding does a great job in developing the characters of lotf the characters unlike the NUMBER movie are quite believable each of the main characters have their own personality and are utilized by golding to symbolize his ideas golding uses a lot of imagery and symbolism but he does this in a manner that is easy to understand his writing style is simple and clear and without all of the complex language that can bog down a good novel this story flows at a nice pace and never seems to drag on i enjoyed this novel underneath the symbolism there was a fast moving suspenseful story and golding did a good job in making the reader of this novel contemplate the nature of man and society it well worth the read,1
no wonder they call it the lord of the flies this book stunk my favorite chapter in this book would definitely be the first chapter when the kids are introduced on the island there was this one kid that everyone had called piggy to me that is the funniest thing in the world i do not know why but the humiliation of another kid is extremely hilarious it may seem cruel but to me it funny i would have to say that this book was definitely for the older more mature kids like high school kids all in all i would have to say that even with the kid getting humiliated i dislike this book with a passion it is way to boring and just when you think it going to get good the book disappoints you and i do not think that is a very good book for the serious reader,0
a conventional view of mankind this book exists to support the author opinion that man is brutish and destructive this was written well before clinical studies of violance child abuse the effects of peer pressure etc it reflects the basic christain view that man is vile itis obvious that golding never considers that by the time any of these boys has spent time in their families and then in the prep school any natural impulse has been thoroughly ground out bysocial standards these boys are as affected by all they psychological influences as adults with fewer methods to deal with them of course they revert to so called savagery it what they experienced at their school of course there are no intelligent responses we are not trained to use intelligent response the book is a polemic of the conservative christian man is vile and must be controlled or he will become a savage nurture has no place i find it a completely annoying book presenting an unrealistic result,0
took too long it great ordering a book and the book was good but the delivery took so long that i had to go to the bookstore and get it for my daughters class anyway so it was really a waste should not take over two weeks to get a book,0
may be a classic but not as good as people think i was required to read this book for school in my honors english class NUMBER th grade i found it very hard to follow and too symbolic this is the book of dreams for any english teacher who loves to get their students to read between the lines personally i enjoy a book that is a challenging read but in this book every little detail meant something deeper and it gave me a headache trying to interpret the aspect of society the detail was trying to depict i understood the book but it was not enjoyable for me and if it were not a required reading i would not have read the book otherwise but if you like books to give you a headache then this is perfect for you,0
lord of the flies was creative but lost our attention we think that the book lord of the flies was just it was an intense way of looking at a goodlife we believe that the message of the novel was always have hope we thought it could have ended better but it pulled it all together well although we were bored at times we liked the way golding had items symbolize ideas the book was different then ones we have read in the past therefore it broadened our views of good versus evil,0
a great book on so many levels i first read this book at a young age i enjoyed it very greatly then not as an allagory for anything or as anything of that sort but as a story of adventure and survival recently i have read it with my english class and explored the symbolism and allegories i think that the lord of the flies is a very strong book with a strong message that can be understood at many levels and i think that this is a book that ever family that enjoys reading should own the lord of the flies can be enjoyed and reread by people of all ages and spending an hour to read up on the symbolism in this book is well worth it as it enriches the story alot and provides a whole new meaning to the book NUMBER NUMBER for a great read for all ages,1
shocking i loved this book it explores social interactions between young males and the limits of the conscience the ending was shocking be prepared for an exciting story this is middle school reading,1
novel review of the lord of the flies the lord of the flies by william golding was not as good as i thought it was going to be i thought that the idea of the book was very good and the theme was well thought out but i do not think it was well written some parts could have been better but it was interesting somethings i disliked were that there were only boys on the island and no girls if there were girls i think the story would have been different i also did not like how piggy died i think the book would have had a better ending if piggy stayed alive some things that i liked about the book were most of it was realistic the schoolboys made rules for themselves and there became two sides i liked how the characters were described and how the meanings of their names mathed their actual names,0
nice book i think it was a good book because the story was very interesting and easy to read the message of the novel is very important important because it relates to ancient times morden times and the future you must read this book,1
adventouros story good plot and fantastic characters this is a book for every teen to read it gives the feelng of pride and intense excitment,1
thought provoking creepy depressing and intuitive i read this book two years ago for a grade NUMBER english class and have not had the chance to reread it but i do remember it well the premise is not especially exciting initially but it becomes a living parable of terror i find it interesting that the author used boys as his subjects rather than little girls or both but would this have changed the outcome that is something you must decide for yourself also when finally saved the naval officer is confused as to what the boys are doing exactly and yet ralph knows exactly perhaps children are not as intellectually inferior as we are assumed to be though chilling i highly recommend this book as it gives a startling clear view of broken society it pessimistic but perhaps all too realistic,1
everyone should read this novel this is one of those novels that everyone should read through isolation on a remotes island we get to glimpse the life of these young boys and how chaos takes over their uncivilized new world the refelection on human nature may be frightening but it is riveting and honest lord of the flies is a short and easy read and it should not be missed i highly recommend this novel,1
the what ol days i can not say enough about this book there is so much depth in it and so much ot think about there more than just an innocence lost thing in it like the choir leader jack becoming the most evil on the island i think golding meant to imply that innocence is an illusion as shallow as the choir boys outfits being a substitute teacher for both high school and middle school i would vouch golding implications hold true even for kids who are not lost on desserted islands ultimately the island signifies a pre adolescent experience as being cut off from the world while admist a wild sway of new emotions i am glad this book exists because peopel need access to eloquent articulation of youth experiences,1
a girlie book with lots of blood friends who know i m interested in war history recommended this book but this is not war history this is a rather banal love story mixed up with a lot of bloody details if you are looking for the real stuff go somewhere else,0
disappointing outdated and not useful this book was written in NUMBER technically speaking it completely out of date my major criticism though is the low value of the content do we really need to be taught that soft or pastel colors appeal more to women not only is that kind of thinking outdated but who needs to read a book with that level of information,0
they cut the extras i dunno about the stand alone blu ray but the dvd of otis has a ton of great extras commentary deleted alternate scenes ending featurette trailers etc this version however has no extras whatsoever i thought the point of blu ray was being able to jam more on the disc while maintaining superior picture quality on the plus side dr giggles has never looked better and this seems to be the only blu ray release of that film though it weird that they have paired it with a completely unrelated movie made nearly NUMBER years later if you are only interested in the films themselves you can not beat the price but the lack of extras is irksome,0
extremely poor continuation i am a big jane austen fan and i love to read the continuations and sequels however i had trouble finishing this book the break in the writing between austen original text and the addition is glaring the style changes the characters change the plot leaps wildly it almost like two books the author should not have bothered keeping the original text she probably would have done better rewritting it to fit her own style i highly recommend reading the other sanditon continuation by anne telscombe instead it does a seamless job of continuing and the characters stay in character,0
very dull and witless this was a dull read that i had to force myself to finish the plot wanders aimlessly and is hard to follow mnay of the other continuations are better than this so i would recommend saving your money,0
not for kids under NUMBER years old while the finished product a working phone with see through cover and flashing lights is great this toy is definitely not easy to assemble it took a bright NUMBER year old her NUMBER year old aunt and the child grandfather well versed in electronics two hours or more to finally get all the pieces in place the parts seem to be well made and the phone really does work but the directions are very difficult to understand and there was no explanation whatsoever of how a phone works in short what was supposed to be a fun learning experience turned out to be an exercise in frustration this kit is probably best suited for teenagers or adults who already have some background in electronics,0
compact phono portable and plays NUMBER rpms this battery operated little jewel allows playing of old NUMBER and stillsounds reasonable in it single onboard speaker mode it also has thestandard stereo outputs to drive an external soound system for all threerpms all this and it built to pack around my wife called it one of the best electronics purchases i have ever made,1
a great varied album techno house ambient dance electronica whatever you want to call it everything is wrong is just great music by a great artist it has everything a fan of pop music could want,1
the favorite book in our house we love reading this book to our six month old it has a rhythm to it that makes it so much fun the illustrations are adorable and the story line is very creative the cardboard books are best for a young baby who likes to turn the pages too i give this book as gifts all the time,1
very concerned about the einstein syndrome first of all i am quite offended by this author i am a licensed speech language pathologist with NUMBER years of experience in the public school system i am currently working as a special education coordinator in heaven forbid a public school system i read about children and their issues concerns characteristics continuously this book was recommended by a parent and i was very excited to read it i was not prepared for the assault on speech language pathologists and others in the public schools of america i truly wish the author would do a more thorough investigation of our credentials and our job performances we are not in the business of creating business believe me we have plenty to keep us busy we are however very dedicated to children and their needs whether that involves einstein type children asperger autistic hyperlexic attention deficit disordered gifted or any of the multitude of diagnoses,0
einstein syndrome bright children who talk late if you have a child that is late with speech development seems frustrated with communications strong willed defiant prone to tantrums good at solving puzzles loving but sometimes aloof concentrates on some tasks ignores requests to perform other tasks not the least interested in potty training exhibiting some autistic or pdd tendancies but having exceptional memory and suprising intelligence then you need to get this book do not be put off by reviews of the professionals the book has some information that will help concerned parents bypass those professional egos and cut to the main issue how to best understand and help your child,1
how to go to college almost for free i bought this for my grandson he has already written in for several grants and working on more this is a great gift for any high school kid and even kids in college i do not believe the parents should go into debet for this the kids will do much better if they have to work for it i have seen to many parents almost go broke with several kids at college at the same time they end up with nothing for retirement believe me you need a nest egg take if from a grandma that has a great pension,1
cool book i am not much for writing book reviews but this book was so good that i decided to do so anyway the author has really done a comprehensive treatment of the subject of college scholarships this is the scholarship book to get,1
how to go to college for almost free this book is very informative ben kaplan manages to convey the information in a fun and lighthearted manner this is a great book for parents and students alike,1
the academic types love it i guess it makes one feel intellectually in touch if he can praise this book i guess i will never make it to that level because i think this is one terrible book i read approximately NUMBER pages on the traits of fox edwards therefore i was a little upset when i found out it was for no reason i read with interest the last few pages where i found out that wolfe editor had to piece together several parts of this book and then he had to write many pages in order to tie this mess together all of this occured after wolfe death i believe this is a collection of ramblings from thomas wolfe i am sure that i can be attacked verbally for not understanding the meaning of this great work but if it was truly a great work i would not have missed its significance please play with the kids walk around the block start drinking but do not waste your time on this book,0
the great american literary genius of the NUMBER th century let us see now have you bought in to the powerpoint bullet ed concise notion of literature i e stupid undeveloped soul less notion of expressing what it is to be human in that case you will find the works of thomas wolfe as you find the works of marcel proust or thomas mann a great big bore otherwise you will not find them a bore but the very opposite of a bore a source of inspiration of joy of excitement of the quintessence of life,1
orson welles and magic i have always been a fan of orson welles on radio and television having collected a ton of radio broadcasts on cd and audio cassette and having watched most of his movies i appreciate the genius of his work i picked up a copy of this book recently and am amazed at the amount of research put into it an aspect of welles rarely discussed is his magic career at the mid atlantic nostalgia convention this september in aberdeen maryland i plan to attend the presentation about orson welles and his magic career so i can watch rare footage and films with welles and get an even deeper insight to his trickery book comes recommended,1
used it for years we have used this product for many years it cleans stainless steel coffee pots perfectly they shine better than they did when new,1
poor service from home and beyond i still have not receivied what i ordered and paid for they claim the first shippemnt was damaged and have yet to ship a replacement three phone calls were not returned from them the vendor is very slow to resolve the problem they said it would be here last week now it is this week i have no confidence that they will ever deliver the product,0
vapid and vacuous the main character was insufferable parker has tried to create a male spencer but fails miserably she appears to be without fault and has an answer for everything at least spencer admits to feet of clay the plot was implausible,0
dumber dumber yeah same wisecracking dialogue sidekicks and relationship quandaries as the spenser novels realized the plot was familiar a few chapters in lifted from previous early spencer novel characterizations inconsistent and contrived if not absurd a lot of villainous stereotypes and the plot point that the whole story is based on is ludicrous there are much better written guilty pleasures than this one some by the same author,0
parker new charge being a huge spenser fan i am of course a robert b parker fan sunny randall makes her debut in this yarn of sex deceit and extortion not his best but getting his feet wet with this new female perspective he makes more than a solid effort he gets the ball rolling in following tales i am grateful to mr parker and his pen figuratively if you are a fan do not miss it if you are not why not,1
hard rock meets ambient listening to the song right now compels me to write this review if nothing buy this cd only for this track a NUMBER minute long epic ambient composition showcases the genius that moby is there are several other very good songs on this album this album is predominantly hard punk rock with some softer ambient pieces sparsed in between most people know moby for his work on techno and ambient music but here moby shows his versatility by doing an equally good job with hard rock many of the songs have him screaming at the top of his voice but rest assured they are still good and not average hard punk rock music again moby shows that he does not go by what sells rather he goes by his artistic instinct and likes to experiment with different genres of music most of moby works are highly underrated and misunderstood this is one of them moby music is intelligent music unfortunately not many people can understand or appreciate that,1
awesome series the autumn series its just amazing i first bought them in ebooks but it was so good that i had to buy the complete series in paperback it amazing how after so many books the author keeps you in suspense and does not get boring this moody guy it really gifted,1
gsm phones alot of stuff for nokia is gsm only pull off your battery and take a look at your nokia phone the older phones that alot of people carry is tdma cdma like the NUMBER guess what it dose not work,0
excellent reading this is the best book i have ever read on jesus other than the bible this man was very knowledgeable about his subject he was also very familiar with his subject jesus as you will see when you read this book no christian should be without this book in his library,1
typos galore i do not intend to review content here this new edition is so full of typographical errors that sometimes the reader will have to intuit what the author really wrote it is clear that the proofreaders of this edition were not actually reading they were simply following the little red lines under the misspelled words this has resulted in some truly bizarre apparent statements by the author unreproducible here due to copyright laws disclaimer i have not purchased this book merely checked it out of the library,1
overrated this book is overrated by a longshot if i did not know any better i could swear that this book was not even edited turtledove has NUMBER things going on at once there are too many characters and too little continuity i would recommend this book to anyone who has insomnia,0
very slow turtledove certainly has a good grasp of history but the quality of his writing is only so so when you combine this with a very long plot development and stereotypical characters it is almost impossible to finish one volume let alone all four an editor would have been useful but perhaps the publisher figured enough people would keep paying for the whole series that no editing was needed,0
fresh and exciting when i first heard the cd i was a bit shocked these musicians really have a unique way of playing these pieces i am quite used to period performances of romantic music but this feels really unique the more i listen i start to appreciate and understand the point in using the playing style that they do i realize that this is very close to the way it ones sounded and that is very exciting i think the lack of constant vibrato and the glissandos that are frequently used creates a completely new atmosphere which i think is very suitable for this music i really recommend this disc and believe that the eroica quartet has a bright future ahead of itself and that what they do today will shape the sound of tommorow,1
great for the beginner the experienced and the want to be this is one of the few dog books i own that i would gladly spend money on again i especially appreciate their section on selecting a dog specifically for the sport since most of us skijor with our pets they make a point of emphasising what you want to live with NUMBER days a year they also have a great section on training for races my only hope is that they will have a new edition out someday including training details for distance skijoring which is bound to be a growing segment of the sport,1
great product i took a chance ordering this product because there were not many reviews i am glad i did i got it a few days ago connecting my pc to my tv went fine basicaly my tv serves as a second pc monitor now and after adjusting the screen resolution the image was perfect very little fuzzyness the quality of the videos i played was very good and well transfered to the tv the cables are not super long something to think about if your pc and tv are far apart a good choice and i will update in a few weeks months to say how it holds up,1
a definite page turner this was an excellent story about world war ii three friends who share quality time at sakkara on an archeological expedition are seperated by the war harry waever is in military intelligence for the united states his other two friends jack halder and rachel stern are at work for the nazis they are setting up a german plan to assasinate roosevelt and churchill in egypt it is up to weaver to stop them they are of course reunited this excellent book has many surprises as well as manytwists and turns the book will definitely leave you wondering what if be sure to read this book you will not be dissapointed,1
enthralling my son and i started reading parts of this in the car on a trip we are both aficionados of anything mythological and encountering these profound rich and unusual stories has been inspiring to both of us but probably most inspiring to my son the stories we have read so far are presented both as myths but also as possibilities expanding the idea of what might have been and what might be offering also a window of insight into the times in which the myths were captured the myths are largely framed within the context of the christian and roman catholic church and culture and do reveal some of the bias of the times against the jews and judaic faith while not politically correct this is a solid well written work with much education potential if placed in context and not read as a sole work on the topic one of the best free books i have gotten for the kindle,1
great book the worst print quality you will ever seen the book delivered by amazon com looks like a photocopied book not a printed one paper quality is the worst it totally incompatible with the us NUMBER price it should be out of print or something and then prentice hall found it cheaper to photocopy and bind it rather then issuing a new edition amazon com should let customers know this in advance the book content is great as the other reviewers have said but i am about to see a book with worse print quality than the one amazon sent me i wish i have bought a used book printed NUMBER years ago for us NUMBER,0
not good i tried to read it it was just so boring and bad his other books are good this book is not,0
bad video james earl jones butchers the narration of this presentation he was far worse on the actual broadcast this has been slightly edited and the actors portraying clay shaw and david ferrie are horrible this show was a classic example of the overkill that came after jfk came out in late NUMBER everything good bad and ugly came out in book and tv form this is one of the ugly moments vince palamara,0
good packaging no mushrooms while this mushroom kit arrived in good packaging and looked ready to go i was not able to get it to produce mushrooms i followed the instructions keeping it moist and at the cooler temperatures but nothing ever happened i also tried oyster mushrooms a few weeks prior to that and got huge crops of those so i was disappointed that these did not grow at all,0
satisfying middle book of a fantasy romance trilogy valeria is now accepted by the riding school where gods of patterns and time take the shape of white stallions and help determine the future of the empire but she and her teacher first rider kerrec both carry damage from their encounters with enemies of the empire those same enemies barbarians who follow the unmaking which would lead to the destruction of the world threaten the empire again can two damaged riders and the stallion gods who carry them help the empire win a deadly war while this is the middle book of a trilogy i preferred it to both the beginning and concluding books i tend to be a reader of fantasy rather than romance and i actually think that the romantic triangles quadrangles in the other two books detracted from the plots of those books they really felt sort of forced to me,1
beware first of all this book is not NUMBER pages as listed it is only NUMBER secondly this book only consists of english words and their chinese equivalents in simplified character form no pinyin and no example sentences this book would only be useful to chinese people who want to translate english words directly into chinese this book is advertised as both english chinese and chinese english however there is no chinese english i ordered this book before it was released and just received it i am extremely disappointed i repeat no pinyin and no example sentences,0
sometimes less is more i saw this film because i was such a fan of the orignal version what a dissapointment this film goes heavy on the gross out and special effects because the story is weak and full of holes the original was much scarier because of what you did not see the imagination is a powerful tool we can imagine much worse that what we see just knowing the blob was somewhere without actually seeing too much of it provided me with years of nightmares i own the dvd of the original and watch it at least six or seven times a year matt dillon was the flavor of the month when the remake came out his performance was less than remarkable an earlier review mentioned that dillon was a much better choice of teen angst rebellion than was steve mcqueen interesting where the hell has dillon been since this abortion of a film mcqueen is an icon and is still much more popular than dillon mcqueen is also dead,0
the blob fear has no shape this NUMBER version of the blob is fantastic i love this movie so much words can not describe shawnee smith kevin dillion donovan leitch erika eleniak candy clarke and the always georgeou ricky paull goldin are all perfectly cast in their roles the effects are great i adore the music chuck russell made the best movie one of the best movies around,1
a family saga that disappoints i got this book because ursula hegi wrote an oprah winfrey pick stone from the river some years ago and i remember enjoying that book while i love a good family saga i cared nothing about any of the characters in this book it was tedious boring and repetitive the premise of how an act in childhood affects members of several families for years to come seemed intriguing but it was the only reason that held me to the end and then i realized that the book was actually a waste of time,0
excellent even for those without formal musical training excellent book does not assume any musical training explains everything starting with the music notation the exercises are truly gradual each introduces only a few new hand positions and future exercises reinforce hand positions introduced earlier the early exercises are simple yet sound reasonably well not to be hopelessly boring and one can hear when one plays them incorrectly great book for self study it was recommended to me independently by two very good classical guitar players and my technique and sight reading skills have improved notably since starting to use this book,1
another rocking weeds season yet another awesome season of weeds a must have it you have the other NUMBER seasons,1
great series a must have series on the lines of sherman oaks if anyone actually saw it hats off too showtime i only wish i could find the sherman oaks series on amazon,1
kate mulgrew before voyager a time for miracles is an underrated gem showing a bit of american history that is often neglected and showing kate mulgrew as a determined woman who was strong willed clever not afraid of anyone and was fond of coffee no wonder she was cast as katherine janeway,0
endless supply of ink the ink was inexpensive considering how much ink it is i think it will take me at least a year or two to use it all i have been writing with the pen nonstop as my primary pen for NUMBER months and the first bottle is not even noticiably lower on ink shipping was also fast and everthing arrived in good shape overall a great experience,1
how to write a movie in NUMBER days i purchased and read this book because it was recommended by an author that has helped me develop in the screenwriting craft but i did not find it particularly helpful or practical however you might draw some inspiration from it,0
this book makes anyone think he she can write a screenplay with the inner movie method wonderful intro author clearly explains that if the readers want a more difficult route they can go with syn field books but this book will get you off and running thinking about the task of screenwriting for what the author intends to do i give her NUMBER stars the inner movie method is the start of your journey to writing a screenplay or to just understanding the movies you see better it concise upbeat can do in spirit accessible short chapters exercises some good summaries i like her overview of the stages of life movie theme that concern each a pleasure to read guaranteed to enhance your movie going experience but again this is a place to begin,1
sarah and excellent description of these two characters sarah is an alien but she is also a woman who is desired and connected to neither character realizes just what is happening to them at first during the landing of sarah spacecraft while she is saved by and his crew she has already defended herself on the spacecraft from some of her enemies also aliens she is very near death when it crashes in the mountains near the vla very large array in new mexico both sarah and have led very colorful lives before this encounter and both want out of that past life this is a book that has to be read when you have the time to just do it cause it was hard for me to put it down,1
out of the ashes the soka gakkai was forged out of the rubble of postwar japan this is the story of how a small group with a generally poor and ill membership overcomes the harshness of the environment and forged a new chapter of buddhism for the critic above one simple question has anyone who has criticized the sgi done anything to help humanistic causes all over the world the only thing critics have to offer is silence,1
a great summary of labor law i am an esl teacher with a background in law a colombian lawyer who had previously studied with me asked me to help her with the differences between our labor laws this book was an excellent introduction to labor law anyone who needs a summary of this area will benefit from this book tcb,1
very disappointed very disappointed with this item first when the knife arrived it obviously had been a return from someone else because the plastic was sliced open and the knife had been removed before but my son really wanted this for christmas so i kept it because i had not been able to find another one anywhere else it was a christmas present and the leather sheath broke on christmas day after wearing it only about NUMBER hours however my son was very happy with the knife so now we are trying to find another sheath for it,0
superficial i found the content of the book very superficial it deals with eliminating the symptoms of lack of motivation things like kill your television read yourself a story these are chapters titles from the book do not expect a deep philosophical of psychological insight about human motivation or even human nature in general from this book,0
good video great gift for new parents this video is an excellant video for new moms and dads and in addition for anyone who will be helping with the newborn to give mom and dad a break the only drawback i found with the video was the length of the video i wished it had gone into more detail most specifically caring for the crying baby and also care of the baby up to NUMBER months however i can find no fault in this being a beginners tool for learning and also a refresher for us who have not taken care of an infant in many years i purchased this video for first time parents i wanted to watch it before giving it to make sure it would be something i would be glad to give as a present i am glad and the parents were very happy to receive see visually is great because reading is good but for those who are visual people the instructions from this video will be more helpful a great gift idea,1
did not fit bcm carry handle just as the title says this mount did not seat properly or at all on my bcm milspec carry handle i think these are hit or miss,0
ccs yellow cutting pad used with a porter cable buffer vibrator this yellow cutting pad along with a cleaner will take out buff marks and swirls finish off with a white pad and polish and then when waxed your car will look like it has a showroom finish,1
worth it once we finally rec the correct item orig order not from this company so no reflection on them my husband loves it he uses it for cold therapy only his preference not that it does not work well for that so i can only tell you for cold therapy it rocks i did not think it was cold enough for my lower back but it is not sculpted for that he loves its flexibility and states it is cold enough he uses it for chronic neck pain just wraps it on his neck and goes to bed it has a velcro strap to keep it in place almost like having a neck pillow on but not as bulky fabu product,1
terrible disappointment parts do not fit my son almost NUMBER and my husband an engineer sat down to put this together many of the holes were either drilled too small or even worse drilled in the wrong place some pieces are cut the wrong size and just do not fit what a terrible waste of money there is no way to make it work without major drilling and sanding and then re painting my son is so disappointed he was really looking forward to putting this together,0
entertaining to the last page trollope is addictive but some of his books offer more nonstop entertainment than others and this is one of those,1
printer will not work now i have an hp officejet NUMBER and i figured i try this refill for my NUMBER ink cartridge filling it up was a pain because i had to hold the refill needly just barely into the created hole and let it drip in there slowly my biggest problem was that after i refilled my cartridge my printer would not let me use it anymore i kept getting an error message that said please remove and check your black ink cartridge i tried cleaning it resetting the printer tried everything to no avail i contacted the manufacturer of the refill system and they rapidly sent me a new one which i have not tried now i need to buy a new ink cartridge for my printer to even operate very disappointed,0
good i enjoy having a cartridge ink quick at my disposal the cost is very economical i will buy again,1
i was not pleased i was having trouble finding a copy of this classic movie anywhere i was eccited to see a copy on dvd unfortunatley the word copy is correct it was a copy the quality is good and the menu looks good but the disc was definetly a copy the case was also a copy i am glad to have this in my collection nonetheless but was upset it was not original,0
trite predictable tear jerker given the rave reviews of others i expected an absorbing thought provoking read i found instead a book riddled with cliches superficial character development and a predictable conclusion having just read ian mcewan atonement the contrast was dramatic all that matters would be a good fit for the condensed novel section of a traditional woman magazine all that matters is to fiction what rod mceuan listen to the warm is to poetry why do i feel that jan goldstein is hoping to cash in big with this one,0
all that matters i thoroughly enjoyed both of jan goldsteins books both left me wanting more stories from him characters are alive and make you care about them almost immediately i would recommend all that matters to anyone and everyone,1
item not available this item was out of stock so i did not receive it however i received timely notification from amazon com,0
twilight zone fans will love it i really liked this one it been a long time since i have read any short story collection and i am glad i read this one actually did not read it i did this one on audio there were different narrators for the stories lending different voices and all well done although the theme of hiring hit men was repeated in some of these stories they all kept me guessing also since they were all with twist endings i anticipated what might happen but did not often see what was coming this is my first jeffery deaver book i had avoided them since i hated the movie of bone collector but i now want to read some more of his books i am hoping that hollywood ruined a good writer work,1
deaver short stories are a joy jeffrey deaver is a master at creating the twist ending that you never see coming and these stories certainly showcase his talents i had a wonderful time reading them and every time he surprised me with the twists sometimes several twists in each story i particularly was caught flat footed by triangle and the christmas present which had one of those multi twists i mentioned of course as i said i was surprised and delighted by each of the stories and i am sure that anyone who is familiar with mr deaver work and or who enjoys thrillers suspense will enjoy the stories in this book characters range from shakespeare oh yea to deaver iconic lincoln rhyme as well as a host of new characters to delight and entertain readers and of course once you have finished this one you can go on and get the sequel more twisted collected stories vol ii both books heartily endorsed by yours truly,1
i want my money back i was the only one in my senior english class who loved the epic poem several years later i bought a copy of it at a comic book shop for some reason i liked christopher lambert and i thought he would be a good actor for a movie based on this classic tale man was i wrong aside from the names of the hero and one of the villians this movie has almost nothing in common with the poem it got nothing in common with a good movie it a travesty the acting even with a so called top talent like christopher lambert is awful the setting is almost non existant and the plot ah yes the plot i knew this movie would reek within the first NUMBER minutes i mean i tried really hard to be open minded but it was to no avail spare yourself the pain and skip the movie settle in on a dark winter night by a fire put on some quiet music and read the epic poem you will be glad you did,0
it is a lambert movie bad special effects lambert looked bored at times the plot has a few holes too much cleavage bad fight scenes beowulf can do multiple black flips and spin in the air and yet the monsters can still hit him the fact that grendel mother is pregnant does not really play into the movie but they keep bringing it up it is not the worst movie i have ever seen and i pretty much got what i expected so i am not completely trashing it the weapons were cool,0
inspiring and soul searching through a narrow gate is a testament to the personal struggle between feeling the faith and wanting to somehow live it too i am impressed with her ability to relive the experience while being fair to both sides and making their decisions and feelings make sense even when they are directly opposing the most remarkable thing is her feelings about the modern convents given her struggle and her respect for what was her respect is contagious she gave it to me she and her experiences seem to ratify my own even as mine pale against her story i recommend it to anyone seriously trying to understand god in their own lives and in their own terms,1
through the narrow gate older book with new foreword personal discription of life in convent by well known religious author,1
too goofy and cheesy since the book is one of the more expensive luna line books i just wanted to throw my two cents in to hopefully save you some of your hard earned money since i already wasted mine on this book what started out as quirky and light quickly turned terribly cheesy goofy implausible and over the top cliche with an almost nonexistent storyline about NUMBER pages in it reads like teen fiction and not in a good way and yet again in the steadily disappointing luna line almost zero romance take my advice and skip this sad attempt,0
eggs stuck immediately i bought this pan because consumer reports gave it such high marks the very first time i used it my egg whites stuck to it i used a plastic spatula as recommended as well i will be getting my money back as it has a NUMBER day trial period,0
perfect we received this as a wedding gift three years later it looks like new it cleans easily cooks wonderfully and has a great weight to it i have never had a teflon pan last so long without any signs of wear or tear this is probably the wedding gift we have used more than all others and i could not be more satisfied,1
a daughter of the mennonites very good read until NUMBER NUMBER am and could not wait to finish the book today would recommend it to any age group,1
needlessly repetitive to make the story more interesting this is the first hillerman story i have read so i understand that i am missing a bunch of background on the chee and leaphorn characters and my overall enjoyment might be hindered however of the NUMBER pages or so of this book at least NUMBER could be eliminated due to the repetitive writing the same bits of story being told two or even three times for no apparent reason i found myself wondering again and again if i had already gone over something only to realize that yes i had i am all for a story languidly and specifically unwinding toward its conclusion as this one does i think however that it needs to be done with some forward momentum and it needs to be able to maintain a certain level of interest for the reader the writing here is weak and the story not just obvious is really just kind of boring i am looking forward to trying out another title in hillerman canon with better results,0
based on a true story hey readers out there i just looked this book up because the november NUMBER edition of the los angeles times ran the true amazing story of this incident i guess now i will have to read the book when i do i will come back with my review you can get the la times on line,1
a great disappointment the plug into the gps NUMBER c will not stay connected with the gps on a table or upright on the boat where i planned on using the etrac both the a c adapter and the car charger have the same attachment plug i returned both to amazon when i returned from central america,0
cibo matto has made an incredibly boring album having heard the decent track by cibo matto sci fi wasabi on a cmj sampler i bought stereotype a thinking it might have other songs in the same vein much to my dismay it honestly is a boring album nearly the songs sound the same and the singing of miho hatori and yuka honda is inept and lazy cibo matto like several other japanese artists most notably towa tei tried to use the american fascination with seemingly alien culture to sell this album in the end all one gets is a collection of NUMBER yawn inducing filler pop tracks it has no redeeming qualities and i would recommend that people would find much more worthy music to spend their money on,0
you have got to be kidding why would they release such a complete mess like scifi wasabi as a single completely turns me away from wanting to hear the rest musically and lyrically a disaster i rather sit through karaoke night at the local drinking dive,0
better than the first but not as revolutionary as the first album viva la woman i bought this cd being told it was like the beastie boys were women that was a lie but cibo matto is crazy like the beastie boys their music is sometimes electronica sometimes alternative sometimes just plain weird the weird part makes sense because shaun lennon has an influence of this band one track reminded me of john lennon revolution NUMBER in that both still give me nightmares number NUMBER number NUMBER,1
excellent movies i saw mission impossible i when it first came out in theaters and did not watch it again until i bought this double disk set i enjoyed it just as much if not more than it incredible sequel both movies together even though they are very loosely related add up to a great buy,1
rust problems this is a great kettle with one serious flaw my kettle has started rusting inside the spout after NUMBER year there is a lip where the spout joins the base and water is caught there after use,0
a delicious spiritual journey for all those who have been are or are going to embark on a spiritual shopping spree mick browns a spiritual tourist is a delicious rendering of one journalists journey he remains scheptical and distanced from his subject matter throughout though on the odd occasion he can not help but get involved and be affected by the people he meets from the appearence of verbati in london to joining the throngs that sit at the feet of si baba though i did find this chapter long winded to a meeting with the dali lama and the theosophical society to crosses appearing on the windows of a church in the united states and his final chapter which i perticularly enjoyed being a visit to a buddist centre in england his journey is informative honest and inspiring i thouroughly enjoyed every minuite and found many of his conclusions enlightening,1
raises good questions but was it edited was this book edited i think the publisher should be ashamed if you can slog through the grammatical errors typos and generally poor writing you might find this book interesting however given that it appears to have been unedited and given that folks in the know have pointed out technical inaccuracies to me i would not take anything written in this book as the gospel truth it did raise some interesting questions that i will research i will think twice before buying a book from this publisher again,0
ellery queen mysteriesa this was a very different type of book from what i am usesd to it was very goog i am a big fan of ellery queen,1
a very nice shoe i bought this more for fashion than function but it has both it is a very comfortable shoe and very durable it is also really nice looking,1
great running shoe but why is price way up the double edged sword of rating a product highly you help out fellow shoppers but then the vendor raises the price i bought this exact shoe NUMBER NUMBER yrs ago for NUMBER w free super saver shipping now the shoe costs NUMBER shipping maybe we should all keep our mouths shut and what w the different pricing for different sizing sounds like discrimination to me could be a federal offense i have given it NUMBER stars to see how much higher the price rises,1
a classic it was just as good as i remembered the grand kids NUMBER NUMBER sat mesmerized for the entire movie ttkhanks for the nice afternoon,1
so sweet kept my NUMBER year old interested which is hard to do the ending is little weird bc it feels lime something is missing but cute movie overall,1
forced previews the movie is fine but the dvd has previews of other movies that can not be skipped over please do not pay money to support this practice if you pay for the movie you should not have to pay again by watching ads,0
a perfect film babe comes the closest to being a perfect film out of anything i have seen everything in the film should be there and nothing seems to be missing the funny touches with the mice the love between babe and farmer hogget the themes on family and self identity any adult or child can watch this movie and love it,1
not good at all this is the worst movie i have ever seen we had to see it in our class one day the teacher said that i had to watch reluctantly i sat down i hated it she fast forwarded it to the middle so we could see the end even that part was bad and i did not see all of it i give it NUMBER stars for horrible scenes cruelty to animals and lack of trying do not see it ever,0
no skip ahead function on this dvd babe is a wonderful movie but this dvd does not allow the viewer to skip thru the previews once the movie begins you can skip around but you have to sit thru a bunch of previews every time your kid watches this movie,1
dundee ii very good sequel moderate amount of action an actual plot unlike many new movies if you own the first this is a definite addition to your video home library,1
non stick coating wore off and is chipping after three months i bought this pan with high expectations given the strong reviews from other customers but after a few months of use i am very disappointed the pan takes several coats of oil to prevent food from sticking and now the non stick surface is beginning to flake off i always washed the pan by hand and never used anything other than plastic cooking utensils the last non stick pan i had was kirkland brand and it lasted four years,0
oldie and goodie my father got me hooked on these books they are extremely well written and just fun to read anyone who just wants a good mystery without all the sex and swearing will love these books,1
excellent stuff this face wash is great it light foaming and again in the first NUMBER hours of using the exuviance products there is a noticeable difference in my skin texture and overall look it amazing my proactive is going away and i am all over this stuff now,1
worse than surgery the jokes in this book are not only unfunny they are not worthy of actually being called jokes i have flipped through many of the pages in search of a good laugh and have not found anything remotely close i rarely post reviews out of curiosity i looked up this book on amazon and saw someone posted NUMBER stars this person is clinically insane i am that driven to post just to bring the average rating down you will get more laughs with your seven dollars by renting les miserables,0
amazing but not his best this is jimi most famous performance maybe since its included in the most famous concert ever still there are better concerts of jimi than this one it takes him and the band almost all of disc one to warm up on red house larry lee plays the lead guitar so believe me any other live version of red house is better than this one but just as the concert is near its end jimi starts playing star splanged banner and makes everything worthwile this is one of rock most memorable moments one of those that youll have stuck in your mind no matter what like elvis playing ed sullivan or the beatles coming to america so from that track till the end of cd NUMBER youll hear nothing but some of the best music ever recorded now if you can get the monterrey cd on a second hand shop that is jimi best performance ever or get band of gipsys instead,1
poor the product did not operate as stated on the box the supplier cdromusa was not at all helpful and left me with a product i am unable to use so they got free money and refused to send a replacement they do not deserve a star at all but the one star represents the nice deceptive packaging,0
movies that make you think how many times in our lives have we wanted a do over in our lives thinking if we could just change one of our actions things would have been so much better in our present day lives these movies make you realize life can never be perfect no matter how many times you could try,1
overpriced and too many restrictions on use this item is very overpriced i ordered it because i wanted the very best and i thought i would get what i paid for but it is no different than other pans a half the price also the information sheet that accompanied the pan had so many restrictions and warranty cop outs that if followed would make the pan almost unusable,0
my recommended buy had bought a set of the anolon advanced hard anodized nonstick cookware but it did not include a NUMBER qt covered saucepan this size is something i use a lot i love the lighter weight than the NUMBER yr old set we had the rubberized handle and lid are great i love the glass lid and the nonstick finish is great clean up is very easy i do not use high heat as directed but do boil in the saucepanwithout any damage being noted i highly recommend this size pan and the whole set it is less expensive than some of the more popularbrands but i like the look and function better i am a very satisfied customer,1
not good at all this book actually pokes on henry contemporaries and describes series of events which will eventaully lead to a horrendous headache to be suffered by the reader on the other hand fielding tom jones is a delight and must not be missed at any cost this book is a total waste though,0
a disappointment i have long been a fan of robert b parker spenser books but even though i watched them i did not really care much for the robert urich spenser for hire series too two shoes and ized that why when i found these joe mantegna movies i enthusiastically thought that someone made some spenser movies that were a little more and true to the books what a disappointment the stories were accurate enough but joe mantegna as spenser a former cop and boxer i do not think so i found him and the actors filling the roles of hawk and susan to be completely unbelievable and wrong for the parts these movies really made me miss the robert urich series,0
the power of the witch i loved this book it very informitive i like the fact that my friend who is very far from being pagan read it and understood it it does exactly what the man behind the counter told me it would do teach i even email laurie and told her how much i loved it,1
not impressed by cabot i expected great things from cabot books i was let down i did not care for her writing style nor did i find her information moving or educational i am genuinely surprised that so many people find cabot to be a literary value i just do not see it i would not recommend cabot works to anyone interested in paganism or witchcraft,0
a guide to one night stands this book is confusing and difficult to follow because the author tries to cover one night stands and polygynous dating with the same advice basically you will probably get laid using these tips but the type of woman you will reel in may not be the type you want to see again ever for example what do you think happens when you use money as an incentive to control womens behavior she is going to use sex in a similar fashion to control you unless she an idiot but hey if you read this book with the goal of getting laid you are probably into that,0
not entirely original actually everything in the book is helpful and a ok read but most of the material is free on the net already the stuff from the layguide was mirrored on all kinds of websites all over the place before it ever became print if you search for keywords like layguide and player guide on the net you will find this stuff is basically plagaurized it was just a compilation of a bunch of usenet posts now if you really want something in print and original too do yourself a favor now and go buy the art of seduction by robert greene also available here on amazon com the guy researched great seducers and seductions throughout history and came up with types of seducers the stages of seduction etc and his work is entirely original as well,0
some reasonable advice i like the book but its a bit over the top in places there is some good advice and if used sensibly is okay its a good book i recommend these also available from this site NUMBER u s s undercover sex signals by leil lowndes NUMBER how to pick up girls by eric weber NUMBER how to meet the right woman by roger ratcliff david conaway diana ohlsson NUMBER how to pick up get dates with beautiful women secrets every man should know by john eagan b a NUMBER understanding women the definitive guide to meeting dating and dumping if necessary by romy miller,0
read the art of seduction instead this is amateur stuff if you want to get really useful and ground breaking stuff read the art of seduction i know that it long and a bit academic in tone but it is the last word on seduction in the modern age true seduction is not just a one shot get laid tonight approach although it can certainly include that read the art of seduction and you will be well on your way to having women desire you to a degree that is truly shocking i am a true believer and i owe the author robert greene a debt that can not be repaid it is mind boggling how much women really want to be carried away by their desire arm yourself with an understanding based on greene book and you will be well on your way,0
for anyone else NUMBER stars for laura it her nadir wishywashy cause proclamation from a once brilliant tunesmith and vocalist it okay to buy into feminism tree hugging and wicca in one personal life but to create an album on a major label about this stuff to slow and barely tuneful music is a major mistake if you are unfamiliar with laura nyro this is not the place to begin try eli and the thirteenth confession the first songs or pretty much anything else leave this one for gloria steinem or the next peta convention,0
one of the worst spokeseman for my party let this illogical hack please not defend my party and makea case against the liberals she does not get it and makesso many ridiculous arguments that do not hold up her writing style is horrendous please do not wastetime on this book i would give this rating a negative NUMBER starsif i could,0
better than the swiffer i love the simplee clean microfiber swivel mop it is bigger and easier to use than the swiffer and you do not have to keep buying replacement sheets just wash and go a much more environmental and financial choice than other cleaning options,1
my floors are always cleaned with a clean mop now i do think this item works great as a mop and as a dust mop it really picks up all of the hair fuzz and dust sadly this is why it is not NUMBER stars corners and edges will find you using a regular broom instead of this gadget as it just can not handle those areas i love that i can throw the pads in the washer and let them air dry no more mopping with anything less than clean,1
depends on your situation i bought this along with the authors grammar reference which has proven an expensive mistake the two are college level texts and probably quite good for those engaged in intellectual pursuits i on the other hand teach esl as a volunteer and was simply looking to shore up my practical knowledge of the subjects both texts contain virtually no such information in fact they assume a significant knowledge of linguistics and linguistic theory they are literally packed with obscure jargon that i presume familiar to some set of initiates but certainly far beyond my ken if your situation is analogous to mine i suggest side by side spanish english grammar and practice makes perfect english pronouns and prepositions much less expensive NUMBER the pair i think and much more practical,0
does a good job mach NUMBER does a fine shaving job and it better than the cheap razors you find at the supermarket they are durable although not as much as i like i believe that mach NUMBER cartridges are more widely available than schick quatro cartridges and that the NUMBER blades were overkill let us wait for the NUMBER blade razor to see how that works also with amazon subscribe save feature they arrive at my door with discount and i never run out of them nice,1
works just fine but not cheap at all i get NUMBER shaves with each razor after that it causes pimples i find it too expensive but there is no better alternative,1
horrible shaving system i purchased the razor and blades as the double bladed sensor was out of stock this is the worst design gillette has yet put forth the NUMBER blade design is much too wide and clumsy the only shaving done with this razor system was my first layer of skin,0
mach NUMBER or crap NUMBER very poor quality blade feels blunt and scrapes rather than cuts i used a whole pack of NUMBER in NUMBER week each blade was only good for NUMBER shave do not waste your money,0
somehow not as good as birks they run much smaller than birkenstocks i sent the size NUMBER back which is comfy in the comparable model in birkenstocks is it the boston and got the NUMBER and it still feels small the upper is ok the shoe is not the best made thing but is adequate it just the size thing that bothered me,0
very nice my wife and i go on vacation only once a year but this is perfect for the beach it also nice to walk on the board walk or in surf shops,1
good piece of collection this video reflects the early years of pink floyd in that time a bunch of innovative guys mainly syd probably because his use of sychedelic stuff trying to bring something new in terms of music if you are a real fan this would be very rare and interesting but if you expect the late sound of pf with waters and gilmour maybe you will feel quite shocked i rated it NUMBER because is a short document and the sound is not the best although for this kind of information this is not important the real value of the video is to see them in the context of a very important moment in the history of pop music,1
garbage i will keep it short and sweet this product is garbage i purchased a vinyl cover to further protect the item but it became a rust bucket and fell to pieces the company response we will send you NUMBER nice do not waste your time money keep looking,0
superb short stories this book is a delightful surprise with a wide range of well crafted short stories sure to entertain any fan of the genre a few of them resonate with the reader long after the book finished particularly a tale involving the history of a backwoods baptismal pool and a married couple slow and sweet farewell after the wife is diagnosed with a terminal illness i will read them again after a year or two the ultimate compliment to a short story collection,1
update of the old book it was a rather frustrating book since it was just an update of the previous generation book for vc NUMBER NUMBER it seems that sams wanted to be the first to sell in order to sell this is rather bad for the company since it will lose many of its potential customers in the future the only chapters worth reading well at least a little bit are chapters NUMBER and NUMBER and nothing more,0
clapton masterpices i am a big fan of eric clapton and his music dating from the yardbirds forward he done a tremendous body of work unfortunately you will not find much here worth buying the overall content and quality are pretty poor rather than masterpieces this more like the stuff left for good reason out of many other dvd covering his work,0
long walk to freedom ever since their emergence on paul simon graceland the unique harmonies and rhythms have kept me enthtralled the notable thing about this cd is how their famous guests adapt to their sound choice of material and blend is solid some collaborations work better than others mellissa ethridge and natalie merchant are two standouts this a worthwhile introduction this group,1
slow moving pretentious and out of date if you are a fan of apocalyptic fiction there are many better books to read than this while i did finish it i found it slow moving very slow pretentious in language and very out of date in the effects of war i think the real message was about the value of civil defense an interesting point but the author writing in the mid NUMBER was talking about efftects of atomic bombings that are much milder than true totally unrealistic,0
a very beautiful coffee table book i love the book could not be more pleased with everything i know i will treasure this book for the rest of my life and will share it with my friends and family because it will live on the coffee table in my sunroom for everyone to see,1
worth the wait it great to finally see this album released on cd i have wanted this for a long time hot on the heels of the biggest prize in sport album this was released by polydor in the usa clearly with the idea of riding the cresting new wave sure it was probably NUMBER most commercial album but listeners are treated to some great catchy hard rockin songs no it not punk but these guys never were really prime safety pin disciples a very consistent album sing along and what a great live band they were,1

make sure product is for your gps i recommend the product if it is for your specific gps i purchased a garmin gps NUMBER csx and amazon said people who buy this product also buy and all the also buys were for different model gps and did not work with that unite so be careful when ordering,0
garmin NUMBER c power cord the powercord sent was a straight connection rather than the NUMBER degree one and would not stay plugged in to the unit i wish i would of tried it before cutting and soldering to my motorcycle connection tis junk and can not use it money wasted,0

great gift idea they love it i bought this for my grandson who loves ncis he was so tickled he is collecting the series,1
another good season for an already great show this is a solid season with several great episodes the characterization is some of the best it not quite the same as we have lost kate and gained ziva but the dynamics and chemistry really develop well if you like season NUMBER and NUMBER you will like NUMBER as well,1
NUMBER rd season of ncis this was a interesting season for the show everytime you watch the show you learn and see something different,1
very disappointed the ncis movie i ordered came in in a timely manner it was in the condition stated at the time of purchase these are the things i am very pleased with not having watched this series on tv as we do not have cable or an atenna in our home i was unaware of the skanky nature of this season the intellegence and absence of immorality that i have seen on the few episodes i watched outside the home caused me to purchase i am extremely disappointed in this episode and the following one the rounchyness far out weighed the intellegence by far now i am very very leary about purchasing any other episodes i did enjoyed episode one which i borrowed from my neice the moral deploriaty is why we do not have cable or an atenna in our house these have gone to the trash as is fitting for such lack of marality,0
season NUMBER is great continuing right where season NUMBER left off with the murder of agent todd the team adds NUMBER new members to their cast the new director is named jenny and has a previous relationship with gibbs and the new agent is named ziva,1
a feast for the ears i have had this album yes the hard vynl thing since NUMBER now we can get these great works of art right on our pcs my favorite as always been bouree i think this is one of the neatest pieces ever written i love the images it invokes strap those head phones on and be transported into the romance of dancers in veils and moonlit desert nights,1
law gives a great overall view of this modern type career for both men and women provides the nuts and bolts of the career,1
terribly dissappointed i had watched this version when i first got it but must have missed the missing coral sea parts for some reason it jumps from the scene where rochfort has told garth about operation af coral sea to where they are telling rochfort that they had a rough time at the battle some really great scenes are missing in this verison hope that they release a full version sometime soon its a shame that this movie was so downgraded from the original bottom line do not waste your money wait wait wait for them to put out the full real collector edition i note that the added for tv scenes seem to be more personal and probably added for the ladies but were not they in the theater version too i seem to remember seeing the scene with garth and his girlfriend talking at their apartment before he leaves in theater perhaps age is starting to show in me,0
great flick i took my father to see this movie in theaters back when it was released in the NUMBER he was a marine who served in the pacific and told ne how important this battle was i needed to have it in my collection,1
close this is a close fictionalized movie of the beginning of wwii it is interesting and a great flick to share,1
terrible continues to freeze movie and my tv will not purchase streaming movies again useless suggest no one get this,0
great flick good movie one of a very few on the battle of midway the additional storyline a japanese love interest was distracting however,1
profanity galore this is not the tv version if you loved watching this on tv as a child you will be surprised at the language in this version if you are sensitive to profanity do not get it,0
midway i have never received this item it was first mis delivered not to me and never arrived now it has not been sent as for the movie i have seen it more than once it a great movie just wish i could get it delivered can you help me out,1
midway very well done both on the part of the japanese war plans as well as our own i lived in that era and remember the situation very well i would recommend this movie to all aages,1
poorest war movie ever made on dvd while we are still waiting for longest day somebody got to be kidding this one really sucks here we go stock shots ripped off from seconds over tokyo tora tora and probably other movies wwii newsreels footage extensively cropped to fit into the panavision frame meaningless cameos by various aging stars probably to make the flick look like a blockbuster historical mistakes and countless errors about planes and aircraft carriers inept dramatization the predictable romance between heston son and a japanese girl you name it the only reason i give this awful turkey one star is because the software does not allow me to give it none,0
a classic war film very underated people complain about how this film uses some of the same historic footage tora tora tora uses this wwii footage is great and should be used in different war films just because it was used in that film dosent mean it can not be used in midway it not like they took scenes made for tora tora tora and put them in this film historic footage is used and reused in many films how many times have we seen scenes with president kennedy in different films the same populer footage of him this film is an epic war masterpiece the acting is superb people complain about the japanese speaking english you are supposed to imagine them to be speaking japanese it not like a mistake the film makers made that makes the film appear cheaper or something this film gets very little credit and is always in the shadow of tora tora tora i think if you collect war films you should own both midway is a true classic,1
i had a great expectation for this what would you get if you took a bad script uninspired acting ww NUMBER stock footage scenes from tora tora tora and put it in a blender and mixed it around the answer midway this reeaallly bad movie suffers from everything ww NUMBER stock footage is over used most of it did not even take place during the battle of midway and the scenes from tora tora tora are out of place a corny love interest gets in the way of the action too much lot of familiar faces in this but their acting is uninspired and the script is dreadful about NUMBER minutes of important footage was cut out of the original release including the battle of the coral sea please avoid this film,0
the best its the best music i have heard in some time if you are in to world music or just looking for some thing diferent well it does not get much better then this,1
intense vibrant pure hardcore party vibes here with infectuous spirits that can intoxicate rockin tunes include legalize it downpressor man and a fantastic get up stand up hard and fat bass lines solid drumming and vocal chants work to induce a tribal fever and a mood to celebrate life,1
like being at a drive in the film played on countless dusk till dawn horror bills at drive ins through the early NUMBER and this disc does a pretty good job of taking th viewer back to those long gone days of cheap thrills the picture and sound quality are only about average just like the drive in the only other thing you need is for someone to park their car outside you living room and honk thier horns during the nude scenes and the movie well it about average as well the plot concerns a plot to get an inheritance and a bunch of greedy heirs a true b movie on all counts but not without a certain trashy value those who spent warm summer nights watching this flick when it was paired up with the likes of do not answer the phone and point of terror may want to give this reasonably priced disc a look,0
excellent look into african american history i just completed this novel and i must say that it was excellent it was quite obvious that the author had done extensive research into her subject matter it was a poignant look into history and how african american women had to struggle in a world where they were often looked upon as inferior everything from the descriptions to dialogue was well written and i look forward to reading more of ms singleton work,1
n a who is joe nickell what are his qualifications for these research endeavors and the knowledge to properly assess all parameters involved in scientific research,0
set of NUMBER NUMBER hardwood datio bokken practice sword i bought these for myself and my son for aikido weapons training they are not very well made and appear to have been factory seconds to clarify there are cracks in both to point that they might easily break and splinter one is practically straight with no curve the handles are nicely wrapped but the wrapping tends to come off with use there is also removable plastic guard or tsuba which is not very functional and more decorative you get what you pay for and these are not high quality hence the expensive price i will eventually buy something better,0
cheap and it shows i got these as a gift for a friend so that we may have some fun sparring however one sword came with a large crease in the wood that proved to break open after only a couple hours of use they also had a strange chemical y smell to them for quite a while they can still be good display pieces but i would recommend getting synthetic swords if you plan on seriously using them the extra cost is worth their durability,0
christmas present love these practice swords i have purchased some before and my son just plain wore them out these are for christmas and i already know he will love them,1
victum of sinility ironically while doing an update to the catalog of my movie library i ran across this one and decided to watch it this evening having no recollection of it i see that it has great review ratings from other owners and their details i will leave to you to peruse this is a great mystery drama do not miss it regards edb,1
justifiable revenge i think that camille keaton handled the attack with as much diginity as she could muster up what she does afterward to each of them is well deserved rape and nude scenes so please beware this NUMBER o film was raw and has become a true classic in the vein of charles bronson NUMBER to midnight this is a classic get it while you can,1
a classic of its kind this movie is a classic of its kind and much better that a lot of movies that followed it is not one of the best but it still deserves five stars,1
watch a woman get raped beat terrorized oh how fun i watched this when i was a young girl it still haunts me to this day if you enjoy watching a woman get viciously raped for almost an hour then this is the movie for you,0
based on a true story based on a true story if this is true then it is more horrible than being a fictional fantasy did anyone witness this woman being raped people are just going on a murder word that she was rape by these men they did not have the dna test back then and when it did come about a lot of women were found guilty of lying about being raped since when is it all right for anyone to take the law into their own hands i guess it was NUMBER when it started for women or maybe before you would never say it was okay for a man to murder a woman no matter what she did to him this is sexist and sick,0
NUMBER stars talk about rubbish you want to talk about rubbish be honest people this is not a horror movie or a scary movie this is just pure garbage what cinematic value does this movie have to offer zero i am all for horror movies but this movie just is not horror scary or even shocking it just lame it is about the raping of a girl and she gets revenge wow what a worthless waste,0
has live grain bugs i received my order a couple of weeks ago the shipment has live bugs sawtooth grain beetles i have had to move the bag from my pantry to the garage i have sealed it and placed it in a closed can but still not sure how to kill them without contaminating the seeds usually i place a bay leaf on the top of any grain to keep bugs out this bag was received with live bugs already in the shipment the seeds sprout okay after rinsing them so they deserve at least one star,0
the book of vodou charms and rituals to empower your life for such a little book it is quite informative i bought a copy when it was first published around NUMBER years ago found myself reading referring to it many many times i have had an interest in vodou for many years like some that did not grow up in haiti or anyplace where vodou is present the book of vodou is a great introduction this book is a very appealing glimpse into a beautiful religion that is often misunderstood it has great photographs throughout is straight to the point about the origins history of vodou from west africa all the way up to the present day without information overload i have been a practioner of the arts for many years as well as a historian there not one negative thing i can say about this book it one of my favourite books on vodou in fact i am on my fourth copy if you any interest in vodou start with this book you will not be disappointed,1

love it i have really curly thich frizzy hair i found this product a local beauty supply store and love it i now have soft flowing shiny beautiful curls i used to need mousse curl enhancers and tons of products to wear my curls since i started using this product i can just spray some leave in conditioner and i am good to walk out the door i usually apply it NUMBER x a wk over night and just rinse out in the morn no shampoo,1
disappointed i loved the original poster i lost due to a move i decieded to replace it and ordered this poster but when i recieved it it was not black and white but black and blue,0
not a great book i was a little surprised by the content of this book it is really not a book i would recommend it is about a grandma who takes her grandkid to the beach and nothing goes right then it ends i thought it could have been more meaningful,0
finally i can style my own hair i have read many reviews on this site some negative some positive i have a lot of hair my hair is full of texture my hair does not grow down length it grows out wide i would never use a hair dryer before i could not unless i wanted to look like a clown this product is the first product that allows me to dry my hair the product does get very hot that is what my hair needs to become straight and manageable however if you do not have frizzy and unruly hair this is product was not made for you i however must say finally,1
infiniti by conair bc NUMBER i have shoulder length curly fine hair i followed the directions for use and i ended up with a messy head of frizzy hair the brush does more blowing than straightening in my opinion it is fine for drying hair but i did not get the sleek smooth shiny effect that was promised by the straightening tool it was nothing like the salon straightening job i normally get i will be returning this styler asap very unhappy,0
twice the effort for half the sleekness my hair is about NUMBER straight and NUMBER wavy so you would not think it takes much to make it sleek straight and shiny i even use an ant firzz serum before i style but using this conair took twice as long as drying and straightening my hair in two steps and gave me half as straight hair i even used my regular blow dryer first to get most of the dampness out thinking this would speed up the process but no it took ages the conair is basically a very small hairdryer with a few brush bristles when i was finished my hair definitely had frizz and fly aways and i had to go back over it with my chi flat iron i really wanted to like this product and to save time but i will be returning it,0
not worth it if you have never used a flat iron before do not even bother this product does not come even close to the results i get when i use my flat iron a waste of money to say the least,0
works well for thick hair if you have the time i have really thick shoulder length hair i only wash my hair twice a week and once my hair is dry and straightened i do not need to do a thing with it this product works really well for me as long as i have the time to spare i takes me at least NUMBER or NUMBER minutes to dry and straighten my hair once it has been towel dried i bought this product because i did not want to spend the money for more expensive similar items i think that for the price the infiniti is well worth it,1
conair straightener i have very thick very wavy hair thie straightener works well on my hair it is easy to use it also does not take a week to get my hair dried i cut my hair to shoulder length and found it does work better than on long hair although i did get it to work on my long hair too i am very pleased with this product i definately recommend it,1
does not perform the functions advertised this hair dryer claims to style smooth and streighten do not count on it i have medium lenghth fine hair and i wish i never bought it however it might work on longer hair not a high probability forget this product and empty promises,0
stopped working after second use the dryer worked fine but i only use a hair dryer occasionally so i only used it twice in NUMBER weeks when i went to use it the third time it was deader than a doornail no power i guess the stress of sitting in the cabinet for a few weeks was too much for it too late to return it i have seen other reviews with a similar problem so it seems they have some quality control issues to work out and if you buy one it the luck of the draw if you get a one or not i am generally very pleased with my purchases through amazon but this one was a dud,0
not what i was hoping for i was really hoping for a dryer that would get rid of some of the frizz and curls i started getting when i turned NUMBER an unexpected and unwelcome byproduct of aging this seemed perfect but the dryer is so weak it takes forever to dry my hair and virtually no straightening effect after using it i still have to straighten my hair with a flat iron so i have gone back to drying my hair with a regular dryer more power and therefore faster and using the flat iron i guess i should have known it sounded too good to be true,0
baffled i ordered it thinking it was something else and then when it arrived i was intrigued and had to try it okay it will straighten but not certain the point of it i can not use it to curl the ends and it seems a flat iron would do a better job i used it once did not like it tried it the second time to see if i just was not using it right and still was not thrilled it is now in my dead heap pile of unused hair gadgets,0
disappointing at best sadly i had high hopes for this little wonder but it did not deliver it is difficult to maneuver and not powerful enough to blow out my short flippy style,0
love this thing i have moderatly curly hair and have never known how to style it i am uncoordinated with flat irons and round brushes with hair dryers this thing is awsome i can easily style my hair straight and not feel like i need an extra hand it is adjustable depending how curly your hair is it is easily packable for traveling apply straightning product if desired after you wash then style when your hair is about two thirds dry or if you wash your hair at night just dampen it a little in the am and style,1
good ink i bought this to replace my omas black ink that was running out to use in my lamy NUMBER fountain pen the ink flows fine and gives even coverage on the two kind of paper i commonly use i would definitely recommend it the ink lost one star because it is a dark dark grey rather than a true black as was the omas but only suffers when held right next to one another i do not know if this is due to the paper i am using also it seems this ink drys a little slower and thus smudges somewhat easier this is not an objective measurement however but a feeling and obviously will depend on the paper used,1
too thin i purchased this after reading the great reviews and information at the manufacturer website this ink is waterproof but it is also very thin permeates nibs and runs all over the metal part of the nib if you use a paper that is not very absorbent it may work or on checks but on normal paper it flares and distorts writing the color when dried is not totally black but a dark gray,0
great ink a few weeks ago i bought a few disposable fountain pens to see if i liked them and after a few days i began using them as my primary pens the problem was that they had very bad ink in them so when i ran out of ink i decided to attempt to refill them with noodler ink and it worked this stuff is pitch black and best of all it does not bleed or feather when you are writing with it works well in pilot varsity disposable fountain pen assorted ink NUMBER pack pouch NUMBER,1
structurally sound but this is a good binder i only did not work for me because the width only is enough to fit NUMBER NUMBER x NUMBER sheets of paper if you wish to include tab dividers the will protrude past the width of the binder also the expansion is limited in that you start from NUMBER and expand to NUMBER inches the binder can not collapse smaller than NUMBER so as long as these two items are not an issue it is sturdy and durable,0
immoral movie this movie could have been so good the storyline was great and the relationship between mr sorrell his son is wonderful however there were lots of bedroom scenes leading character was very immoral and there was language in the end the son winds up euthanizing his father after the encouragement of his wife very dissapointed,0
entertaining tribute the celebration of duke ellington a century after his birth has produced a wealth of tributes and thankfully some fine reissues of his work this cd takes a more contemporary approach to ellington music resulting in a sort of smooth jazz sampler of the duke it a very entertaining approach with some stellar work by an all star roster of artists well worth a listen,1
they changed the words do not buy this one either unless you like grooving to the wrong words i thought i was going to be sent back to the good old days save your money you will not get a refund you can not call anyone i got it dry,0
poor product i brought this product NUMBER mths ago and it has been falling apart presently one of the legs of the chair has broke crack into NUMBER piceces i would like to know how do i go about contact the manufacturer about this matter,0
she so dull she started out as the german britney spears and somehow she got stuck there her songs have no message no great melody and are absolutely shallow so is her image she still stays clean in contrast to britney and it extremely boring and superficial when it comes to stardom no meant personally,0
it finally on dvd i have been waiting for this movie to come out on dvd since i first got a dvd player about three years ago ray liotta gives an excellent performance as a man falsely accused of murder trying to find his wife killer the plot is very interesting and original and presented so that it is believable and intense definitely a must have,1

akjee the book covers very detailed instructions for the beginners to understand and follow the psychic healing i have yet to practice and experiance the process,1
a waste of money i remembered watching this movie as a kid and really enjoying it however after rewatching the transformers season NUMBER NUMBER disc dvd set this movie pales in comparison the characters lacked personality and did not look as interesting as the others i recommend that you save your money and put it towards the more expensive but more enjoyable dvd box sets,0
forgive me ok ok i realize that i am going to be fried for this but here goes i loved this movie as a child i worshiped the tv series and i still have quite the collection of autobots and decepticons however when my friend got me this film for my birthday i watched it and found that it really did not hold my interest anymore i think this film better served its purpose in the NUMBER and is truly lost in today modern era of animation i would however like to see this film remade with better animation and a far better soundtrack i love the toys but i did not like this movie,0
cursing in this NUMBER hit movie for those who jest can not get over the part that there was some cursing in this NUMBER hit movie please consider that there was more of that in the live action movie the same live action movie that you took your stupid little brats to see get over it i bet you freak out when bugs bunny dress in drag too,1
matrix forever out of print again i can not believe this has gone out of print again its the greatest anime movie ever it always goes through long periods of time being unnavailable i do not get it maybe the next dvd version will be better than this one this version was great for being uncensored but the extras were weak it should have at least had two discs and included the alternate tv version or at least its opening star wars styled scrollthat replaced the opening credits the music video the touch was also not included also excluded were the animated bumpers narrated by a computer animated optimus prime that played when the movie aired on television in NUMBER partson the tv series they would have made a nice extra,1
darryls review on transformers NUMBER th anniversary dvd great movie to date the best version out there NUMBER disc it was great watching it with commentary from fans this was just awesome the colour and widescreen format are surperb many special features including commentaries interviews trailers etc the scramble city episode which is a special feature which i was looking forward to fell below expectations due to the fact you could only watch it with commentary only about four toy commercials there are easter eggs on both discs old diaclone toy commercials overall a great addition to my dvd collection and fully recommended,1

best movie ever i happy with this purchas it a used product but came in realy good condition i thought it took a lil long to get here but notice that it was from canada understood why it took a lil while but worth the wait,1
the decepticons learn a new skill how odd just as it really counts the decepticons learn to aim straight managing to wipe out five of the original transformers in one go after numerous attempts much as this film is very very good and the music is outstanding but it has as always all the same tramsformers inconstincies but much to all our pleasure it has all the wounderful and debonair wit of starscream that we have all come to know and love and with leonard nimoy adding a nice edge to galvatron still all in all a very good purchase,1
very good i saw this in the movie theather it rocked then and it still rocks the story line is superb the charactors are well written the violence might scare some young ones after i saw this movie i never stopped talking aobut it i highly recommend it,1
a blast from the past unlike many things i used to like and am rediscovering to find i do not like as much transformers has only gotten better with age man its like the best of western animation and japanese in an incredible amalgamation if you have never seen the transofrmers do not be influenced by their bastardized offspring beast wars this cartoon was and is great,1
disappointed by this board game i bought this game because it promised a green experience for the entire family i must say i was highly disappointed is it called green because you are dealing with vegetables so be it my family could not find any interest in this game not even my four year old whom we bought the game for i did not find the added value of this game do not waist your money on this,0

evolution is true science in no way refutes evolution if used correctly the authors of this book do not have an inkling of what is if you are thinking about buying this book do yourself a favor and go buy on the origin of species by charles darwin that is if you care about the truth this book is full of lies what it preaches is blatantly wrong and you would be a fool to believe a word of it,0
one of the most beautiful songs this song is about lyrics lyrics lyrics and leigh nash beautiful vocals i loved the bounce movie but this song is more beautiful actually its one of our songs for my boyfriend and i i think it should have recieved radio play but i do not think it did my favorite version of this song is the movie mix which is more like and extended version the only song i did not like is walking with strangers which is not sung by leigh nash i just did not connect with it at all need to be next to you is a good song for all you hopeless romantic types the music video is really cool it has images from the movie which enhances what i just said about being a hopless romantic so with that being said i give NUMBER out of NUMBER,1

i have such a tooth ache this movie had such a sugar sweet quality about it i got a tooth ache i am surprised they did not go back and save political leaders and the like enjoyable most of the time if you can get past the obvious lack of rational thought and wasted screen time i should have rented it on video not a suitable movie to sit through at the theatre too long rent it make popcorn take a break every NUMBER minutes you are good to go,0
unsatisfactory i waited almost two months to rent this video unfortunately i was disappointed the movie while poignant was spasmodic and disjointed i had to try too hard to piece together the events while they were occurring james caviezel performance was compelling dennis quaid acting was fair,0
a thriller of what if times meet very creative and well made thriller it is surprising viewers when u leave cinema or closes dvd video vcd u are thinking it is worth paying NUMBER or renting or buying for third dimension flick buffs,1
intelligent and heart wringing this is one of the few satisfying movies i can remember seeing apart from loving dennis quaid who puts in a great performance i like this film for its unabashed good storytelling it is tense because it allows us to grow incredibly involved with the characters moreover apart from the usual coincidence thing the science fiction plot does not have holes may you enjoy this movie as much as i did,1
illogical but wonderful even if you accept the basic premise of this movie a re connection between long dead fireman father and still grieving policeman son via ham radio you will find something profoundly illogical in some of the individual scenes that does not prevent it from being extremely moving thanks to beautiful flat out emotional performances by dennis quaid jim caviezel and flawlessly cast supporting actors look for an extraordinarily moving fire rescue scene some of the suspense set pieces worked into the story are superb this film definitely overcomes its narrative flaws walmer road in toronto puts in a fine appearance as a street in queens n y,1
fun science fiction this movie is a feel good science fiction movie with a murder mystery and plenty of action woven into it,1
frequency very strange to follow too much forward and backwards in the plot like the suspense probably will not watch again too shifty,0
a great character catspaw was my introduction to cat like other reviewers i expected a bit of lite fluff to while away a boring afternoon and got paydirt with a capital vinge creation whom she called in an interview the embodiment of her sense of outrage at social injustice is on my personal list of favorite literary characters of all time read the book and find out why,1
enjoyable book i am a country music fan and have seen the movie many times i wanted to read the book and i am glad i did it was enjoyable,1
excellant this bok was recommed to me by my daughterinlaw it was warm and funny and so true of loretta lynn full of truth and surprises,1
the soviet view of the cold war tass is authorized to announce is the soviet version of any spy thriller you have ever read or seen on the big screen but with the kgb as the good guys attempting to foil the sinster plots of the cia however semenov lacks the semantics of say a tom clancy the plot is razor thin the anti semitism is revolting and the the resolution of the conflict is laughable while the book is certainly dated cold war intrigue in africa is so passe it is an entertaining read if only to see how the ussr understood detente and cold war politics other than that the book is tripe not recommended,0
solitary witch i bought this book a few years ago it always a range between love it and hate it when it comes to her work for this one i just like it there is some information that i take and refer back to elements witches pyramid etc but i know that there more to my path i would not say that she fluffy only because she puts witchcraft in terms so teenagers can understand it there are things that i do not agree with but all in all it a good reference o,1
love love love love this book it has basically everything like a wiccan pagan dictionary of course you wouldnt read it from cover to cover you could but i wouldnt suggest it but thats good it means theres tons upon tons of info it great,1

if you buy this you are buying s t literally i love marilyn manson but after watching this movie i had a change of thoughts if you like to see band members vomiting band members deficating and then playing with it people rubbing stuff against their bare naked d ck and other profanity you should buy this movie i thought it would just be a movie of their tour but it a bunch of s t stick to the cd by the way i think courtney put a hell of a show on at the tour manson a bit sick i still think that manson kicks but some of the stuff he does just disgustes me so much and makes me think just what he puting in the minds of our youth today you think about it the shootings at that school for instance,0
tank top i am very unimpressed by this product sizing is very small and the product it flimzy and poorly made after NUMBER washings it had shrunk to the point where i just threw it away i would not recommend this product to anyone,0

you call this tai chi i would give this one NUMBER star if amazon allowed me i read all the good reviews on this dvd and decided to get a copy luckly we had one from the local library after i reviewed the library copy i am completely shocked that someone can produce a dvd like this one and call it tai chi it is not even half way close the demonstrator did not even get his movement right in fact the content of the dvd is a set of morning exercise combining a little bit of everything possibly asian primary school morning exercise some basic yoga breathing and postures some partial tai chi gesture coming from an asian background i almost felt this is an insult if you are serious about learning tai chi do not get misled by this dvd,0
video quality is very poor i think they copied the copy of a copy of a copy i like the video but it jumps ahead for the NUMBER minute workout i am done in NUMBER the NUMBER minute program is more like NUMBER i think of all of the tutorials i have seen only NUMBER all the way through and most it just skips over them it is horrible i tried this but the video is such poor quality that it makes it difficult to feel it is doing any good,0
morey is ignorant of the literature this book deals in stereotypes and caricatures it ignores the example of jesus christ and denies the exile status of god predestined elect people it begs the question continually by assuming that the responsible thing to do is to kill the bad guys as in his book on hell and the immortality of the soul there is no evidence of morey carefully reading the literature of those he attacks for a page by page refutation of this book i recommend richard barber whenis it right to fight never available from pilgrim brethren press po box NUMBER petersburg ohio NUMBER barber is a sovereign grace pacifist like me,0
shallow and poorly thought out the best thing about morey book is the recommended reading list at the end too bad he did not study some of the books he listed john howard yoder could have helped him tremendously for the most part he omitted the most significant pacifists of the twentieth century yet he claims to offer a rebuttal to a position he does not remotely understand this ill considered little book is filled with poorly examined assumptions if you are looking for a thoughtful and biblically insightful defense of war this is not it but if you want a shallow piece of work that may reinforce your prejudice when is it right to fight may be exactly what you have in mind,0
lee plays the good guy this has to be one of the finest of the hammer collection lee is piercing in his role as the duc de richelieu there are occultists galore and it up to lee and his pal to save the son of a friend and his lover from the eternal grip of the creepiest villan hammer studios ever unleashed you must see this movie in widescreen the visual created by director terrence fisher of the english countryside will give you a warm fuzzy until the final clash between good and evil,1
merlin not that good script for moviewhy do you need to add a specific amount of words less can be better especially in a review,0
did not speak to me prefer peaceful warrior series how to write a review about a book that does not speak to you difficult while i liked the teachings of don juan a yaqui way of knowledge at least the first part somehow journey to ixtlan did not speak to me at all it came across as boring meaningless walking and dialogues in desert without wisdom revealing to me i certainly preferred the whole dan millman peaceful warrior series with spiritual wisdom weaved into interesting adventures,0
the court jester danny kaye was a gifted comic actor who not only touched and entertained millions of children but at his best brought out the child in all of us a hilarious spoof on the swashbuckler picture the court jester is widely regarded as his finest screen hour with lots of color action and excitement framing the immortal gags this is family entertainment at its best,1
worst film ever by film end i was hoping the driller killer would show up to put telly and capser out of their misery in the end the only people you truly feel sorry for is the man on the subway with no legs and the skater punk who gets beaten nearly to death,0
horrible i am only NUMBER years old i would think that a movie like this would have an impact on someone my age it did not it nearly put me to sleep it was the biggest waste of money in my life i just bought it today and am throwing it away today also all this movie offers is an inaccurate portrait or teens and the story of a group of moron teenagers who thinks its cool to be going around drinking smoking engaging in brutal fights with people and other acts of vandalism having sex with girls between the age of NUMBER and NUMBER and stealing from their parents this was a huge waste of an hour and a half i only gave this movie NUMBER star because amazon does not allow me to give it NUMBER if you are looking for a movie that offers the story of troubled teens and is good thirteen is the movie you want to watch,0
yuck yuck yuck i hated this movie so unrealistic sure maybe there are some little freaks running around raping and drinking and beating but i am a teenager in a city nobody acts like this what the hell is the point of this movie to scare the crap out of parents also the rape scene was vile at first i respected the director for showing it and not shying away a full minute later i started feeling awkward and uncomfortable it was not even artistic it was just disgusting and truly disturbing,0
this a real movie about real things this movie paints a picture of what goes on in the lives of kids all across the nation daily this is a must see movie for many parents your kids may be faced with many of these decisions every day it portrays some of the pressure for teens in a modern society you need to see this movie and thoroughly understand it,1
great movie this movie was pretty good though there is a lot of sex drugs drinking violence etc i am from nyc and some ppl i know are like that i think it shows what teen life is like for some ppl in ny i loved how they used washington sq park a lot of ppl that are like the charaters in the movie go to that park for the same reasons skateboard pick fights do drugs etc this movie seemed so real and i hope there would be more movies like this NUMBER,1
excellent movie this movie depicts the real lives of teens grouwing up in nyc i live in nyc and i have seen all of this going on the only way to protect todays youth is to scare the hell out of them with movies like this,1
real life look into the life of teens this is my all time favorite movie in some ways i can relate to this movie i have friends who are just like these kids this movie takes a true look into a teens life i recommend this movie to other teens and pre teens,1
dream i remember when i thought this film was controversial lol that is until i saw bully anyway this movie is about a boy who is obsessed with girls and well all the kids lives are pretty much full of drugs and sex good ending what goes around comes around,1
not a kids movie being a teen boy i wanted to see this movie for all the hot chicks to my disappiontment there was not any just a bunch of guys having sex and walking around shirtless and showing us their rear ends justin pierce casper the blonde boy at the guys house that was shaking and kid urinating near casper are hot we get to see all of them shirtless if you get the widescreen dvd on the far left you can see justin behind in a graphic rape sex scene rip justin i will miss you you were so hot,1
nice debut saw these guys open for butch walker in boston a couple months ago and they played a nice set since i liked what i heard i picked up the album good stuff give it a listen,1
pretty but not made well they are not fitted they are very puffy and baggy do not fit at all like they are suppose to,0
something u expect this movie is terrible charectors are weak and the plot just plains sucks on white bread if anything you should see NUMBER girls i do not think this movie should have even been made,0
our father abraham our father abraham jewish roots of the christian faitha book every christian should read we can not fully understand the teachings of jesus and our bible without a through knowledge of jewish history and culture we worship a jewish savior who worshiped in a synagogue honored and practiced jewish rituals we read from a jewish book our bible written by jewish men to fully understand the symbolism in the bible we must know something about jewish religeous practices christianity is a branch attached to a tree that has its roots in judaism this book is one of the best available for a deeper understanding of jewish culture and religeon i highly reccomend this book to all christains wishing to have a deeper understanding of their faith and its beginnings,1
never got it never heard from them i never received this product and have not heard from the vendor except to ask for a review,0
bad backstreet boys if you have ever seen a david decouteau movie brotherood leeches werewolves of new york you know what to expect a homoerotic mishmash of ridiculous plotting hunky boys in skimpy underwear and relentless padding consisting of slow motion swaggering and lots of pecs and abs in ring of darkness adrienne barbeau swamp thing fog creepshow maude plays the boy band seductive manager who stages an audition to replace the band lead singer who tried to leave them after he found out what the boys in the band were in reality barbeau does well as always but the rest of the insanely attractive cast needs acting lessons badly by the time you have figured out just what these hunks do to keep their looks you have had to sit through some pretty derivative plotting and a predictably campy ending decouteau needs to rethink his future projects and at least come up with more than just pretty bods,0
wow bad even by decoteau standards a real time waster not even decent underwear scenes for those who buy these things for that,0
it was very wordy and the worst book i have ever read seriously this book is just convoluted and boring i can not believe this is called a classic its terrible and the educators at certain high schools should not force this book upon kids it lowers their grades and intelligence,0
love it the download was quick this story looks great on my kindle i am so glad to have purchased this item,1
never becomes passe i decided to read this book after watching it on pbs of course there was more detail in the actual novel and jane austen never fails to dazzle you with her footwork the description and narrative is beautiful and makes you feels as if you were actually there,1
did not like the paper quality and presentation i bought them all the barnes noble classics to complete my jane austen collection and honestly did not like the paper quality it seems like they did not even care for the presentation of them it did not look elegant cheap to be more specific,0
tough going reading this novel was slow going as a guy i found the lack of action stultifying and the flashes of humor were too quaint for me to derive any pleasure from them the answer to the book primary riddle who shall emma marry becomes obvious early on and everything else is just a tedious pairing off until that riddle is expressly answered there a bit of local and historical color but rarely does the narrative rise above the description of say a summer outing not one of jane austen best,0
just ok the first NUMBER jane austen books i read were pride and prejudice and sense and sensibility both i considered excellent books pride and prejudice being my favorite i had high hopes of emma considering it had been made into the modern movie clueless however i have found this book very tiresome and it took me a long time to trudge my way through it it may be the fact that i did not like the main character as i had in the other books but this book really went by slowly it was not that bad of a story and really deserves NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER stars instead of the given NUMBER stars but thats not an option i would still recommend people to read the book for the good plot behind slow movement and seeing this prideful heroine transformed into a more likeable person,0
what the fuss about jane austen i am so sorry but i simply fail to see what so wonderful about jane austen her writing is adroit and paints an intriguing picture of her times she illustrates the psychology of a historic culture but i just do not find her all that wonderful i realize i will be stoned by all the jane austen fans out there but there it is,1
help us all i am quite confused on how people could like this book for one it takes forever to get to the point plus how could we possibly like emma she is so self centered and ignorant the only two times in which she can somewhat appeal to us is when she crys and in comparison to mrs elton this is a mockery of upper class life of the NUMBER th century and jane austen to my knowledge lived a somewhat isolated life how could she write a book on a topic which she does not know about this further mocks the upper class leaving the point of this book as being entertainment why put us through NUMBER pages of pain i think jane austen was right when she said no one but myself will much like emma,0
great book this may very well be my second favorite jane austen book the plot is ingenious and the characters are hilarious dover does a good job of publishing and this book is no exception i highly recommend emma,1
i hate emma i do like NUMBER th century fiction i do like pride and predjudice i know lots of people do not like saying classics are uninteresting apparantly jane austen said after writing this book that she had wanted to create a character that no one would like but herself i am the only person i know who hates emma i agree that the book is well written but i just do not like emma sorry if you do,0
does not survive the test of time i endured through the entire audiobook because i finish what i start but this book had very little interest for me first i think it a chick book one that women would find more interesting second it about a spoiled brat that thinks herself the world with which most readers will not sympathize maybe the book was great in the time when it was published but the style does not suit me for these reasons the setting was not interesting for me NUMBER th century england in the countryside where nothing happens where propriety is more important that authenticity and passion the climax of the novel like the contemporary english culture is all too subtle for my taste and like the rest of the book lacks the drama that i expected from this supposed classic in short i think other great books have lasted the test of time but this is certainly not one of them it too easily loses your attention,0
austen sparkles as always but this is no pride and prej personally i love everything jane austen ever wrote to bits but none of her works except maybe the humorously offbeat northanger abbey can match the high standards set by pride and prejudice there the usual cast of comic characters and some scenes really are a scream but the heroine emma woodhouse and her frank churchill are a bit too brattish for my liking their acidly bitchy spoilt brat gossip about the most kind hearted and guileless members of the village is just a little too vicious for me and their appalling treatment of jane fairfax and harriet smith and the hilarious miss bates left me feeling a bit sick thank god mr knightley there to keep emma in line this is still a great novel as witty and funny as pride and prejudice but it comedy with a bit of a nasty undertaste,1
rubbish what rubbish way too much violence why do kids movies have to be so violent these days or when it was made had a few laughs i am an ex pat australian but not worth the plastic it was made from certainly not recommended for general viewing as the cover shows,0
bernard and miss bianca do it again in disney the rescuers down under rescue aid society mice bernard and miss bianca travel to australia to help mara houte the golden eagle with the assistance of wilbur an albatross and numerous other friends encountered along the way such as a wise cracking kangaroo rat they hurry to help the endangered bird voice talents of bob newhart bernard eva gabor miss bianca and john candy wilbur move the story along at a good pace george c scott provides voice for the villain a bounty hunter of endangered animals scott sidekick is a goanna lizard called joana and there is some fascinating interplay between the lizard and the man a sidebar plot is bernard plan to propose marriage to miss bianca and all of the things that conspire to get in the way this is a nice movie for the entire family and one with a good message i highly recommend it,1
cave twins review from grandkids or rather my granddaughters love it recommended to them by grandma who has fond memories of reading it when she was their age the feedback from heidi to whom it was sent was wow wicked brilliant,1
incorrect information in this book i do not recommend this book due to many incorrect observations and information noted in the chapters i was very surprised that this book was recommended by other readers because there were many mistakes and errors in the book some important topics were discussed incorrectly and others were too brief to find out and confirm this i gave this book to several local real estate contractors and they pointed out many other errors in this book that even i was unaware of they explained to me how many things discussed in the book were outdated or not relevant,0
negative review too basic and not too helpful the only time i would write a negative review if i think a book has been over rated this book is definitely over rated my husband and i are real estate investors and continually read books to improve our profits we both felt this book was too basic and we did not get helpful information we go to monthly meetings for investors in our county and this is one of the books on the do not buy list on our bulletin board,0
a must read for all home inspectors this book is the premiere reference book for new home inspectors the authors knowledge is based on thousands of inspections the layout and style of the book make it very easy to read and reference there is a lifetime worth of valuable home inspection information at a very reasonable cost must read,1
this book did not teach me anything i did not already know if you are looking for a book that will teach you a lot about real estate and home inspections then this is not the book for you the chapter information and text content of this book was very basic and did not teach me anything i did not already learn from other books that were much better inspecting homes is something i have done for many years and i would not recommend this book to any customers or contractors if you know absolutely nothing about real estate then you might learn a few things but not too much,0
garbage avoid the dimensions indicate NUMBER NUMBER inch which would be fine except it is apparently the folded dimension give me a break,0
freely available since those responsible for this animated version of animal farm failed to renew their copyright this came out in NUMBER this film is now freely available for example on youtube where it can be legally uploaded in its entirety it follows the book much more than the recent version did although still very loosely the biggest difference is its completely different more hopeful ending,0
the best bible story book we own we own many bible story books but this one is my favorite we read from this book every day and the kids love it it includes stories that are left out of many children bible story books it is wonderful to read in order and it really keeps the attention of the children when it time to shut the book my kids say what the story for tomorrow called mommy because they so look forward to reading this book,1
skip this author i purchased this relatively unknown book due in part to the positive reviews i was misled as an avid reader this book was underdeveloped and poorly written the numerous typos are distracting and the characters lack depth i forced myself to read the book hoping it would improve but it did not save your money do not buy this book or anything by this author,0
i love it i love this book i am almost done the series it is an amazing book there is a huge series coming after this book three other series i hope you like it rachael at age NUMBER and NUMBER NUMBER,1
the gateway to another world i started the book when i was seven or so and i almost could not put it down at night each chapter has gripping detail enough violence to satesfy a kid my age and the charecter actions and feelings were so real like that i felt like i was right there at a gathering right there at the fight between thunderclan and shadowclan right there in the thunderclan camp i am ten now have read the whole first series twice and have started the second series and i recomend this book to any kid who likes cats excitment adventure and a litle pinch of violence now and then in their books the begining of the story of rusty the so called kittypet who joins a clan of feral cats and saves the day in the end who came from firepaw to fireheart the thunderclan warrior,1
i love this book this is an amazing book with great action and is a pageturner with a great plot and lots of supense,1
great book very enjoyable you can never stop because this book is filled with suspends and cold hangers this was a great book,1
a great book i am sorry to give you this late response because i read this book today this was an excellent book i would recommend everyone to read this book this book inspired me about not giving up on your goal,1
one of the greatest books on earth i recommend this book to any person on the face of the earth this book is great for cat lovers dog lovers horse lovers any kind of lover after reading this i bought the rest of the series and i know you will love it too i say it should be awarded the newbery honor award read this book to find how rusty a kittypet a house cat finds his destiny to become a great warrior a NUMBER fan kierstyn forestfur,1
great oh this series is so good i am waiting impatiently for the NUMBER th one to come out and so i am reading all the other ones over and over again and i have just learned that there is to be a new series of warriors all new characters and clans stone clan sky clan and some other ones i forgot it called midnight and is coming out next year on march i am going to pre order mine now,1
love it okay first off i will tell you that all the books in the series there are four main series then a couple in between books are great however it gets to be too much remembering all the names what clan they come from who their mate is who there kits are who their friends enemies are who their brothers and sisters are it too much but i am not here to bag on the books i read the first one because a bunch of my friends were going on and on about them it a couple weeks later and i am just finishing the last omen sooo i do not know if that says anything other than i love warriors,1
amazing as soon as i started reading this book i was hooked erin hunter did a fabulous job capturing the readers intrest and keeping them interested even my brother who hates cats was compelled to read this novel,1
plotless it is an undramatic visage of what should be a dramatic era of margaret thatcher an example paragraph of the endless descriptions that mar the book if i am breaking copyrights laws let me know nick was not sure how it started sam zeman was laughing so much he lay back on the floor but then choked and had to sit up one of the girls pointed at him mockingly but it was not mockery she was laughing uncontrollably herself nat was red in the face pinching the tears out of his eyes and pulling down the corners of his mouth to try to stop it nick could only stop giggling by glaring at the floor and as soon as he looked up he was giggling again convulsively it was like hiccups it was hiccups all mixed up together with the whooping inexplicable funniness of the brandy bottle the renoir lady the gilded plaster crown above the bed all of them with their ideas and bow ties and plans and objections,0
not worth it after finally finishing this book i am very surprised that it won a prize the first several hundred pages have the main character nick guest doing little more than having sex fantasizing about having sex with every other male character major or minor or wondering if anyone else can guess that he fantasizing about sex perhaps it would be a better read for someone british because i found it hard to appreciate the depiction of life in the british aristocracy the character development felt very heavy handed and repetitive as one scene after another depicted nick feeling embarrassed or trying to figure out how to handle a social situation the end of the book was much more rewarding as the web of characters unravelled and their pretensions were stripped away i also enjoyed some clever henry james references still i do not think the investment it takes to slog through the beginning is worth it overall,0
my comfort book this book helped me raise three little boys born in two and a half years from diapers to trucks and fighting i found what i needed to know in these pages i am now sending copies to my three neices who have just had boys of their own truly trans generational,1
confusing even if you are not an idiot this book is poorly organized and confusing the authors used way too many quotations from other sources i e books websites in the end i have to wonder what the authors own take is on the subject it does not have a backbone of its own period,0
awful movie amazing but the name is the most redeeming quality of this movie the chain gang is comprised of men and only men men escape from a chain gang with a little help from two women acting is okay to bad quality is okay to bad story is okay to bad,0
social scientists take your medecine sowell is a true intellectual he is not afraid to go where his mind takes him in this work he takes on his common peeve social engineering for sowell nothing is worse than utopian minded do gooders armed with inadequate knowledge of the subjects they pontificate on to be frank i think sowell arguments are sometimes thin much social engineering is done well and is necessary but it is always good to read someone who will challenge convention especially when that person is as bright as sowell is,1
sowell is the soul of our time this book has only gained by the passage of time since it was written it is clear that his analysis of the huge separation between those who view man as constrained vs the modern liberal viewpoint has only grown deeper he actually makes the best case i have read for the liberal position and it is still sorely lacking i am so grateful that he lives and writes,1
very stable excellent quality very stable i ride indoors twice a week for a hour this device is perfect for keeping my bike steady,1

they are posers i bet you NUMBER that they stole destination unkown from the lyrics of ruby soho by rancid kicks there gay poopy areses there stupid punk wannabes like blink NUMBER listen to us bombs or rancid or operation ivy or the vandals or the dropkick murphys or the clash or sublime or the casaulties,0

destination unknown destination unknown by mest is such a great cd their songs are songs that people can relate to and the catchyness of the songs will stick in your head this cd is by far the best cd i have heard yet,1
mest is wicked mest takes every genre and mixes it together they have the pop punk edge of course over thuggish r b rap beats and they have some raggae and ballads mixed in there as well this is teenage angst with the humor of the beastie boys and the angst of good charlotte they are really eclectic and not too hard on the eyes either,1
i love this cd i love mest i have seen them in concert and they are awesome tony is great this is the NUMBER rd cd and i think it pretty kickass sure some of the songs are not so lyrically great but it fun to listen to the songs that stand out are drawing board who does not like this song cadillac for you people with some ghetto in you and yesterday vocals by jeremiah sounds awesome some of the weirder songs are reason and the hidden track they are both cool just too jamacian oh well i still listen to them if you want a nice variety in music and fun music to listen to whenever get this cd whether they are punk pop punk or pop rock they are good,1
kick ass pop punk catchy lyrics sick riffs and a band with a totally cool attitude this in my opinion is their best to date with their self titled in second and mo money mo NUMBER in third the only album from mest that i did not really like was wasting time but it still was not that bad,1

this is my second time purchasing this item i had an earlier model of this hot water dispenser for eleven years that one had a metal container which rusted out this newer version has a molded plastic type of water container which is definitely an improvement i love the addition of the temperature control which the old one did not have,1

hoping but no was hoping other reviews were off but unfortunately they were right not even close to a recommended movie or as would be said by submariners a true five finger gagger,0
NUMBER minutes gone from my life as we used to say in the submarine service you get a double punch on your hurter card for sitting through this how did they get dennis hopper to sign on for this one it looks like it was filmed with a camcorder during the semi nude scenes i found myself looking for holes in their underwear i will give it NUMBER stars since it was in color and had sound,0

singular work of genius arrives in fish wrap the greatest achievement in western literature is now available in a bound version heretofore reserved for second rate how to books from the remainder bin this publisher offers no preface foreword notes or so much as an illustrator credit for the apt cover the sole redeeming feature of this tawdry effort usually clocking in at NUMBER pages plus this version manages to squeeze every word of the masterwork into a nimble NUMBER pages thanks to a total lack of margin space or chapter breaks laughably the book spine does not allow even for this squeezed assembly so that it arrives splayed and bow legged in unintentional tribute to the willowy author perhaps under inked to the point of appearing mimeographed with serifs giving way on almost every page this is hardly the version one needs of a book to be cherished and re visited often,0
duplicates others typical straight from project gutenberg textfile conversion no toc no italics no chapter breaks see comparative review here ulysses,0
a masterpiece of english literature after finally summoning the courage to attempt a reading of ulysses i am profoundly greatful that i did while the novel is intricately layered and multi referenced reading it is really not as challenging as its reputation would have one believe moreover it is a page turner in the truest sense never before have i been so absorbed by a piece of literature joyce relentless and masterful descriptions of characters thoughts both important inner monologues and equally flippant patter offer an insight into the human condition which is unparalled in english literature i am utterly convinced that ulysses is the most important novel of the twentieth century it is a true masterpiece of literary art one that simply makes the reader proud to be human,1
i love it i am very satisfied and i like it i think the shipping cost is a little expensive for me because i do not live in usa anyway thank you mary christmas,1
habent sua fata libelli that book has a luck it the worst book which has ever been written strangely there are some people who think it is the best one that what the latin phrase above means,0
ulysses this book is a struggle i do not know where it going and can not decide if i want to be there at the finnish,0
not for me this being my first time reading joyce i did not really know what to expect after reading for a day or two i found that it was too scattered and hard to follow i do not think it would be right for me to say that i would not recommend it to anyone because i think it is worth a try i might come back to it in a few years but right now it just is not exactly my cup of tea,0
italics are capitalized substituting capitalization for italics is unacceptable also multiline verses are collapsed into one unbroken line,0
dirty and cheap can you make a cheaper case that these chips come in the case weighs about NUMBER oz and is ready to fall apart the fake felt they use disintegrates at touch leaving the chips dirty covered in some sort of micro fiber recycled paper dirt the chips themselves are ok without a reliable way to transport them this poker set is not worth much of course its made in china and you get what you pay for,0

high quality casino grade poker chip set casino quality chip set heavy duty case set is very heavy accounts for the high shipping charge,1
poor quality the quality of the case is poor it does not close well and there seems to be poor structural integrity of the case some of the chips are dirty or damaged somehow,0
these shows have all been edited all shows on this set are the edited versions each show is missing more than NUMBER minutes of footage the other set from this company is the same if you want the original un cut versions then skip these if you do not mind having missing footage then go for it personally i would rather not have something than have shows the way these are,0

there are better flash cartooning books out there in my opinion the only chapters worth reading are chapters NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER and NUMBER my biggest complaint about this book is that most of the chapters were boring chapter NUMBER shows an ostrich walk cycle chapter NUMBER shows fighting skunks and chapter NUMBER shows a talking grave i prefer flash NUMBER cartooning and flash cartoon animation learn from the pros over this book,0
is book true in the very first chapter the motion picture frame of war coverage on the roer river in germany it shows the dates NUMBER but the invasion of europe never happend until june NUMBER please explain,0
not just brokaw i was terrifically moved by this recording and tom brokaw was the least of it the supporting cast really throws themselves into the letters from the greatest generation nothing is hokey or excessive but the honest human sentiment is tough to resist by contrast tom brokaw sounds like he phoning in his part of the script but he has comparatively little to do here the heavy lifting is done by the professional narrator and actors a stunner it impossible to recommend this edition too highly,1
do not be fooled by the preview i saw the preview for this movie and thought it bepretty funny the napolean dynamite scene is one of thehighlights and that occurs in the first scene unfortunately it all downhill from there a big chunk of the movie isparodies of meet the parents and meet the fockers tryingto parody a classic comedy is like going to karaoke night andtrying to sing a celine dion song at best it tolerable worst case scenerio well you get the idea nowhere nearas funny as the scary movie movies,0
unrated i am tired of all these movies claiming to be the unrated version and not offering a single thing that would not be included without exception in a pg NUMBER movie add to that only seven or eight decent laughs in the whole movie and i am pretty ticked off explaining the spoofs would actually be funnier than the movie so i will not do it tried and true spoof formula is not properly hashed out in cheap attempt to cash in on quarter of a century craze airplane NUMBER top secret hot shot hot shot part deux and not another teen movie are much examples of this art form might have given it two stars if they left the unrated off the box a lot more of josh meyers might have helped,0
a very very bad movie i recently witnessed this car crash of a movie i usually like parodys but this movie was boring and unfunny,0
one of the worst out there date movie is from two of the six writers of scary movie apparently they chose the two worst because the movie fails to generate laughter a few chuckles here and there but that all date movie is a spoof of romantic comedies simply that idea sounds good right the writers had alot to work with but they failed miserably alyson hannigan plays the main character julia jones personally not a big fan of her comedy now eddie griffin jennifer coolidge and fred willard can be quite hilarious but none of that is portrayed in this flop this might be enjoyed by some but only a few for me a big comedy fan it was pretty bad in general i actually watched it at the theaters and my friends it was the biggest waste of ten dollars in my life it is now out on dvd and someone will have to pay me to watch it again ok maybe not pay me but at least pay for the movie one measly star,0
torture to watch i went to see this but it was not by choice i went on a field trip with my co workers and this was the movie that won the vote i am all for parodies like saturday night live but this movie went overboard so does all the scary movies i do not like these either do yourself a favor and skip this movie get yourself a real date movie,0
always laugh at these parody movies but not this one the movie was funny the first oh lets say about maybe the first NUMBER minutes after that the movie is garbage the humor and mocking was so dis tasteful and a little offensive the cat in the bathroom dead mrs jones the little jokes by the bachellor parents the bizarre family relationships and the mock sexual references to sex i was very surprised at myself when i viewed the film i hardly laughed and did not laugh when i needed like i said i totally love these not another teen movie scary movie type films but date movie is pure garage the humor is so awful and the mockery sucks toobottom line horrible movie never watching it again,0
dated and dull this is waaay before the age of personal trainers not only is their a small amount of bare skin but the bare skin they show ai not worth seein this stuff got better in the NUMBER s when there was ample supply of attractive and less inhibited women,0
worst movie in history where to start this thing is so bad that it is a disgrace to bad melodrama the plot is so predictable it is sickening this movie was not even released until after harry potter was released,0
great these are authentic ray ban aviator glasses and they look amazing on an average person face even though they say they are large the only thing i do not like it that the lens are not a non see through green depending on the lighting people can see your eyes this happens about of the time outside of that they are amazing glasses and look great,1
tony b new chairman of the board if sinatra was considered the chairman of the board tony babino will be considered president and ceo of the company from the opening chord of this cd you will be very very impressed with tony b powerhouse vocals he belts out the standard i have got the world on a string with a livelier arrangement to a heartfelt rendition of and i love her if you think he might be another cover artist you will be wrong tony b writes his own songs as well he wrote NUMBER of the NUMBER tracks on this cd some of his own compositions like NUMBER years and sentimental heartstrings are better than some standards this is a superb cd you will definitely without a doubt enjoy this cd as the title suggests you will be swingin around with tony b for a long time to come,1
fun family film i love cary grant and sophia loren in this fun movie the kids have an adventure living in a houseboat as opposed to living in an apartment in d c,1
houseboat this movie is a real delight it is better than i remembered it as a child my priorities were different this plays out as a predictable romantic comedy but great fun anyway no heavy plot here as grants housekeeper loren helps grant to change his priorities be less of a jerk and bond with his children this takes place on a leaky houseboat that sometimes breaks loose and floats down river grants dry humor and wit is great fun to watch loren is the italian beauty thought she was ugly when i was a child that falls in love with grant and brings the family together,1
a very meaningful and entertaining movie saw the bachelor in the cinema it did not fail to keep me smiling and laughing through the whole show it show that money really can not get you true love it is a guy sincerelyty that had touch the girl heart and at the last part of the movie when one whole bunch of brides chasing after the guy in the movie boy it was a real fancinating moment i ever seen never had i seen such phenomenon ever after all this is really a good movie to keep you entertain for two hours worth watching,1
not much redeeming value i do not mind implausible stories but only if the film makers can pull it off i was sad to discover that chris can not act i had not noticed before because he was well cast in a few other roles but fortunately never had to carry a story part of the problem might go to the director in fact the director is highly suspect the timing was off and there is no evidence that the man in charge had any clear view of what he wanted to bring out in the characters or storyline i was sorry i spent the money on the rental do not bother,0
difficult viewing this film is difficult to watch for many reasons it is below average both artistically and technically the film is a classic of its genre but for me husbands and woman under the influence are much better as films note how the excessive laughter in faces is annoying and unrealistic whilst in husbands it is natural and enjoyable,0
old protest music by an old hippy definitely not country music this is a compilation of songs published on other records it is still good writing a protest song was and is just country joe mcdonald s way of saying hello if you are interested in the NUMBER s or the vietnam war this is worth considering the most known song on this album the fixing to die rag is less raucous than the woodstock version of that song and still a good version with the advantage that i can play this one for the grand kiddies without their grandmother going ballistic for a long time this album was only available at great cost but now it has been republished at a reasonable price and is worth considering,1
sorry i bought it less than three months after purchase it in the shop an authorized repair center picture started snapping no more picture they replaced the picture tube and something else i took it home then it started displaying flickering white lights across the top of the screen and a vertical rectangular discoloration on the left side of the screen they have been working on it for a week,0
refund this has to be one of the worst movies i have seen what a waste of talent money one has to wonder what someone was thinking when this was made i could only stand to watch half of it do not waste your time money,0
hard to follow my husband and i watched this over the weekend we were both very lost for about the first NUMBER minutes finally we watched the trailer to see if it was worth watching the rest of it watching the trailer helped but not completely this is by far not our favorite movie of all time,0
coconutheads i have followed the coconutheads since the early nineties as they have performed throughout south florida their live performance would make a great album too val and greg have a have an almost telepathic connection on stage their saxophonist nicky i think is outrageous mixing in jazzy moody tones with great skill the band has had some personnel changes but the core members have stayed intact although i miss the live drummer,1
great product it the best lube i have used so far just a bit expensive and that the only thing wrong with it,1
good product stains can be dealt with i also found this to be a good product and also originally found it to stain any fabric it came in contact with however when i contacted pjur customer service they suggested i try oxiclean or a similar formulation that did in fact get out the stains,1
it is greasy i bought this because of the men health endorsement my wife and i used it a few times and then desisted it ok for intercourse but not other activities,0
there are better lubes by far we did not like this lube it was not slick enough for our purposes and was very watery there are much better lubes out there for the money it also stung per my wife so we will not try this again,0
love it i loved this movie i watched it in my english class and loved it it was soo beautiful and i had to buy it because it was so awesome you never get bored it has stuff for everyone in it whether you like romance action humor it is all in there i really enjoyed it,1
the definitive romeo juliet italian director franco zeffirelli did an outstanding job of bringing shakespeare romantic tale to life it is the definitive version of romeo juliet in my opinion the fact that the actors were so close to the age of the star crossed lovers adds realism and freshness to the story shakespeare words flow so naturally that you forget that it is a classic play and just get lost in the story the cinematography is beautifully done and the wonderful customes are a treat for the eyes you will enjoy this movie again and again i highly recommend it,1
romeo juliet love at first sight sure i only watched this because it was assigned for english but i ended up liking it most other NUMBER year olds do not like shakespeare but this is really good i liked that they had the orignal shakespearian language i have not seen the newer version of romeo juliet so i can not compare the two i really recommend this movie to anyone i sure would watch it again even if it was not mandatory it an instant classic and a must have for anyone you wil love this movie my parents love it too it brings back a lot of memories for them yes good ones all age groups would like this except maybe ones younger than my age group mid teens you will not regret getting or at least renting it so come on people give this a try enjoy,1
romeo juliet the only reason i watched this movie is because it was a required see from a class in college i was enrolled in,0
the fight over music holloway book is a wonderful introduction to what the history of western political philosophy says about the role of music in shaping people character the belief that music has a role in forming the character has always been a controversal stance starting with plato and remains one still today one only has to be reminded of allan bloom chapter on rock music and the reaction that section provoked shows how powerful this theme remains today liberals ancient and modern capitalist or not do not like the idea that music plays a role in character formation and what holloway book does shows the reader what the big stars of western philosophy has to say on this subject holloways argues by ignoring the power of music in the formation of character of the young especially contemporary society and the music it has bread has lead to extremes both in music and people character and both for the worse,1
but they are not on an airplane i was extremely disappointed with airplane ii the sequel the first one was great and i watch it over and over again but since i have seen the sequel it has not been as funny the sequel pretty unoriginal and the replayed humor detracts from its predessor it the same love story and a smattering of redone scenes rember the old woman who hung herself i would not buy this one in fact i would not even spend the money to rent it on dvd save yourself a few bucks rent it on vhs,0
more groans than laughs weak derivative and thoroughly unfunny classic example of a studio cashing in with the old good movie rehash although what funny and what is not is often a matter of opinion the element of surprise is what defines humor we laugh when the unexpected happens but having seen it all before in the original nothing and i mean nothing is funny in airplane NUMBER even the new jokes are variations on a theme save your money and watch airplane twice,0
strictly for seattle radicals all others need not apply this movie is in black and white better still in black and red and i do not mean colorwise it your standard politically correct hagiography where good guys ooze beatitude bad guys reek evil and if you do not root for the former you belong with the latter like history told this way if so then you are going to love it if not at least you will get some laughs mind you it not that i object the fake look dubbed dialogue hammy overacting or holier than thou attitude of everyone concerned in this dated political flick from the sixties i mean we were all pretty much ridiculous ourselves back then but joan baez awful lyrics and worst wailing tear apart the movie only redeeming asset ennio morricone beautiful music score now that a true crime so you have been warned,0
a spark for social reform the purpose of this book is to heighten awareness about consumerism and ultimately bring about dramatic change in our society the audience is primarily americans though the book has been well received in several foreign countries de graaf and his associates present powerful evidence from a wide collection of sources their argument is persuasive and well documented they address environmental social financial spiritual physical and mental indicators of health in our society affluenza has made me more aware of how i spend my money time and intellectual effort by highlighting some of our societies weaknesses i enjoyed reading the book because it made me question some of my practices the authors throw down the gauntlet by challenging many american principles overall the argument is sound and effective if a bit dramatic at times a copy of should come free with every new bmw satellite tv dish and mba degree america needs it,1
love this movie i love that i can find the older movies here at amazon i have bought several from different sellers and all have been great i just love spenser tracy and this old b w is one of my fav,1
not just borderline terrible it is terrible thank your lucky star if you miss this one this movie is so bad i do not know where to start i do not like madonna to begin with it bad enough that i have to hear her belt out her crappy pop ditties on the radio and see her face plastered on magazine covers but this so called movie is quite possibly the worst thing she unleashed on the public it even worse than body of evidence and that saying something maybe i am prejudiced against madonna but i was willing to give this movie a chance boy do i regret it i want my two hours back,0
madonna is an embarrassment this movie is so very bad on so many different levels that it is almost beneath any serious movie lover or critic to waste time viewing it madonna is at her all time low and it is a low that few stars ever reach she is a terribly bad actress and this time out she made even her die hard fans cringe in embarassment for her simply put there is no guesswork here there is not a redeaming quality in this movie the acting script direction tone pace etc are all at an extremely shoddy level and damn is she getting painful to look at the only comfort comes in the knowledge of the fact that this movie was completely shunned by not only critics but by the public as well even madonna legion of fans could not get her out of this one it bombed on every level,0
great movie but the storyline was superb rupert was great but madonna what were you thinking her accent annoyed me throughout the whole movie is she american is she english the cross between sounds australian which is irritating apart from madonna terrible acting this movie is held together pretty well,1
bad the video kept timing out the screen would go black or multi color i had to wait for the movie to restart every NUMBER minutes,0
an amazing fun mom book this book was wonderful i am a sahm i thought that meredith did an excellent job on the book i loved all the relationships and the e mails going back and forth what a refreshing format this was not just a fun book though it was deep and caused me to think deeper about my life and my relationships with my husband kids and other moms i read this book in about a day it was too good to put down shannon,1
not the planet of the apes this has everything to do with the recent movie and nothing to do with the real book the real book had messages that were really lost in the recent film it was close to a modern day gulliver travels raising questions about how we treat animals our science and our society this will no doubt be fairly close to the recent film which is okay hokum excepting the massive holes in the plot of the recent movie how did horses arrive on the planet where were the non chimps on the station etc,0
wonderful perspective shift after reading the ophelia books and the studies on the many and varied problems teenage girls face this was a wonderful and refreshing perspective teenage girls who are self confidant not worried about pleasing others with who they are eloquent etc how encouraging i am looking forward to reaping some of these benefits of homeschooling,1
do not even remember watching it could not have been very good whoever created this should find another career best of luck,0
horrible waste of time this book is one of the worst books i have ever read none of the research from the bible is even remotely close to the context it was written in can katz even do a reasonable job at researching information it does not even deserve one star,0
women leave for all the same reasons i was not looking for a book on why men leave but on the fear of commitment i have enjoyed this author other book about zen and falling in love and browsing the first pages intrigued me i will never understand why anyone thinks this is just a masculine problem i think that certain people for whatever reason value their own personal freedom above anything else yet everyone of course would like to have a loving partner to go through life with i wish this book had more insight into how two people like this male female whatever can find freedom within the confines of relationship,0
do not bother wait for it to play on local cable i loved the first mummy movie and had very high expectations for the second even though i missed it in the theaters the day it was released on dvd i ran out to get it to find my local store sold out my roomate however manged to snag it for his collection and upon watching it that nite was glad that fate stopped me from buying a truly overrated summer popcorn flick special effects were a plenty but def less striking than the first one the computerized scorpion king at the end was almost as bad as the computerized satan at the end of spawn the story was kinda weak but its a sequel i guess do not waste your time rental only or wait for it on tnt,0
pretty bad if you loved the first one this one might be worth a rent from the video store but i thought that they were both pretty bad,0
this should have been a good movie but it really was not the returning characters display none of the character traits that made them entertaining in the first movie the movie simply careens in a nearly plot free fashion from one set piece of computer enhanced combat to another now i like a good violent action movie as much as the next guy but this one was not good watching it reminded me of watching somebody play the mortal kombat type video games of the NUMBER if the producers had spent half of what went toward special effects on a better script this movie could have lived up to its predecessor,0
the mummy returns i enjoyed the movie very much although some of the computer bad guys were a bit over the top the fact that oded fehr ardeth bay has more scenes helped alot this film is entertaining and also answers many questions left over from the NUMBER st film,1
forgot to mention this but universal did at the very least included dts to this blu ray as well as the first movie by the way this movie on the whole was not very good and was a bit way too campy,0
the mummy returns i find it very hard to believe that some people enjoyed this movie so much that they gave it a five star rating if this gets five stars what do good films get this makes no sense the film is poor hre are a few thoughts acting i have seen better acting in fifth grade musicals plot plot what plot dialog laughable character development the characters are so static that i felt like i was watching a soap opera set in NUMBER s egypt in which many things arbitrarily exploded i will praise this film in one way it is better than hollow man but then again sitting in an empty parking lot watching a dumpster for NUMBER minutes is more satisfying than watching hollow man in closing my solemn hope is that the mummy will not return again,0
ryan hickneys mummy review this moview could of been much better it was as dumb as dumb can get the only good thing about it is that the actors played good i am sure the director was feeling low when he found the rating in the theaters bye,0
do not buy this dvd unless you want to line universal pocket i advise you to stay away from this video do not get me wrong though i like the movie it pretty good escapist entertainment i do not try to read to much into such movies it was fun but universal is most likely going to release this title in an ultimate edition package just like the last one they also created ultimate editions for american pie meet joe black and a few others so if you like this movie wait for the ultimate edition,0
great special effects great photography and outstanding special effects a move to see over and over just to enjoy the visual presentation,1
it stunk this movie isnt even worth rental everthing was boring and the mummy was fully regenerated in the first NUMBER minutes it wasnt evenworth the one star it got,0
what a waste of time this refers to the australian region NUMBER collector edition the picture quality is excellent the dts soundtrack yes this is standard on the r NUMBER dvd unlike the r NUMBER is of reference quality and quite outstanding in dynamic range especially in the water wall sequence unfortunately the film was a total waste of time and i think studios should be paying audiences to watch films like this no where near as good as the original very formulaic and it felt almost like a cartoon with its over reliance on cgi i scanned through most of the movie and i feel sorry for everyone who thinks this is worth buying even if a free copy was offered i would not accept because i would never watch it again and the bonus materials who cares about this when the film is so pathetic i hope i am not a minority who thinks film substance is still more important than its technical merits i have invested in home theatre to enjoy films not gunfire car chases and explosions,0
good short history publisher wilson creek national battlefield foundation NUMBER th edition NUMBER language englishasin NUMBER NUMBER pages maps pictures indexi found this book in the bookstore at wilson creek and bought it immeadlty ed bearss narration captures the immediacy of the situation placing you on the line this small book will not disappoint the reader there and will convey solid information about the battle the balance between detail and narration is maintained throughout the book neither takes over and we end with a short but very solid history,1
ok as a monocular not a binocular i could not get these to form a single image of a star or planet because the two tubes are not exactly parallel i do not know whether that was a quality control issue of the pair i had or the overall quality specification is so poor that misalignment is typical mine went back a properly aligned pair would be a considerable bargain if you buy these buy them from a place with a good return policy keep the packaging and invoice,0
re mission impossible by and large the movie fails because it strays too far from the premise of the tv show and ventures into NUMBER and bourne territory no imf team no suspense poor story the tv series is far superior,0
impossible your impossible misson trying to watch this movie and finding anything comprehensible about the plot tom cruise said in an interview that it is possible to follow the plot but obviously there is a problem if he has to point that out but does that mean one has to rewind certain sections five times to get all the dialogue details movies are not like books in theaters you can not flip back five pages to refresh in your mind who a certain character is so things should be spelled out with clarity something this film is woefully lacking having said that depalma is a great stylist director and as a music video this is not a total loser but as a movie it is,0
such shit this movie is the worst of modern movie making big budget small art i could not wait for it to be over,0
i was dissappointed fans of the tv series should be dissappointed and angry that a good show has gotten into the wrong hands there is none of the intrigue or ingenuity that was so integral to the series the movie could have and should have been made under a different title why was it necessary to spoil the memory of a great tv series with this nonsense without revealing any of the plot let me just say that the denouement is particularly awful in that it puts one of the main characters from the tv show in a very negative light this particular plot element was completely unnecessary and un called for no reason to see this at all,0
nice family drama this is a nice family drama that explores a son conflicted relationship with his father it shows the sad consequences that result when father spend much time trying to become rich and famous and calously neglect to care for and love their sons,1
get this book and go the people guide is a pure delight a labor of love about mexico it a travel book that is actually fun to read it also full of useful information about just about everything how to travel where to stay how to stay healthy how to deal with the law some basics on the language and much more and every bit of it feels like advice from someone who has learned it all through years of experience some of it painful most of it joyful what it is not is a book listing all the hotels restaurants stores museums and so forth there is a short section the best of mexico with specific suggestions but it just a starting point if your approach to travel is as footloose and unplanned as the authors this may be the only book you need if you like a little more structure you will want to supplement it with traditional guidebooks for the areas you plan to visit,1

brittle fail these cases are super brittle i bought one recently from this seller and in the past on ebay in both instances the cases have been tough fits the cases are super brittle and will more than likely crack on you while screwing them on like mine did i am pretty upset at the cost of them for how cheap they are i now have a nice transparent case with a huge crack down the middle and a dvd drive that will not open not worth it,0
just what i was looking for this book is full of many wonderful ideas on how to achieve your own space the effect is fresh and romantic and somehow soothing the images within are simply elegant lovely and highly recommended,1

wing fly high love this cd to bad it was the last wings recored all were gems the lp did not far good on release but it was still great,1
yes it is better of all mccartney lost albums this is the one that most richly deserves to be found old siam sir sits with other forgotten mccartney classic rockers such as girls school soily and the mess all of which fit neatly with the best rock and roll he wrote for that other group in many ways they are rawer than most of what he wrote for them arrow through me is one of those delicate pieces that mccartney writes that somehow manage to rock in a subtle way the rockestra highlights work well on this album but are perhaps better on concert for kampuchea the generally stripped down sound of this album allows the listener to appreciate the musicianship of wings mark NUMBER give it a listen you want be disappointed particularly if you like the better moments on the mccartney album,1
excellent all the nancy drew books are excellent perfect to develop a NUMBER or NUMBER year olds love for reading the stories are all so interesting we cherish our mother daughter routine of reading these books together every night also the characters are wholesome there is a line drawn between good and evil some of the more contemporary books like junie b jones have main characters that i would never want my daughter to emulate with bad attitudes etc nancy drew is not afraid of anything or anyone and is always finding adventure while solving mysteries,1
story of saab as told by a european the author has several automotive books to his credit and it shows in his history of this classic car told from a british perspective the text is easy to read and the author displays a thorough understanding of how cars work there are plenty of excellent photos some in color but mostly not i learned why the ignition key is on the floor safety feature and got further insights into this small company heritage as an innovator e g how with the NUMBER they had an extremely aerodynamic car rivalled only by the citroen ds or how they insisted for safety reasons on using heavier sheet metal than other makers explaining its enduring status among automotive brands,1
disturbing we received this book as a gift i like the photo illustration concept but the book content itself is disturbing there are so many better books out there to spend your money on,0
beware this is not an appropriate book for children as a child i myself found it highly disturbing although the pictures are cute i would never allow my child to read it,0
magic thumb tip the thumb is very small more for a child than an adult and you could not fit any cloth inside to do any type of trick would absolutely not recommend this product at all,0
meooooooooww when i read this title i thought it was going to be a funny story but wowww was it so much more this is the sexiest story i have every read dammmmmm,1
a classic which keeps you guessing the only thing really wrong with morse is that he smokes too much if you want a really good read in your mysteries here it is,1
cute i used them to decorate a cake i used these to decorate my boyfriend birthday cake i have to admit they were a bigger hit than my cake lol,1
yes good movies are still being made with today current crop of movies it is easy to think that quality films that make you think might have gone the way of the dodo however the insider is a big exception to the rule do not let the long running time or the fact that it may seem like any other a e documentary discourage you this movie is potboiler that keeps you glued to the screen and howling at every the injustice of it all one of the greatest compliments for this movie would have to be the fact that i watched it with five of my friends who could care less about current events or journalistic integrity yet all of them sat through every single minute of it absolutely riveted to the screen it is kind of discouraging seeing the self censorship and the chilling effect on the media that taken place since the events of the film however the film ends on a high note and is well worth watching if you enjoy great cinema,1
great suspensful drama this is a great movie starring russell crowe and al pacino it was well worthy of it oscar nomination for best picture the movie builds with tension as the it moves along the dvd has some great features and great picture quality the movie is over NUMBER hours but as with any great film time is not an issue this is well worth the money to buy,1
the best i sometimes think of that final list of the finest movies i have ever seen after much soul searching and viewing films for over NUMBER years i narrowed it down to amadeus private ryan manchurian candidate frank sinatra high noon and no country after everything shakes out the insider would have to top the list acting directing music script and subject matter i just wish it was on blu ray,1
riveting man was i upset when this thing ended after just three hours for anyone who ever worked in a big glass skyscraper this film is truly cathartic i think it is too narrow to focus on the journalistic or the tobacco industry elements of the insider like heat before it mann film is a highly dramatized portrayal of ethics in the modern world truly a remarkable film that earns everything it asks for from the audience on a lesser note i also think it is something really unique when big budget hollywood productions such as this one eschew explosions and spaceships to focus on telling a human story cheesy as it may sound i believe a film like this is much closer to gargantuan filmaking than well let us justs say gladiator,1
pretty much a waste of time the story itself which is based on real events is interesting but the filmmakers made it into a weak feature film there is too much unnecessary information and the NUMBER minutes peoples portrayal is too harsh some scenes are repeated during the film and the overall dialogue can at times put you to sleep i give this film two stars instead of one because of russel crowe superb acting,0
not what i expected this books has loads of information but it is in black and white and the fonts make it difficult to hold one attention i would not purchase this again,0
to dream of love this movie is unique and beautiful especially the character tom played by jeremy davies still reeling from its beauty which really was in all the little details it was made like a dream some characters over the top some more real than real see it if you can,1
the emperor has no clothes too bad there is not a rating of minus stars this film is garbage boring pretentious and meaningless perhaps other reviews can attach their own fantasies and for them this doa film may say something but i found it an irritating waste of time when a script and the characters within it have no definition no relevance and no entertainment value watching it becomes either self torture or an exercise in pretending that it serves some arty vision this is the only time that mel gibson let me down i understand he donated his services to this production and in that case he was very much overpaid,0
great buy great hair and skin i bought this for myself and upon using it just once the difference in my skin and hair was obvious no itching or dryness i promptly bought another for my mother she is in her NUMBER s and has said this has helped her skin and hair so much we gave them as gifts to many people in NUMBER and every one of them has gone on to buy one to give as a gift to someone they love too honestly easy to install easy to use instant results great value for money,1
my philips norelco epilator i was really pleased after using my new epilator it definitely exceeded my expectations and i do not need to epilate again for at least a month easily i had a braun epilator earlier i had used for years which was much more expensive but i must say the philips epilator is as good if not better,1
awsome i love this product it awsome i have to admit it is painful a little the first time but after that the pain goes away you will love the feeling of your skin after you use it very smooth and clean i totally recommend it,1
first epilator i have used i am not sure how this compares to other epilators but i think it does a pretty good job for the price it does not get all my hair out but it gets NUMBER of it after a few passes i think with any epilator it going to hurt but since the hair does not grow back as fast and comes back finer it is sooo worth it the more you use it the less it hurts so do not give up it gets better also i have noticed that even with occasional use about NUMBER times a year about NUMBER of my hair has stopped growing back and what has come back is much finer unfortunately i have such fair skin that i need to remove the hair either by epilating or waxing since you can still see the folicle after shaving the epilator is much more financially and environmentally better than having to wax for me,1
looking for the perfect gift for the man who has everything here it is i purchased this for my dad NUMBER years young finding anything for him that he has not seen heard or done is very difficult imagine my surprise when he sent me a note stating this was the best gift he received in a long time i also bought him the evolution of useful things same message both are super duper gifts,1
to engineer is human i engineered a new beverage coaster i purchased this book at the duke university bookstore after the recommendation from a professor at another institution petroski prose is extremely dense and verbose his style consists of run on sentences which require several readings even if it is technically grammatically correct it is extremely difficult to read the subject matter is dry to begin with however petroski does nothing to liven it i am an engineer also and am not threatened by the technical information admittedly lifted from his students term papers i have chemical engineering textbooks that read like a novel hopefully the courses he teaches are clearer than this muddled prose petroski is certainly an engineer he has engineered an elegant method of making money from saps like us i successfully engineered petroski book into a beverage coaster to help drown the sorrows of wasting NUMBER on this book,0
save yourself the time the book itself was in good condition and promptly shipped however the content of the book leaves a lot to be desired what could have been accomplished in one chapter is drawn out repeatedly to cover NUMBER pages very boring overall message is one of merit but too much repetition,0
had so much potential i tried really hard to like this book the first couple of chapters were really promising but then the author suddenly lost track of where she was going stilted broken part way descriptive sentences no serious romance going on i really did not care if they ended up together i suggest karen marie moning for really great time travel romance or for the serious time travel enthusiast diana gabaldon outlander both authors have never written a dud this was definitely a dud no offense intended to the author of course it just did not happen,0
i liked the backcover blurb but this book was romantic drivel it made me think it was pulled directly from the pages of an early NUMBER s harlequin while wonderful at the time this book will leave today modern romance reader cold latter day saints this is a book you can sink your teeth into,0
do not waste your money although they appeared to be working they glowed and we hear the occasional zap it did not take NUMBER months before one of them completely stopped glowing and they made no dent at all in the mosquito population the reason we bought them not worth it at all,0
bug zapper i was hoping for something with more power to actually zap the bugs but this one does not i even purchased two sets the light does cause the bugs to swarm around it but it does not have enough power to actually kill the bugs when it is on the light setting it is not enough light to even guide you along a path i am very disappointed in it we will be purchasing an electric bug zapper soon to replace these,0
poor stitching does not hold up i recently purchased NUMBER of these bras and although i loved the fit i am afraid that NUMBER out of NUMBER have had an identical problem in stitching at the center top part of the bra all of them have unraveled stitching during the first wash causing the underwire to poke out all were hand washed and were hung to dry so i am afraid it can not be blamed on machines i am greatly disappointed,0
works with avic d NUMBER the new ipods do not charge with the pioneer cable and this was the solution to the problem now my NUMBER th gen nano charges no problem,1
NUMBER NUMBER stars still good this is not like their first two albums but it still heavy they do not have the deathcore they had in their first album and some of it in caitiff choir but it still has the metalcore with brutal breakdowns and more melodic singing i guess this is kind of like the band a day to remember just not to big with the pop thing if you own their first two albums just know this there more clean singing nick does not have the deathcore growls anymore and not as brutal but yeah still brutal so i can not say you might not like this but there is some good heavy songs is okay,1
so far tr s bon as described but i think you need to know some french before you can use this product effectively,1
is it over yet after NUMBER months of trying to plow through this book i finally gave up on page NUMBER and read the last page i kept hoping things would get better the pace would pick up and i might care about these people to no avail a thourough disappointment start to abbreviated finish,0
crap with all the add on to this game a simple versus dlc that allows you to play up to four or even two players in your house split screen would be good but no they made it online only or one player so no internet no fun it not worth it buy any other burnout except this one and if you want to have fun wreaking cars and people get saints row the third or grand theft auto you can drive around getting into all sorts of trouble not a bad idea the open land driving but we see that in the gta this is burnout the open land should be the addition,0
you are going to this book this book is a must read but not unless you have read city of masks and city of stars hoffman creates and incredible world in unfortunately the last installment of this amazing series you will want to stay in talia forever this book had the perfect combination of love adventure suspense and wit for those of you who read the first NUMBER books to me city of flowers was very shocking but in a good way,1
we are the world meets journey when the cast of we are the world and the band members of journey had illegitimate children they named them doug and the mystics doug and the mysics successfully create prozaic induced songs about what seem to be important issues later these songs proove to have no real central concept or meaning,0

faith in this movie nortan fight club american history x elfman sitcom dharma and greg and stiller meet the parents light it up in this warm hearted comedy about NUMBER friends from grade school who have not seen each other in year now thrown back together when elfman comes running back into their lives nortan and stiller now clergymen nortan a catholic priest stiller a jewish rabbi both find the old friendship they once knew in their beloved tom boyish beauty of a friend elfman but throughout it all there is denial lying antitrust and a passionate love triangle forms now who will end up following their faith and who will end up following their hearts nortan elfman and stiller deliver a spectacular and heart gripping performance in this romantic comedy that should not be missed by men nor women alike,1
sweet romantic comedy ben stiller and edward norton play best friends jake and brian a rabbi and a priest who are both strong leaders in their congregations when their friend anna visits them both friends fall for her and find themselves questioning their faiths this is a sweet and often funny movie that is well written and acted by the cast religion can be a tough subject to base a comedy around but keeping the faith does pretty well the plot itself seems to unwind a bit near the end but ben stiller and edward norton keep it afloat pretty well this is a pretty good movie so i recommend it for a saturday afternoon,1
love it this has always been one of my favorite movies it is one of my favorite roles for all of the actors especially edward norton but they all did beautifully it was refreshing to see ben stiller in a more serious yet still comedic movie,1
a good collection but this collection features some of their hit singles plus one new track desperado it includes the NUMBER single in italy movin on which was originally released in NUMBER the beautiful ballads dreamland paradise leaving now and smile and the amazing excessive love all the other tracks are pop dance songs they did many other songs that are not included here as the pop jazz broadway the beautiful semi new age ballad shine and many others,1
after NUMBER years i finally saw this film again and it was not too bad though typical of the time it came out as far as sound photography spfx and acting though the four leads were great randy quaid the beautiful kate capshaw this was only her second film max von sydow and of course christopher plummer it arrived from amazon just days before eddie albert died but i did not get around to watching it till a few days after that so it was kinda bittersweet to watch i could barely recall anything of it since i seen it only once at its initial theatrical release so this was a nice reminder i recommend this to anyone looking for NUMBER minutes to kill if they have nothing else to do unintentional funny moment when the paramedics try reviving a dead mrs matusik the actress moves a split second before the paddles touch her,1
suprisingly enjoyable blow is a well done film depicting an era though the point of blow is kind of hard to figure out it is an interesting movie to watch and you find yourself mysteriously rooting for jung as he rises and falls the best part of this film is the first part detailing jung rise to fame and his doomed relationship with his first girlfriend the shots of california and the beach are the quintessential way that we all wish it truly were somewhat depressing somewhat amusing and always entertaining you will not go wrong adding blow to your collection depp is always good in all his roles,1
depp could not save this one this film portrays large scale drug dealers as guerilla marketing experts it long on make up and period costume and short on cool dialogue or good acting hispanic actors portray columbians using exaggerated accents and they appear more middle eastern than latin american good cameos by ray liotta and pee wee herman the film is based on one convict memoir and it presents an interesting point or two but everything in this film has been covered before in better films,0
great movie i really liked this movie they picked the perfect character for pee wee herman to play i thought the movie was really good except for the constant whinning of his mother what about me what about me get really old after awhile listening to her complain otherwise i thought it was a great movie johnny depp was real convincing as a drug dealer my suggestion by this movie,0
crime does not pay no honor among thieves a very good life lesson based on a true story the story is interesting and engaging from the beginning till the end it a very good life lesson based on a true story it showed a big drug dealer can make tons of money however it also shows crime does not pay and there is no honor among thieves they set up each other they stole from each other etc it absolutely worth viewing,1
heavy handed while the acting directing and general storytelling was solid i thought the movie was little more than a heavy handed morality play disguised as a self indulgant biographical expos truth is i just did not find the characters interesting or sympathetic and the ending made me groan they probably got funding from the us government to present the anti drug moral lesson,0
hogan halo hailed on by this half witted horror the first two films were wonderful fun and worth repeat viewing i only managed to sit in the theater until the end of this one by mustering great fortitude compared to the first two episodes los angeles is lamentably lame skip it,0
please no more the third installment of crocodile dundee starring a subdued paul hogan takes place this time in los angeles where he somehow finds an plot do steal some paintings the ever lovable guy from is less lovable and more pathetic looking this go around i know he getting older but did this second sequal really need to be made the script and plot are something not even a t v movie of the week would show like the old saying do not fix it if it aint broken well it broken but please hollywood do not try and fix it,0
not the buddy holly i know and love my husband bought this cd for me during a recent visit to the uk and i do not like it i am a buddy holly fan but sound quality is poor and it does not compare to his later recordings in terms of arrangements and singing style not my cup of tea,0
pathetic movie feels like a made for tv movie rent it first this movie literally borrows scenes from many action movie it is full of plot holes the story is ok the dvd has ok amount of features rent this pathetic movie first unless you like treat williams or b grade action movies i would go into details about the many plot holes but that would ruin it for other readers viewers just be sure you rent this movie first before you buy it,0
amazing camus novel truley symbolizes the coldness of modern life he creates one of the great literary characters of all time and paints a powerful image of mankind true state the novel makes the reader question their own lapse into the existentialist circle and why it happens in short it is one of the classics,1
read it for your own reaction this novel is absurd this is not arguable the point of this novel is that you react to it you see meursault and his absurd way of going about life and you feel the need to change your own,1
profound poetic and disturbing a terrific read very dry engaging and clips along at a good pace i finished it in less than three hours and felt that i had witnessed part of myself on camus stage m meursault is for the most part an ordinary person who has been benumbed by a daily existence of getting by finding himself so dulled that finally he is a mere spectator in his own life effect instead of cause the story begins with a death and ends with a death in the folds of each is found new life whether it is his maman fiancee or meursault own rebirth of consciousness in his final minutes perhaps through this story we can all find something of ourselves in m meursault and heed the warning that seems to glare in mile high neon be cause not effect get out and live live heroically instead of being a spectator or simply getting by quot,1
the stranger i picked up the stranger expecting the worst with a sigh i sat down to read it and about an hour later i put it down i sighed again shrugged and then ate lunch at dinner i told my father that i had finished reading it and my reaction to the text he grinned and waved his fork that exactly what camus was writing about confused i read the book again and this time i liked it the more i read it the easier it was to understand i felt connected to the characters and sympathized with the events in thier lives the stranger nows has a special space in my bookcase,1
a good classic i think everybody should read this who likes existentialism it is a very quick read though i think it would make a very great movie,1
goth background research and the stranger the killing of an arab it was those lyrics in killing an arab by the cure that made me want to read this book plus in high school i thought i was an existentialist this story is really interesting and a great book to read if you are at all into the cure it like adding some street cred or something not really but i feel somehow more orderly by having read it it short easy to read and gives an interesting view of life it is written by quite a well known ie accessible philosopher after all one could call it a nice intro to existentialism or an addition to your goth music research cuz you know you love to research music,1
so overrated this is a top contender for the worst book ever written i thought about giving it a tied position with pamela anderson star but upon reflection i have decided that i would rather read star again than read the stranger again although i would rather be eaten alive by rabid wolverines than do either this book is so bad that it is painful for me to read it if i had a time machine i would pay to have camus beaten to death on a deserted beach ultimately preventing this disaster from ever coming into existence,0
not existentialist depressed i read the stranger when i was young but did not really get much out of it i recently reread it and was struck by the lack of emotion on the part of the protagonist muersault forget existentialist this man was depressed he has all the hallmarks of it does not care about anything has no joy in his existence it does not so much bother me that he did not care about his mother death she was older apparently not in good health and they were not close but what does bother me is the casual way he deals with the murder he committed it seems almost beside the point the man he killed had done nothing to muersault justifying the murder more than anything else his flat attitude reminded me of the murderers in in cold blood there were some serious mental health issues that this man had,1
existentialism at its finest the stranger was a summer reading assignment for my senior year of high school and i devoured every word of it albert camus should be read by every student of literature history and philosophy his prose is fluid his style uncompromising he reflects the lack of definite meaning that life sometimes has camus earned his place in the french literary canon it is time that the american literary canon adds him among their elite as well i hope to read this novel again but in french,1
great book i could not put it down after you get a few chapters into the book it grabs you you get so into it that every time you put it down all you can think about is the book this was also one of those books that your sad when it ends because you want to read more of it good thing there is NUMBER more this is a must read for all fantasy and science fiction readers,1
good cd dictionary that can be better this review is for cd version i agree with most of previous reviewers that this is top notch american english dictionary some previous reviewers complained that the new words are not inserted into the main body of the dictionary this could be a problem for the printed version for cd version this is not a problem when looking up a word i can not tell if it is from the original or from the new word list i do not understnad why the multimedia function is not on the cd if it uses too much hard disk space it can be made available from cd as random house did no pronouncing symbols can compare with the real sound,1
no support for low screen res the interface may be horrific or it may be brilliant either way i would not know as that i am running on a laptop with a vertical resolution of NUMBER dpi when running at this resolution the bottom of the dialogue boxes are chopped off scroll bars lists of words et al instead of resizing as would be expected of even a sub par user interface and tech support response to my dilemma increase your resolution sorry it a laptop with a fixed resolution not an option guess i am stuck with encarta less than inspiring definitions of words,0
excellent dictionary i found this dictionary outstanding quality as a person who english is not a first language i love the unlimited variety words and the detailed descriptions of each words i hoped if the book is not so big and heavy but i guess it impossible for this dictonary i like to recommend to evrybody and i have so for new buyers you will not regret people might think this dictionary is not much different from the oxford but this is quiet an extraordinary,1
not the worse film or acting but definately not the best or even above average why does kidman have to inhale rapidly like that after she finishes a sentence referring her private video segments is not she a trained actress that has learned breath control i understand she wanted to protray a psycho ditz but anyway i watched it to the end i guess mostly because it was based on a true story,0
fame is so important it is not really my sort of movie but it turned out to be a real winner it is a story of a woman who wants to be famous at all costs she ends out having her husband murdered and then overall it made me think i thought it was well acted particularly by kidman the film was well filmed worth seeing,1
a train wreck this film really misses its mark billed as a black comedy it fails to deliver any satirical bite whatsoever suzanne stone frequent video segments where she speaks directly to the camera and the flashforwards to some sort of jerry springer like show are painful to watch yeah nicole kidman is extremely sexy duh but it not nearly enough to overcome her marginal acting the clumsy dialog and the amateurish direction see this movie for all the humor of dying young coupled with the social commentary of a spongebob episode,0
NUMBER star presentation of a NUMBER star movie sony image lied this is apropos of the dvd version this movie is pan and scan despite what the description says and what it says on the back of the box it is NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER format and even says at the beginning of the film this film has been modified from its original format it has been formatted to fit this screen if you got stung demand a refund what nitwit would release a film in an obsolete format,0
what a pity thankfully i only paid money for this cd single the original edit is the only decent version on the cd and that only goes for NUMBER minutes why do they pay dj to remix these songs when the remixes are awful and the original in infinitely better i think dj have stopped trying and just put out any rubbish for cd fillers my advice would be do not buy this until you have listened to it first,0
can we escape our past this is the central question explored by conrad in lord jim jim is ultimately a character who inspires our sympathy due to his inability to find reconcilliation for his one tragic moment of weakness in him we find a person of tremendous potential that remains unrealized as the tragic circumstances of his abandoning his post aboard the patna continually haunt him and the associated guilt drives him to isolation conrad successfully explores the concepts of bravery cowardice guilt and the alternative destinies that an individual may be driven to by these qualities the narrative can be a bit confusing at times as marlowe relates the tale by recalling his encounters with jim the book reminded very much of somerset maugham the razor s edge in style however i believe that maugham did a much better job of incorporating the narrator into the flow of the story overall lord jim is a wonderful classic novel that i highly recommend,1
a little hard to follow for a timeless classic perhaps it is the nineteenth century writing style or the nautical terminology but the pronoun laced conversational passages have left me wondering who was on first or who was the first mate conrad was a pathbreaker in the subjects he treated and no doubt had interesting experiences but i prefer his other works,0
could not finish it ugh this might have been a good book if it were half the size but conrad strains to keep the plot going amid the endless descriptions of sea sky and the characters states of mind move along move along this ancient icon may be a monument to conrad mastery of his second language and it may be a tragic psychological exploration of the universal heroic destiny or something equally dense but listening to it does not exactly keep you on the edge of your seat,0
a great work of art this book works on so many levels it mind boggling it an adventure story it a philosophical novel of ideas it got brilliant use of language like a painter conrad creates effects by deciding what to put in and what to leave out he shifts narrators and fractures the time sequence to get maximum impact from his story if you do not get it the first time try again i have read it many many times it pure poetry and a genuinely profound book the review below from va that describes conrad theme facing your fears is totally right on the money so face your fears about reading a difficult book buy a copy of lord jim and read it and you will be a better person for the experience,1
exquisite how many of us read night flight in high school as quickly as possible my grown experience of saint exupery is the opposite i linger over every page saint exupery provides a literary meal to be savored page by page call me an escapist but the skies over buenos aires never looked so good,1
long winded sand and stars there one good chapter a good story about survival otherwise the pretentious frenchman force feeds the reader his personal philosophy through a superfluous writing style his name matches his style long winded and pretentious,0
why i was definitely turned on by all of the hype before the movie the commercial previews left me with much anticipation ll jada vivica fox whoopi i could not wait then i saw the movie what happened how could they have all of those folks in there and have that movie turn out that way all i can really say is that i was truly disappointed and i do not know who was at fault i have seen all of these people in other productions so i know they can act was it the director the producer now here a good question toni braxton was in the movie right so why in the world would they have jada up there acting like she was singing i can not go on,0
looks and feels too cheap to give as a gift i bought this for my brother for his birthday but i had to return it because i was to embarrassed to give it to him the dice have rounded edges so you can not use them for gambling the cards are very cheap so you would also swap those out for your own basically you buy this just for the travel case and the chips well the case i received was rusted yes a brand new case out of the box had rust on the handle and the closure buckles i returned it,0
must be made in china i purchased this for my step daughter who is a poker novice i thought she would like to have her own poker set to play and practice one week after receiving it she informed me that the set already began falling apart the hinge came off and it literally falling apart on her this was embarrassing because it was a gift from me now i must redeem myself and purchase a better set do not buy this piece of junk,0
cute but poor quality these are charming little espresso cups but they do not hold heat for more than NUMBER or NUMBER minutes granted we live in a cold climate so our house is usually cool but one ought not have to drink a cup of espresso in NUMBER minutes before it cools off also the cup itself gets quite hot if one happens to touch it while using the handle best to give to your daughter for a toy,0
this book is thorough but poorly written it is ironic that an account of the steely dan phenomenon is documented by someone whose writing skills are negligable becker and fagen two contemporary literary masters by most standards would find it strangely fitting i suppose sweet saving grace is his penchant for detail his tome has the stories for which every avid dan fan hungers recording sessions writing sessions band reformulations personal melodramas etc these elements make it enjoyable reading especially when accompanied by revisitations to the legendary recordings listening to the cd while making one chronological journey through this book is distictly thrilling as well as eye ear opening the lack of an index and of footnotes limits this volume usefulness as a reference source however it would be nice to see a similar effort made by a writer who posesses a similar creative energy quirkiness and skill to that of becker and fagen themselves,1
re releasing an evening with john denver under a different title if you already own an evening with john denver five star album then you do not need this one the same program exactly has been repackaged with a new title and cover less the two best songs boy from the country and today the original is fabulous but why do it again,0
bang bang kiss kiss this album is great to listen to if you want to hear the begining of glassjaw but this is just the tip of the ice berg demos go way back to impossible shot don fury and monster zero if you want to hear an even earlier inception of glassjaw be sure to check out sons of abraham album termites in his smile which is jewish hardcore kkbb was originally released before eyewtkas so it has a different sound but like every release glassjaw has put out each one sounds different from the previous everyone into glassjaw should get this album although the price listed on here is redic one should check out merchdirect,1
no idea about this album i ordered this album but it never came beware of third party sellers because they can be shifty i certainly wish i could give you a review of this album but unfortunately i never got it,0
prattgirl i normally do not go for mushy romance type books i am more of a fan of patterson other material but this book was great it was a quick read which once i started i could not put it down everytime i got my eyes dried and cheered up bam he hit me with something new and i was crying again patterson has outdone himself yet again,1
letters of the past i thoroughly enjoyed sam letters to jennifer i am an avid james patterson fan especially of the alex cross series and to read something different like this from mr patterson i was not sure i was going to enjoy as much however i have come to realize that to be a great author you need to show some diversity well mr patterson certainly shows that in this book its well written a quick read and very emotional i loved it the book is about sam the grandmother jennifer the grand daughter and brendan the lost love sam had left letters for jennifer to read that showed that sam life was not at all as picture perfect as people may have believe it to be it showed sam unhappiness with her husband and her new found love in another man upon coping with her own life in the big city and now coping with sam and then brendan we see how strong jennifer is and how much her love for her grandmother will get her through,1
great story patterson does it again sam letters to jennifer is one of those stories where you laugh you cry you make a fool of yourself jennifer is probably one of patterson most likable characters even though there were times when the book kind of reminded me of suzanne diary for nicholas very few i was pleasantly suprised it has a very happy and at the same time very heartbreaking ending their is a great mystery and it keeps you guessing until the very end all in all it is very vintage patterson fast paced and great story,1
yuck has james patterson sunk so low that he now penning drivel just for the money every NUMBER star reviewer of this book is right on so i will not repeat their critiques every NUMBER and NUMBER star reviewer must have read a different book i am angry that mr patterson holds his loyal fans in such low esteem that he allow so shallow and boring a book to come to market i am angry that his publisher was so greedy to do it like so many other bestselling authors patterson seems to have lost his touch even in his mystery series a smart author should know when to say when and if he does not then i do when if he continues to write this kind of garbage i will no longer read it,0
pathetic dialogue i do not understand why people adore patterson his lame dialogue is beyond tedious this one could have been written by a teenager,0
this is og mandino at his worst this is a fast read which continues to remind us that we should appreciate each day and those around us yes we should but i do not understand why mr patterson wants to venture out of the genre that he excels in mystery novels,0
absolute treacle it amazing that a book this bad could have been published it consists of one maudlin cliche after another the widowed jennifer who miscarried her dead husband child has to deal with her beloved grandmother having a stroke she meets someone who could be the one for her but oops he has a brain tumor and is likely to die the writing is amateurish full of telling instead of showing the only reason i finished it was because i was trapped on vacation in a cabin with nothing else to read,0
majorly sucked this book was jam packed with cliches and wooden characters and dialogue at NUMBER very small pages with a bigger font than necessary this novel was probably more like NUMBER real pages long it also seemed to be written for oh i do not know a ten year old maybe the writing seemed to be geared to a fourth grade level all i can hope for now is that it does not get made into a load of crap tv movie,0
just like suzanne diary i really liked suzanne diary for nicholas so i thought i check this out i did not think it was worth my time the books seemed exactly alike especially the tone of the character writing style suzanne vs sam it seemed clear that since suzanne diary did so well the author decided to write a book exactly like it it was an incredibly predictable love story,0
tear up the formula i am a fan of mr patterson books but this one was very disapointing it was like he sat down and wrote up a list of what will make women cry and then put every single thing in the book it is overdone to the point of you can not connect to the characters because the tragedy that happen to them are too much and in a manner that is not realistic to everyday life mr patterson needed to think instead of what will make a woman cry but what will make a good story not a formulated story this book tried to force the reader to be emotional and instead makes you feel annoyed at the characters and the story,0
some of the worst writing i have ever read this author needs to stick to his normal genre this was a good idea for a story line but i felt like a NUMBER year old wrote it i have read most of his other books and have enjoyed them but i had to force myself to finish this one,0
not the originals while the sound quality on these disks is excellent be aware that app NUMBER of the tunes are not the originals shout factory should be ashamed duping customers like this rhino records would never pull such a stunt go for the NUMBER disk rhino box set vol one instead you can find many high quality used versions for sale all over the web too,0
the only doo wop collection you will ever need this is a fantastic overall collection of doo wop groups songs i have heard this covers most of the variations of songs let alone the big hits of the day many years back,1
disappointing i was hoping the songs were the original recordings by the original artists little darlin is not the hit recording by the diamonds i do not know which group is singing but it the wrong one disappointing,0
complete waste of time i think this is the worst remake of any movie of all time what a piece of garbage can not come close to original,0
show the entire movie currently the movie start with barbara and her brother enroute to the graveyard however years ago the movie started with the introduction of the first the one zombie walking through the graveyard he was introduced as the murderer of a little girl and it showed his trial execution and then him rising from his coffin killing the burial detail before he heads in barbara direction i do not know why they edited this part out it gave the movie a little more substance,1
really bad sony transfer saw a friend copy of this and the difference between the dvd and this bluray is like night and day pun intended someone over at sony when transferring this disc made the entire movie so utterly dark it renders the disc nearly unwatchable granted the film is supposed to take place at night the new transfer is quite frankly awful,0
lol filth my absolute favorite horror movie of all time is night of the living dead the NUMBER black white low budget version i started watching the NUMBER version fi one afternoon and i did not stop watching it until it was over why it was hilarious plus they had a better zombie movie on afterwards and i did not have anything else to do until then this movie is despicable compared to the original from terrible dialogue to terrible themes this movie is just terrible if you have not seen the NUMBER version with all enthusiasm from myself please watch it a s a p but never subject yourself to the remake unless you are either punishing yourself or you need a good laugh,0
garbage never buy this it worked about NUMBER week i will never buy that again i can not find another similar pump yet,0
not for everyone if your main objective is the study of human relationships social rapports between humans and conquering and seducing otherpeople this movie is for you not an embarrassing movie at all for any of the actors just a nutty story and enfatuation of the author of the script withpeople relationships seduction etc this is not to say that the above aspects are unimportant not true just that perhaps a movie about such a theme might be more funfor some people than others,0
sweet and funny though completely predictable this movie is not going to shock you with it ending or offer you a new twist on the same old romcoms of the past it is a quintessential romcom but it so very worth your time it very funny i like all the actors in it and it just a fun light hearted movie,1
adorable fun movie great cast love this film it a classic ashley judd hugh jackman are fantastic greg kinnear is also great in this film love it love it,1
sweet little movie i know that this movie got mixed reviews whatever that means but i found it charming and sweet and rather touching at some parts i enjoyed the dvd for all the extras too i loved listening to hugh jackman with a different accent than his native australian and the oh so proper english accent he used in that other romantic movie he was recently in someone touches on so many emotions and ashley judd is funny and manic and her comic timing is great i am very happy that i bought this movie do not miss the cheerleader scene hugh jackman was gorgeous,1
hugh jackman is scrumptous i actually bought this movie having never seen it i saw greg kinnear on the box and read the blurb on the back and decided it was cheaper to buy it than to rent it i absolutely fell in love with hugh jackman ashley judd is always adorable in romantic comedies greg kinnear is never bad in his roles but he sometimes picks horrid roles the premise is cute and as romantic comedies go it was not horrible but it was rather predictable what made me give it NUMBER stars is the fact that hugh jackman was absolutely delightful as the bad boy casanova what took hollywood so long to find him,1
not the best the print is great but can not find more than half of the answers for my puzzles tried over and over and the book is one big failure,0
for light comic romantic entertainment it a winner michael j fox david ogden stiers woody harrelson and all the supporting cast members are wonderful in this small quiet story of a stranded doctor in a seemingly stagnant southern town it not a masterpiece not an award winner not an enduring example of its genre but it is fun and it is sweet and it offers a nice escape from the troubles of the day for decent folks it a very decent NUMBER minutes of movie magic,1
scanned from vhs this dvd has a very poor transcription of the original it either been poorly scanned from a very dirty print of the NUMBER mm film version or scanned from the vhs i suspect the latter as the colors are washed out and the film shows the not pirate this video tape warning after the film i might even be tempted to think this has not been produced by the studio as the dvd menu looks like it was made in idvd on a mac the only plus side is that the film is the full content including the scenes that are omitted from the tv broadcast version,0
duped i thought i was purchasing the special edition of pinocchio at least that was the picture of the dvd that was on the website what i got was a korean version i got my money back,0
pinocchio disney gold classic collection via amazon excellent service prompt delivery excellent conditionas described packaged well would use again,1
no extra features i would review the movie just the dvd first of all there are no making of storyboard production notes or any extra features the only extra feature you get with this dvd is the trailer oh did i mention that the dvd has beautiful picture on it rent it first then buy at disney outragous price that they want for this dvd just watch later on disney will reissue it and the others in their collection with all the extras this dvd lack if you want those extra features stick with the studios disney owns they are miramax dimension hollywood pictures touchstones pictures abc network anchor bay and walt disney pictures i hope this info helps others looking for disney movies other than the animated movies,0
very dissapointed i purchased this movie for my son NUMBER yrs and the add stated that the dvd was in excellant shape we played it once and noticed some sound problems but when went to play this again the sound was horrible i sent an email to amazon and received no response i would like to get a replacement but i do not know how to go about this as i no longer have any information on the person who actually sent it to me for the most part i have had good luck buying from amazon but this was a terrible purchase and we are very dissapointed,0
pinocchio not the only one who lies this version of pinocchio was in italian no where in the discription does this item indicate that it is the italian version now i have to send it back to italy for a refund,0
it a classic how can you not love the classic version of disney pinocchio the platinum edition has a bunch of extras and enhanced quality it felt like i was NUMBER years old again and watching it in the movie theater a must buy for any disney animation fan,1
this movie was such a bad movie i have always hated this movie not due to it violent and disturbing content but because of it bad acting and pure stupidity this movie is a children movie anyone who complains that it too scary and violent for kids is out of thier minds and are being way too uptight people like this are the reason why anime is so butchered when it comes to the states but that not what i am here to talk about i am here to talk about how bad this movie is it voice actors are not that good the wooden boy has equally wooden acting and the ending of the movie made no sense whatsoever come on disney explain to me why pinoccio suddenly drowns at the end of the movie when earlier on the was walking at the botton of the ocean talking to the fish without any indication that he needs air to live in the first place it was just plain stupid a move to make the viewers feel bad for the little hero when his death makes no sense,0
pinocchio NUMBER disc anniversary edition this movie is a classic and one that i enjoyed as a child growing up the xtras on this set make it even more endearing for young and old alike,1
love it bought this for my mother fast shipping the dvd was not in the original shrink wrap but the dvd was sealed no problems with the dvd itself it played well,1
bd live features mostly worthless i explored the bd live feature for the first time last night and most of the functions require registration on disney site on disney site an faq asserts that those features are being discontinued and account creation is no longer possible wth this disc was only released NUMBER months ago and the much heralded bd live features that personalize your disc and experience are already outdated for what it worth i just bought up released last week and the bd live features from disney appear to be nothing but downloading trailers for other films four of them my verdict on disney bd live total waste of time,1
not very good i actually ordered two dirtbags and within a week they were both leaking dirt so i went and ordered beed hacky sacks and now i am happy did not like the dirtbags at all,0
the fundamentals of math and philosophy for anyone looking for an introduction to math geometry more specifically or philosophy at large this is the book and in my estimation the edition to get heath is no fly by night pop philosopher his notes are almost as worthwhile as the text itself a truly monumental feat the rigors of geometry the method of logic learned in these proofs are one of the best ways to prepare the mind for real philosophy anyone can talk about the true and the good in a manner that inspires awe through vagueness and transcendent language but that is a very different matter than the sort of philosophy that is built upon the real work of logic and hard earned definitions if you have any interest in the latter i heartily commend this book to you,1
love it i love this toque i work in a milk refrigerator and wear it in there all the time supper thick and comfy,1
vote for stillson what a movie what a cast david cronenberg took king classic tale of precognition and predestination and gave it his own personal bleak touch christopher walken sleepy hollow is the perfect johnny smith taken out of normality and plunged into a psychic nightmare world his gift curse enables him to see both past and future events leading him ever closer to his final destiny martin sheen the little girl who lives down the lane is excellent as the lizard like senate candidate greg stillson horror mistress brooke adams invasion of the body snatchers shock waves sometimes they come back is johnny could should have been wife unable to shake johnny from her mind tom skerritt alien is the sheriff of castlerock who seeks out johnny in order to catch the infamous castlerock killer herbert lom asylum is johnny doctor even anthony zerbe the omega man and colleen dewhurst when a stranger calls are along for this wild ride highly recommended,1
good movie not much to say good story christopher walken is awesome great ending not too much gore four more words are required,1
very pertinent to how we raise our sons in this society very pertinent to how we raise our sons in our society a must read by ever parent while their son is growing up if you like this book try go west old man by max barnet a true tale about a father son trip across the country in a pickup truck discovering each other including their needs a clash of generations resolving,1
predictable the book may be good for people whom have little understanding of children in general of course boys have emotions and ofcourse they are trained not to express those it up to the parents to ensure that boys learn to express their emotions i wish the book had had practical examples of how to do it instead of stories of angry sad boys,0
the classic analysis on the internal life of boys i read most every book on this subject since i am a therapist and a parent this is a great place to start it might not be the most readable book but nonetheless is worth buying,1

great flick loved it in the NUMBER story and humor sill holds up kevin bacon young and energetic great fun spawned sequels which do not hold a candle to this original,1
funny and a little scary we watched this again after many years it is still just as funny kevin bacon is great i love reba in it too,1
good entetainment just a fun movie never made it big in the movies but an enjoyaable experience overall some swearing but it fits not just for the sake of using the f word which incidentally is never used,1
awesome picture now this is what high definition is all about i was very pleased with the picture quality on the tremors hd dvd the image makes you think you are watching a NUMBER movie release the picture is awesome,1
do not walk across the football pitch in the dark this movie is in my personal top NUMBER which just shows how much i enjoyed it it may not be art but by gum it cracking good fun the comedy is suitably black and nasty the tension is very palpable and the concept well the concept may not be absolutely original what is these days but it is very good i think very highly of it as an example of how good a horror movie should be ironic intelligent sassy smart and well acted the monsters are just this side of credible which makes it all the more riveting last night i was walking across three deserted football pitches on campus and suddenly remembered this movie and had to keep reminding myself that it was just a movie that is the sign of a successful beast horror movie it relies upon common sense a humourous screenplay actors who do not ham any more than is necessary and a general atmosphere of cracking good fun brilliant stuff,1
quite possible the worst movie of all times NUMBER stars this movie stinks the story is nothing like the original the acting is horrific the swordfighting utterly ridiculous the scene that sums it all up is when the guards will not chase after a carriage going about NUMBER mph and everyone escapes i have no idea how on earth anyone could make a movie so terrible extremely torturous to watch do not buy it do not rent it in fact just read the book which is awesome,0
laurel hardy perils the further perils of laurel and hardyi received this item this week march NUMBER NUMBER it was one i did not know was avalable saw thru a link i have the other items in this youngson series from other publishers late last year this one is poor to say the least with faded washed out images although the sound is ok the grain is very high and contrary to another review pal tv in australia in the NUMBER s NUMBER s did not look anything as bad as the images in this dvd the other youngsons that came out last year were better although the highest priced one did leave a lot to be desired in picture quality also but not like the further perils if only warner bros would buy more of these things for extras on their great dvd releases then we would have restoration similar to what they have provided on at least one l h dvd set but to have this title in the collection gets us to more completion of the youngson compilations on dvd,0
received a used set nothing fundamentally wrong with it but the manufacturer original box had been opened before and rather clumsily taped back together and the aluminum case is covered in small scratches and dents i do not have the time to return the set for replacement since it was bought as a gift for an upcoming occasion disappointing,0
a disappointment having made the change to veganism recently and discovering seitan i was expecting this cookbook to open the door to non meat paradise the description of the book and the reviews of others made it sound like the holy grail bah i say NUMBER of the recipes using the prepared seitan call for the wheat meat to be battered and deep fried so where is the healthy cooking in that i was looking for recipes for the actual seitan preparation using different seasonings and flavors and then hoping to find a fake meatloaf recipe or a fake turkey and stuffing for thanksgiving i am still looking,0
seitan quickly cookbook on cooking with seitan was in excellent condition and arrived very promptly the book itself was not all i had hoped too many weird ingredients that i can not begin to find but that is not the fault of amazon or the bookseller who sent the order,1
damaged goods while my sister was extremely excited about the glasses i got her has a gift one arrived broken when i called customer service to replace the broken glass i was notified that amazon would not replace the damaged item i could get a full refund but they would not send a replacement i was appalled what business refuses to replace damaged items you can guarantee i will not be buying anything being shipped through amazon anymore i will buy directly from the seller,0
screens wore out quickly the screens on this product wore out very quickly and are NUMBER to replace which is almost the cost of the entire product at NUMBER everything else seems fine,0
very disappointed this is a set book for the university course i am following to be honest i have not read it all i have read the introductory chapter and picked at the rest of the book i am disappointed that other reviewers suggest that this book is well written and academic it a rambling incoherent mess of ideas that proposes large scale state censorship control and as such has no place in universities which should protect the ideals of academic freedom and free speech the net is not considered as a political forum rather there is a heavy authoritarianism i am very disappointed with it,0
not her best i love virginia henley but these characters are so disconnected and unromantic there is simply nothing endearing about any of the players in this book in fact most of all the characters are so flawed and dark i hate to consider it a romance definately put this on your if there is nothing else to read list,0
insipid this book and others like it so insult the intelligence of anyone with half a brain read something substantial for a change,0
a cd you can listen to over and over i never heard of james tipper until i heard about this cd on a newsgroup i rarely buy cd based on one song but i did this time and was very suprised it has lots of different styles and moods so you do not get tired of one vibe like you do with alot of cd there something for everyone i like the techno sounding stuff like bioluminescence and evolve and the title track and my wife likes the ballads that are done mostly with piano lyrics are great and there are clever production touches overall money well spent,1
neighbor dog liked it more than i thought i got this product to keep my neighbor pesky dog out of my goddamned garden i coated some of my seeds with this stuff before i planted a recent carrot patch as expected the dog came and ate all of the carrots i expected him to get sick or at least no longer enjoy the carrots due to their uranium nature but he loved it he continued to eat the carrots visibly growing as he ate them he left my garden at least NUMBER inches taller and with a spryness i have never seen out of the damn old mutt i watched this scene from my window with horror and i still am not sure what to do about this at night i can see a faint green glow coming from the neighbor doghouse which i assume is a result of my carrot shenanigans i only gave this product NUMBER starts because it grew overnight the largest carrots i have ever seen they were NUMBER long and a vibrant orange that i have never seen before,0

i like it i love it i want some more of it yeah give it to me baby give me some more what a tasty little movie now let me be serious this movie is delicious gibson and hunt are both terrific have you seen braveheart well that movie is only good because of mel gibson what women want is good and funny for the same reason maybe helen hunt had a little to do with that but gibson alone is sufficient for a movie goodness and funniness basically gibson and hunt made this movie work the screenwriter and director and everyone other than gibson and hunt had nothing to do with it,1
distaff rather pretentious comedy featuring mel gibson who despite all the emasculation is in bumpy toothy silly little boy mode what women want indeed he a don juan in the advertising world who gets zapped by his blow dryer while drinking some interesting looking cabernet the result he given the ability to read women thoughts this is distressing at first regressive too according to the writers all women these turn of the millennium i am every woman women primarily want to feast their eyes on mel tooshy hear me roar well our hero soon learns to use his newfound superpowers for his own profit but then ah but then the movie suddenly gets very serious most of the second act is dull the movie finally wears out its welcome starting with about the last NUMBER minutes rent only if you want to annoy your boyfriend which is really what women want kidding kidding sheesh,0

good overall toy this is a very fun boat overall it is not very fast but it has great range and it batteries last a long time the only problem with the battery system is that it takes NUMBER aa batteries and u keep having to get new ones i also recommend bringing it to a place with no waves so the boat does not tip overall this is a very good boat for its price and especially good for younger children,1
there are none so blind then those who refuse to see yes mrs pulling has done her best to caution others about breaking with reality and her book serves as an adequate example of what can happen when someone does become reality impared it contains no real facts to support her claims that dungeons and drangons had any thing to do with any deaths what so ever and what facts she does offer are either falsely described or out right lies i agree that if you are a bad parent you should probably error on the side of caution and limit the activities of your little monster but i think not keeping guns in the house and not letting your child butcher pets both things mrs pulling admits she or her son did should come well before stopping them from playing d d besides if you get rid of d d who will you blame when they finally do kill someone,0
wow we had heard about this item and the many similar items and decideded that we give it a try wow we had no idea how fantastic it would be or would continue to be and continue to be the design is great the controls work it a fantastic piece of equipment the only complaint is that it not silent but we do not think that would matter under the circumstances we were not either,1
elvis review if you bought this you proably already like elvis music this cd is worth the money many of my favorite elvis songs were in his movies and never released as singles or for that matter hits this is a great way for me to hear them again,1
excellent edition of the book this is an excellent edition of the book it even includes a small timeline biography of alexandre dumas which was very insightful overall no complaints with this product at all,1
the count of monte cristo by alexandre dumas kindle all i can say is amazing this novel is incredible the subtle and deliciously wicked scenarios that edmund dantes orchestrates to exact his revenge on his enemies are awe inspiring and soooo entertaining although the NUMBER jim caviezel movie is a great stand alone film it reveals so little of the subplots and supporting characters that you can dive into the book as if it a brand new story and it really does not ruin either one please keep in mind that it is a NUMBER th century novel so you will have to wade through some serious romantic protestations but they do not take away from the action definately worth reading and free on kindle thank you kindle,1
this is the muhammad ali of books the greatest of all time dumas is the greatest story teller ever and this is his finest work if you love adventure great yarns or being captivated by excellence read this book,1
worth a second read i read and enjoyed this book as a youth later i read some of the three musketeers was bored and thought maybe dumas had been a taste of adolescence but the second time around i found this story still a great read monte cristo is not a study in psychology or culture it is an amusement park ride before disney an indiana jones film in ink a heck of a way to spend a rainy afternoon and make sure your plans for the evening are flexible the version i bought bantom was too skinny however thus the missing star also for typos life is too short to read half of a masterpiece subvert the culture of instant gratification and buy the unabridged version same goes for hugo les miserables a similar bit of NUMBER th century french romanticism even more rambling and magnificent in its un cut version,1
kinda wish i had read the longer one this is by far the best book i have ever read i hate reading and i read this NUMBER page book in three days it was for summer reading for school and i thought that i would read it before i saw the movie coming out soon i am so glad i did thanks,1
poor quality let me be clear that i am a big fan of the count of monte cristo but do not spend your money on this copy visually it unappealing to the eyes looks like a phone book what is far worse though is that the editing in this book is horrendous i will be half way through a sentence and the other half of it is starting a completely knew paragraph there are spelling errors throughout the text and what is really annoying is that the table of contents page numbers do not match up with the text page numbers there about a NUMBER page difference between the two how that happened i do not know but let me tell you that there are better unabridged copies of this excellent book out there,0
the count of monte cristo i first read this wonderful novel in high school interestingly i read this book by personal selection and not by a literature assignment i remember it as the first book i loved i am a voracious reader of reviews on amazon and other sources a recent review of this book reminded me that i should read it again i am enjoying it as much now as i did then,1
the count of monte cristo although count of monte cristo kept me on my toes wondering what would happen next it seemed to drone on by without a certain explanation i loved the book it just had parts that i thought dumas could have easily done without besides that count of monte cristo was a wonderfully written book that deserves full credit on itself it had such passion and devotion inside it it as though dumas himself was feeling the same imprisonment as dantes,1
the count of monte cristo oxford world classics thoroughly entertaining and timeless read makes one reflect strongly on the emotions and ups and down of life i wish i had realized the cross references were present at the end of the book as it may have clarified a few things all in all i found it to be a book that i did not want to put down i read reviews that recommended the unabridged versions and i am glad that i read it,1
superb but definitely a product of its time judging by the reviews here criticizing this book is like criticizing shakespeare anything less than full throated praise is dismissed let me be clear i loved this book and it was well worth the time it took to read it is deservedly considered a timeless classic nevertheless it definitely has a pace that is not seen in modern books if this had been created by a contemporary writer it would probably be about NUMBER shorter i am not saying that would make it better it would simply make it a book created for modern sensibilities if you like fast paced modern writing you will definitely need to recalibrate your expectations once you accept this book on its own terms it is a very rewarding read,1
terrible terrible edition a wonderful classic story butchered by a senseless editor who removed major portions of the story without letting the reader know the description on the back cover misleads the consumer into thinking that one is getting so much more than the full text the edition includes a brief introduction of the author critical analysis and explanatory notes i rather do without the side commentary and get the full original manuscript the problem is not that the editor decided to abridge the book but that they chose to conceal this fact from the reader the removed portions are integral to the storyline and i was left baffled by how disjointed the novel seemed so uncharacteristic of alexandre dumas then i found out it not the author fault book is highly recommended but i would also recommend that readers invest in more trustworthy versions out there,0
excellent old world type thriller definitely better than the movie talk about revenge being best served cold this is the epitomy of that,1
abridged version buyer beware this is the abridged version of the dumas classic having not read the original yet i can only compare itto the three musketeers dumas writing style losesenergy in the abridging process the reader ought tobe aware that the story has been simplified and summarized if you want the true flavor of dumas order the unabridgedversion,0
horrible do not waste your time reading this edition there are many grammatical errors in this edition terrible formatting will not let you get pleasure from reading this book,0
great story of redemption sweet revenge at it finest love romance long friendship gone wrong it all in here not like the movie so do not beterribly disappointed,1

this book would make a great mother day gift this book was given to me i read it and placed it on my book shelf as a writer i have used the quotes in articles and letters a perfect addition to your library if you write to or about children,1
highly recommended baby doll this laughing calin doll is perfect for young toddlers she is small and light enough to be carried around easily her expression is very pleasant she is the perfect play mommy doll she appears very well made and durable,1
this is one of the best movies from the late NUMBER s it been close to twenty years since i watched this film at first it looks like an NUMBER attempt at a date movie but this one goes much further than that it has a captivating plot likable characters and one of the greatest soundtracks of all time even though i am not a fan of musicals or dancing i still found myself enjoying this story if you are a fan of saturday night fever you will most likely appreciate dirty dancing as well,1
it was the best it was the best movie i have ever seen it was romantic as well as exciting nothing could ever top it patrick swayze is the best actor in the world and jennifer grey was pretty good too,1
ordered for christmas but ordered for delivery for christmas but after order was told it would not be delivered by christmas it was confirmed at purchase time to be delivered before christmas now i have to go back out and find it in a store and then try and return this one to amazon not much fun,0
one of the best movies ever made this movie is the best one i have ever seen i have the soundtrack and it great too the story dancing and music is unbelievable i think everyone should see this at least once in their life,1
i love this movie i always thought this was a lame movie but i really love it now that i have seen it yes it is a chick flick so if you do not like those types of movies do not buy it,1
i love this movie jennifer gray and patrick swayze are the terrific duo in this dancing romance on the road i love the song baby when she is teaching him the cha cha i definatly recommend this movie to everybody a time less classic,1
sexy thoughtful this album especialy the tittle cut remedy makes me think that he really knows how woman want to be treated keep up the good work we really need brothas out there that still think like you,1
NUMBER usher this cd is hot i love it one of my favorite usher cds ever has several hits one of his best ever must have for the fan of usher i am happy to have it for my own collection its great from start to finish,1
love this album usher NUMBER is one of the best r b albums i have ever purchased every song on this album is beautiful i always like usher but with this album die hard fan he does a great job balancing the up tempo songs and the ballads the fast tracks make you want to get up and dance and the slow ones make you want to cry and just call that special someone in your life and just tell them i love you his voice is excellent on every track and most importantly the man lets you know what love is about the jewels on this album are u remind me u got it bad twork it out can u help me if i want to good ol ghetto and ttp lol basically every track on the album on a last note those of you who know what good r b music is this album is a must trust me,1
who would have thought that this cute little guy by the name of usher who came out with the awesome my way would grow up to be an arrogant womanizer with about as much originality as britney spears grow up usher be a man you either have the talent personality and originality or you do not leave r b and go be one of brit back up dancers,0
NUMBER nd best cd i have ever heard second to nsync celebrity this cd is my favorite of all time when you want to listen to NUMBER of NUMBER songs on a cd you know it good this cd has an amazing balance of ballads and fast trax and rap and the ballads are incredible u got it bad is one of the best songs i have ever heard in my life i would definitely recommend that anyone a fan of pop r b or rap to get this cd you will love it,1
usher was creative then now this is the usher i liked who actually released good music instead of that stale let it burn and yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah he was on fiyah in summer NUMBER till NUMBER with his blazing hot videos and being himself with a little bit of michael jackson influence instead of trying to be his minime like he does all the time today and not even be close to dancing as great,1
do not bother a horrible movie which makes dull ordinary with the exception of sex one of the most complex writers individuals that ireland has produced if cinematography alone is your sole requisite in a film by all means buy the dvd one good aspect of the movie ewan susan lynch rendition of lass of aughrim but you can download that,0
ewan mcgregor hot although ewan mcgregor is my ultimate favorite actor in the entire world i have to say that this was a terrible movie and yes sadly ewan co produced it i do not why he would ever sign to be co producer of that film it should have been moulin rouge so back to the movie i hated susan lynch in this film has she ever heard of shaving i know this is back in the day so i will give her that much but she was a little too hairy for me this movie is really graphic and it shows a lot of uh stuff ewan was so cute in it but i think there could have been a better nora picked this is definitlely an erotic film like the actual overview says the reason why i gave this film only NUMBER star is because it was so hard to follow i figured out in the middle that time was jumping very fast they should have dates as subtitles it jumped ahead quickly it was too graphic and overall it probably one of the worst films i have ever seen sorry ewan,0
riveting reading fast paced i could hardly put it down it left me wanting more i will recommend this book to family and friends,1
good for a b day prsent my brother loves these game hes favorite is the one for computer but we lost the disk when i was in kindergarten when this comes out tell me how great it is,0
terrible terrible people how fun is it to watch a racist lewd borrish and dumb person beating up people for no f g reason as little as possible all the film does is show two unorthadox sleep in car all night hold up bars just because there are black people there and reapeatedly getting the same food as NUMBER minutes ago and a point that should go out there is no car chase just someone chasing a train i will end by saying that this trashy film deserved no oscars bye,0
fast moving police drama this is a story about a new york city police detective gene hackman and his partner roy scheider and their relentless pursuit to discover a drug source the high speed chase scenes take them far outside the city limits and get deadly when an attempt is made to kill gene hackman character popeye doyle this is good police drama and quite entertaining,1
timeless greyish and well structured police story there is a scene at the beginning of this classic movie wherein everyone seems to be having a great time in a bar when from nowhere a sort of stop time moment occurs when dectective popeye eyeing some locals knows for dead center certainty something major is wrong from there it is only a matter of piecing together like the ubiquous and sinsiter car the plot this gritty seemingly greyish and astonishingly well edited movie offers a powerful glimpse into the mechanisms and travails of international corruption,1
the best crime movie ever made french connection is a exciting action crime film starring gene hackman as popeye dole a n y narcotics cop who is investigating the recent flow of herion coming into n y he and his partner roy shrieder get into the absorbing process of phone tapping following suspects and stakeouts a real good crime movie from director william friedkin one of the best films ever made also has the most exciting chase scene in history a winner,1
the french connection definitely keeps your interest it contains so many different facets that one wants to view it several times over just so that you have not missed anything,1
inadequate disclosure received the book in a timely fashion but the cd rom and the timeline were not included this should have been clearly stated in the listing the timeline was to be a NUMBER th birthday present for my twin sister,0
low quality sound the volume is low and even with my tv turned all the way up i can barely hear it,0
the real playas two playas playing hard to get with each other morris chestnut and vivica a fox play games with each other this is just a movie about the person who has the best game i enjoyed it and i liked it a lot if you like comedy and if you are a fan of any of the characters in the movie then you would definitely like this movie,1
great resource i have been in a disciple bible study class for NUMBER years and have seen others with this book finally decided to order it for myself it a great resource and has good information that is factual and concise i highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the bible,1
awesome awesome guide the best as finally been put out for a reference price guide on the best ever movie star marilyn monroe even she would be amazed i bet terrific job thanks for all the hard effort in making it all worth it,1
crystal growing science kit this was a gift to my grandson and he was mesmerized and could not wait to start growing the crystals i told him i did something like that when i was a child grew rock formations in a fish bowl,1
i never thought meryl streep could give a bad performance i never thought that maryl streep could give a bad performance it is difficult to believe this is the same actress from sopjie choice and the french lt woman oh well i guess one stinker in an otherwise glorious career is to be forgiven do not watch unless you are a movie masochist,0
okay this movie was okay it was not a NUMBER more like a NUMBER i could have gone without buying this foolishness,0
too drawn out i usually enjoy reading this author however that was not the case in this particular title the plot was too drawn out,0
hilarious this movie was even funnier than the first i love how they brought back characters from the first movie and continued storylines definitely recommended but you need to make sure you see the first movie before this one i stop after this one though tremors NUMBER was pretty bad,1
not quite tremors NUMBER does not live up to what i had hoped for the movie has its funny moments but just does not hook the viewer like the original a key ingredient missing in this movie is kevin bacon if you have not seen the first tremors i would strongly recommend not viewing the sequel however if you enjoyed the first one the sequel may be worth your time,0
worthless they peeled off within a week i cleaned the tub wiped it down with alcohol and even put a heater in it for a couple hours to warm up the surface i did everything i could to insure they would adhere well but to no avail,0
i really do not recommend this product purchased this a while back and was disappointed from the moment i opened the box the construction was flimsy and the mic did not even work all this thing did was waste time and money,0
drying and sticky i did not care for this product at all i found that it dried out my hair and was also very sticky i will not purchase again,0
this book is possibly the best i have ever read this book is extraodinary i started reading it expecting it to be boreing after the first eight pages i was reading it every free second i got i can guarantee that anyone will love this book,1
a story as lush as the planet it is set on come on this book is over rated it is an amusing story but unengaging the characters are cold and it is difficult to empathise with them i did read the next two books to see how the story was resolved but it was not it turned into the x files i e continuous suspense convolutions but no resolution a story must have a beginning middle and and um an end the recent appearance of the dune extension books house atreides and confirm that the story continues be it chronologically before or after the original dune should have been a trilogy at most,0
a great book horrible price i had this book i have read it twice when i moved i left it so that the next person would be able to read it and enjoy it knowing that i would probably get a digital version the next time i wanted to read it NUMBER NUMBER for a NUMBER year old book that can be picked up in innumerable used book stores that much for a book that is NUMBER years old there no reason for it to be more expensive than a print version now instead of buying it i am going to pass i am also going to pass on all the sequels i might have bought after it and all because penguin does not understand the digital world yet readers should not have to pay for a publisher mistake set a reasonable price for this book and i happily purchase it,0
predictable after NUMBER pages everybody could guess the end i just hate predictable book the first part of this book is worth reading but if your not an hard core sci fi fan drop it after,0
it s just not very good i read the dune novels as a teenager and recently started re reading them NUMBER years later dune messiah is exactly as i remembered it a disappointment not just in comparison to dune but a true mediocrity in its own right with a surprising amount of fragements of thoughts and ruminations that just do not make any sense the point of dune messiah and children of dune is to enjoy the much grand god emperor of dune,0
you will not regret simply the best novek i have read this not just a sci fi novel the world created by herbert can only suit a envoirement in future the story starts somehow complicated but soon you will discover the intelligence of the author if you have not read it yet this must be first thing you have to read,1
brief but to the point this book is very brief but i guess this is how its supposed to be since it seems frank herbert wanted it to be a link between dune before paul and the dune after paul the end of the book is the perfect way to take us to the next stage the children of muadib,1
the greatest novel ever written words can not describe the depth of this book greatness not only is dune the greatest single sci fi novel ever written it is the greatest novel ever written it introduces the reader to a new and fantastic world more realistic than any other in literature frank herbert was a genius paul is a little stiff but at the same time he is more real than most people i know this is the first novel that i have read that wore me out reading it that is how powerful it is there are scenes that simply left me physically exhausted after reading them no book i have ever read before or since has drawn me in like dune does enough good things can not be said about dune it is pitiful that the modern library skipped this in it listing dune blows ulysses gatsby and anything by faulkner completely out of the water whether you are a sci fi fan or not you must read dune you will not regret it,1
the best book i ever read dune is the best book i ever read i know it is not a good argument to persuade you but it is the only thing i can say read it,1
great writing poor publishing ace reprint of isbn NUMBER NUMBER never before have i seen a book contain so many print editorial errors ink application is not homogeneous resulting in many blots light print areas print pressure is inconstant resulting in wavy print apparent font reduction then there are the editorial errorspg NUMBER the gift is the blessing of the river giver the most egregious so farif there had been physical defect allowing return to place of purchase this paperback would surely have been exchanged for a previously published edition of better quality,0
do yourself a favor and do not open it i rather liked dune but this poor excuse for a sequel is just plain awful when i closed the book i could not even remember what it was all about so unless you are a great fan of frank herbert or intend to read the entire series do not bother,0
sorry but i really did not like it very much i guess it just personal taste but i am sorry to say that i did not really like dune that much i really wanted to i know it has a great reputation and legions of fans who have read it multiple times i just finished reading it last night the overall setting and the complex story were fine the opening scene the visit from the reverend mother was intriguing but somehow the writing style for the rest of the book just did not click with me you know how some books have wonderfully crafted language and sentence structure that mezmerizes you well this book was not like that time and again i found some passages awkwardly worded as well while there was a great assortment of characters i felt no emotional attachment to any of them i had previously read a couple of herbert sci fi novels and liked them but this one well does not get NUMBER stars from me your mileage may vary i will not be reading any of the remaining books,0
read the series i only read dune after i had seen the movie NUMBER hour version and was overwhelmed i then proceded to read the rest of the series NUMBER books and tape all three the two three and four hour versions of the movie the book dune is one you must read thru at least twice including the glossary and index before all the ramifications of the start to become clear the butlerian jihad for example and the realizations will change your first impressions and so you will read it again i would love to read a of this series but alas for naught for a great time on a rainy saturday get all six sit down and read them in order you will not be disapointed,1
dune best science fiction book i have ever read of course that is just what every other review thinks but hell it the truth i picked this book up from my girlfriends brother for a school report yeah i do not read muchy for my enjoyment but anyway i read it and now i want more this book has got me reading for the hell of it and i am purchasing dune messaih and children of dune and can not wait to read them dune changed my outlook on reading with it indept look at politics treachery and the way these two twist together in the dune i love it,1
a lifetime favorite i love the original dune books and have also enjoyed the new ones i own the entire series and can not think of a better recommendation to give,1
kindle version i have climbed out of bed to write this for you because i can take it no longer whoever made the kindle version should be fired the book itself is great however random missing spaces extra spaces italics that begin or end when they should not mis spellings of stillsuit as stulsuit please buy another version this is an embarrassment to e publishing and you think with it being on the computer it be easier to check for errors guess not look elsewhere for your ebook copy of dune,0
embarrassing ebook after reading the kindle sample of this book i have to agree with the many critical reviews of this edition this is not a review of the writing which is excellent but of this electronic edition of the title aside from the fact that NUMBER for the electronic edition of a book that is over NUMBER years old and has already been widely published as a mass market paperback for for half the price is obscene the quality of this kindle edition is so horrible i would not want it if it was free dune is one of the great classics of scifi literature but this ebook is an embarrassment to both the publisher and the author and i would urge anyone interested in reading this book to pass on this edition instead find any one of the cheap tens of thousands of used copies that are easily available of this title,0
dune is the book for our time i was only NUMBER years old when i first saw the screen version of this book and then i was hooked granted i should not have gotten interested in the book just because of the movie but the movie went well with the book it put a face to the all the characters that i was so fascinated with dune should be a book that should be read in high school and studied there is a message for those who read the book and those who are die hard fans of frank herbert will understand and relate it to present day,1
what was the point of this book again this book was a complete let down from the first one the ending was well done but other than that i can not find anything at all good about this book the first half of the book is completely pointless unlike the first book we do not need to know about the characters because they are basically the same the only reason i finished this book was to read the next book,0
no doubt about it one look at all these reviews will leave you with no doubt that this is one of the best science fiction stories ever told but wait the best is yet to come there are five other books in the series my advice however is to skip dune messiah and go right to children of dune the second book is not nearly as good as the first the third is even better herbert writing improved with age and god emperor of dune heretics of dune and chapterhouse dune will blow you away even if you just sort of like the original dune,1
dune this is my favorite novel of all time i have read and re read it since i was a teenager frank herbert was an absolute genius science fiction is not usually my favorite genre of reading but this is the exception i have the entire collection of dune books including the rare dune encyclopedia a must read,1
interesting continuation like dune it is flawed spending too much time on internal monologue and exposition better left to the reader also like dune it is brilliant in many ways symbolism philosophy intrigue etc i think one of the reasons that people did not like it as much as dune was because they were expecting more of the same and got instead a very changed universe with several contradictions sequels in far future sci fi always lack the wonder of discovering a new world but in a way watching the development is just as fascinating if you liked dune read dune messiah,1
just a few steps to total enlightenment NUMBER read the book during the summer time NUMBER download the song final dream from the NUMBER s movie dune NUMBER immerse yourself in water and or listen to the song NUMBER break out in tears this book will change your life forever,1
dune dune is one of the most inspirational sci fi books that i hav ever read the technology in the book seemed to be extremely none feasible to the recent human culture thst sorrounds us as a people the story of the chosen one paul a man that was given to the fremen as there saviour he was the chosen one the only male that could stand to the poisonious juice that only the benajesuits have the power as women to resist the power of the jui ce in order to become one of there own as the story went on thw character of feel in tot he world of the fremen and wanted to help them out of there fight for freedom he was the only one that could do it for them if he did not do it he would just be wasting his talent his talent to control the world in his fingers he do it all he had the people afraid of what he could do and it was all over one little insignifacant thing he now controls the spice and will for a long time never be harmed,1
just the best honestly this book is one of the best i have ever read i have read a lot of books its plot characterization and flawless storytelling make for one compelling read,1
not the best book ever but it is up there this book made me order the rest of the series and even tempted me to buy the ones written by his son despite the horrible reviews they have been given on here you will lose yourself in the world mr herbert spins the NUMBER movies made from this book do not do it justice,1
an over rated piece of fiction i had several close friends recommend dune to me all proclaiming how amazing it was as a novel only to hear later that not one of them finished it for the same reason it was kinda boring if you are asking yourself why someone would praise and recommend a book that they find to be boring then you are just as mystified as i am i have yet to meet anyone who has read dune who liked it or ever finished it the books major problem is it has too many minor characters and very poor character development the lead character paul is a good example as he has no personality or any interesting qualities whatsoever sadly all the characters are this way i did finish this book after forcing myself to keep reading for six months and i will say that it eventually does get more interesting but only in the last two chapters,0
warm and self sacrificing jane and tom meet fall in love and there are many obstacles to overcome different ending bittersweet loved it will not tell all as it will ruin the movie,1
horribly disappointing first i will be upfront i did not get very far in this movie there are few movies that i will stop in the middle in fact i can not think of any but this was one of them i was very disappointed with this movie it makes fun of jane austen it criticizes everything about jane austen time period everything in the movie seemed designed to mock from the pond filled with scum in front of a great house to an unpolished mirror that could hardly be looked in to show the sisters reflections it blatantly attacks christianity or being faithful to your spouse before you ever even meet them by keeping your wedding vows as strange as it sounds i felt like i was being attacked through the movie screen it is a movie full of lies particularly the lie that by being faithful to your spouse you are missing out the opposite is true hopefully the movie improved by the end but i could not make it that far to find out,0
curl up and enjoy on a rainy day with a cup of tea if you remotely enjoy jane austin works this story is sure to please anne hathaway is stunning and believable as jane austin james mcavoy portrays young jane love interest and their chemistry is fantastic romantic witty sad funny passionate all things that make a great chick flick you will wish it would not end one word to the wise do not subject your husbands boyfriends to this movie or you will never hear the end of it,1
great movie anne hathaway did a great job as jane austin and this movie stayed very true to her real life what we know of it anyway,1
contrived and so far from what we know about jane austen it is impossible to make the leap this is no mrs brown it is a fictitious assumption about jane austen and her paramours made into a romantic tale that hardly holds up with plot contrivances galore and the inevitable heartbreak watch it once then forget that you did it is harmless,0
one word unbelievable this is truly the most compelling book on commercial office space that i have read and i have read all of them it is short concsice and to the point tunis captures the essence of what it means to negotiate for a piece of space and delivers it in a way that the layman can understand even the more complex points a one of a kind book that i would heartily recommend for anybody looking to get in the commercial real estate field or just searching for office space,1
greaat movie this is a great movie its NUMBER alan parish has troubles with his father he finds a game named jumanji at a construction site he plays with his former friend sarah whiddle they play and until the game reads NUMBER or NUMBER in the jungle he must wait the game is not played until NUMBER years later by a young girl and boy that will be living in the parish home peter the young boy rolls a NUMBER or NUMBER and he is unleashed this wild movie is all in one day it turns out they can not play until sarah whiddle joins they find her and the whole town including her try to believe it was the father that killed him i hate to say it but the ending is sad once they finish the game it should all dissappear robin williams is not the only one relased from the game who else go buy it now,1
my son favorite i did not see this movie in the theatre but we rented it last year on video and really enjoyed it surprisingly however my NUMBER year old son was wild about it i had heard it was too scary for young kids but he loved it in fact it has become one of his all time favorite movies and we have rented it so many times at his request that we are going to buy the video for him for christmas the special effects in this movie are great and unlike the professional reviewers i think the character development is fine i think reviewers forget that sometimes people watch movies just for entertainment and fun,1
jumanji is fun what a great movie and a clever concept a board game that sucks you into it and must be finished by the originals who played the game i remember seeing jumanji in the movie theatre when it first came out and this past weekend had the opportunity to rewatch it thank you resale dvds starring robin williams and bonnie hunt the action is fast paced and easy to follow no swearing in this movie makes it appropriate for all ages though little ones might be frightened by the rampaging animals there is nothing disneylike in their qualities still the story of sticking together and teamwork prevail throughout the entire film bebe neuwirth and david alan greier are great in their supporting roles bonnie hunt gets some of the best lines in the film with regards to cheating and a downtown sale an early kirstin dunst is also great if you have never seen jumanji i encourage you check it out it fun and you always wonder what the game is going to come up with next,1
day timer stand i was tired of having to pick up my day timer every time i wanted to view it with this stand i can leave it at the corner of my desk and view it at an easy angle to see without ever having to pick it up it is sturdy enough to write on and has storage space below for stationary letterhead my only complaint is the high price i would have bought a different brand if i could have found the same thing cheaper,1
so where the rest of it i was intrigued by the now cancelled tv show and so decided to pick up the book that the show was based on so i could have some closure on the story unfortunately the book is nothing more than a lead in to the show the books ends about where the show picks up needless to say i am still in the dark about where the story goes and how it ends very frustrating it was a decent book up to the abrupt and unsatisfying ending,0
a sorry bit of commercialism i should have known better after the rose red trash this is a cheap ploy to sucker you in to watching the series not only that i have noticed stephen king current writing is concerned more with his pet peeves political leanings and predjudices than with telling a good story maybe it is time for king to retire,0
great toy great service i ordered this for my daughter because she lost her other beanie baby it is a very durable toy the order came quickly in the mail and in very good shape,1
fuel pump though i am sure that this pump would have operated properly i was extremely disappointed that the carter pump that was sent to me looked nothing like the pump in the picture instead it was the newer style bolt together type and when you are trying to restore an old mustang and the pump is suppose to appear a certain way like in the advertised picture that what you expect to receive it all about the details doug s,0
plays but is noisy this is noisy cd player it makes a whiring sound when cd are played terrible fast forward and backwards goes to slow awkward to use worst cd player i have ever owned do not buy it you will be sorry,0
this book is being revised so the facts can be adjusted i started reading it but could not continue when i found out that the facts were being altered by kerry and brinkley in the meantime read unfit for command it gives several excerpts from this book anyway then maybe when the new version of the non fiction comes out i will read it although i thought non fiction was truth and truth could not be changed i guess it depends on whose truth it is i gave it one star because it pretty thick and i think it probably took a lot of imagination to come up with that much,0
kerry tour of duty for north vietnam the book has no information on kerry tour of duty with hanoi jane and her gang nothing on how north vietnam leader dredit kerry fonda for saving north vietnam from defeat nothing on how kerry family financial benefitted from the normalization of relations with his old comrades in the new vietnam,0
not a hero offshore for so long in his first tour then back for only four months received minor wounds got medals and out while others slogged through jungle in the real war kerry is no hero a biased book the purpose of which is to win an election not to give a true account of the war kerry came back and accused our soldiers of hideous acts of cruelty and murder he testitied to these facts while our men were still there some of them were even being held prisoners by the enemy at the time how do you think they were treated by the enemy after hearing what our soldiers did to their people a disgusting excuse for an objective book save your money,0
campaign for kerry to call this book an unbiased look at kerry life is extremely naive from the very beginning it reads like a cheesy campaign commercial if you like kerry and his politics you will like the book conversely if you do not you will not,0
waste of time and money this book is a waste of valuable paper kerry is a freaking traitor and only received commendations because he had friends in high places to anyone who supports him and his too obvious lies you are dumber than i thought americans ever would be kerry did not do any more than any of our boys are doing out there every day and less than most i hated the book and have no respect for the man behind it,0

liberals read this book a masterpiece reviewer a reader from new york united statesto say that this is an informative easy read is to grossly understate thefacts i have been a lifelong democrat ok a liberal democrat i alwaysjust assume that all of these guys are just rush limbaugh clones allsinging from his hymnal a friend of mine convinced me to read this book andi must admit i have started to re think some of my views this guy stateshis opinion gives you the facts to back it up it hard to dispute whathe says i am still a democrat notice i left the d lower case but nolonger consider myself a liberal i can not believe it myself read thisbook,1
what a world a friend of mine recommended this cd to me and i have to admit it was way beyond anything i ever imagined i have practically worn the cd out listening to it and hanging on every surreal nuance within the deep lyrics and the haunting music being a sax player myself i was especially inspired by how fat the sounds of the saxaphones are absolutely incredible,1
chilling i have been a morphine fan for quite a while and when i heard the news of mark sandman the singer death i feared the worst no more mezmerizing beauty from the guys of morphine i recieved the night on its release date and listened to it three times right away while as a whole while the night is not the best of morphine albums this album is different enough to be in a category itself there are songs on the disc that will become legendary to morphine fans the album is simply chilling you get the usual morphine dose of sax bass drum and voice but with a new twist there are some unique sounds on this album that just adds to the sad feeling one gets when the thought reaches the brain where would morphine had gone if mark sandman had not traveled into the night thank you mark for the beauty,1
dangerous i have tried this item a few times and learned the strainer top does not hold tight to the cooker nor is there anything in the design of the cooker part to permit the strainer top to attach to it this means that when you tip the cooker over to pour out the water the top falls off danger of scalding and steam burns it worked adequately for rice vermicelli which one would normally just soak in boiling water anyway when i tried it with penne the pasta pieces on the bottom of the container did not even get wet from the hot water never mind cooked i still had to remove the pasta at the end of the so called cooking time and transfer it to a pot of boiling water in order to get it cooked this so called pasta cooker is a waste of time not a waste of money if you want to have a plastic vase for long stemmed flowers that what you can safely use it for,0
misleading information i used to geocache and so i read this book with interest the information is misleading gpsr slang of a gps receiver an initialism is hardly slang to slightly dangerous the author recommends turning off the gps for most of your trek to save batteries instead of losing your breadcrumb trail back to your camp or car why not just carry spare batteries it appeared to me that the author had never really spent much time geocaching take his advice with a grain of salt,0
a classic this is a movie that my mother took me and my siblings to when it first came out i remember loving the title and thinking it would be really scary since it was about murder and death what i remember most about it is maggie smith saying dickie where my dickie i bought it for sentimental reasons it a really great movie if only for all the stars that appear it also got truman capote who is strange and wonderful it got lots of twists and turn the introduction is a little long the piece where everyone arrives at the mansion it a little gimicky but it neil simon so that to be expected would i recommend it to others sure was i a tiny bit disappointed that it was not as wonderful as i remember it sure the last thirty years made it a little better in my mind than it actually is it got some good extras but not as many as i generally like but it a good nostalgia pick and there are some great performances,1
this is one funny movie this movie is hilarious i found it amazing because this film was truely a pionear of its genre parody this was before lethal weapon and even before the movie clue it is indeed one of the first of its kind it follows the same basic premise as most other murder mystery movies but it turns all of the stereotypes on their head for example the butler is blind and this is but one many things that make this movie unique you can tell the producer and director had a lot of fun making this one the first time you watch it you can have a dozen different guesses for how the movie turns out but you will not be right i love this movie,1
personal top NUMBER if you have not had the chance to see it then trust me and please buy it laughs are assured,1
great comedy from before foul language this movie has always been a favorite of mine i originally saw it when it came out and remember all the crazy stuff that went on later it became a thing where we would rent it every so often and watch it waiting for certain parts it draws on a great cast a strange script and sets that fit the storys mood its a film that would never be made today because they would never bring in so many great actors and hire a top notch screenplay writer its easier now to just get one known actor or a script that relies on foul language and gross jokes with whoever starring in it i enjoy that type of movie too but this is not like that this is a fun movie thats the best way to describe it,1
pathetic attempt at bond this film is awful the plot is a twisted bond film scenario with only difference being that disel is not a professional spy but recruited by the us government because he appears to be tough and at the same time a criminal the special effects were okay but very predictable and hardly believable the film also had some lines from previous bond films and even some screen shots that looked awfully similar to some of the past bond movies but diesel is no bond he as a spy and is an awkward actor at that,0
this movie is bad i was able to see this movie in europe for free and let me just say it was terrible big explosions and big stunts are the only dosis you will be getting because as far as a good story or a bit of acting is concerned not a chance unless showing off your muscles every second can be call acting vin diesel is one of the worst actors i have ever seen i wish hollywood would give a chance to real actors who are just waitingfor the opportunity please do not allow this to continue bad movies must be stopped once and for all rent this movie if it makes you happy but do not be another victim or worst yet another supporter of this movie,0
top NUMBER reasons you saw xxx NUMBER you are a girl that has a crush on vin diesel NUMBER you are a kid that has no idea who james bond is NUMBER you are a serious movie goer looking for comedy relief NUMBER you thought it was rated xxx NUMBER you are a student from the usc film class bad movies NUMBER NUMBER you had nothing better to do with your time and money NUMBER you are a first time moviegoer that was tricked by your NUMBER year old sister NUMBER you are a critic that in hot water with his boss NUMBER you believe that the wwf and wcw is a real sport NUMBER that vin diesel guy is hot even if he can not act,0
please it entertainment not reality there only one reason to see this movie entertainment it just that simple if you are looking for profound this whole movie genre is not it if your looking for fast paced action witty dialogue an edgy sound track that compliments the plot a wild unique approach to stunts and a totally unconventional irreverent secret agent then this movie is for you vin diesel makes a very entertaining believable xander cage but give him a break this is not a shakespeare movie it a spy movie and does follow the genre rules but not enough to make it like any other do not take it too seriously and enjoy the ride,1
mindless pointless and insulting bad just plain awful please skip this mindless drivel the only people who liked this film are girls who think that vin diesel is cute and people who liked fast the furious another snoozer i am glad that i saw it on my friend pc and not at the theaters so that i did not waste NUMBER NUMBER anyone who watched this film and was not insulted by its mindnumbing dialogue horrid plot and overall crudeness should be ashamed of themselves not even jean claude himself could have saved this one a total waste of time for the thinking movie goer hey kiddies here an idea instead of watching this why not see a top notch film like far from heaven or the hours or even minority report oh thats right got to use the old noggin for that one never mind it saddens me that movies have come to this,0
head for the xxx it i have only ever walked out of one movie and this was it i actually stayed for an hour hoping it get better but it actually got worse the acting bad the stunts bad the plot very bad i would not wish seeing this movie on my worst enemies even thogh i have none save your money send it to sally struthers or something,0
unleaded probably one of the most pointless films with one of the most pointless stars of today and the best thing is we can expect a sequel could someone please explain to me the appeal of vin i mean he did show some promise in far superior films like pitch black and saving private ryan but enough already,0
triple bad this movie does not even deserve one star vin diesel is the worst actor for anybody to call him the new james bond is sad and laughable say what you want about roger moore performances as james bond vin diesel could never compare to him and he was the worst james bond ever the stunts in this movie are awesome but the acting and plot is horrible i felt ashamed that i watched this movie because it insulted my intelligence this movie was so bad and to think it was a block buster hit vin is sexy although he sometimes force it but nothing and i do mean nothing should excuse him for making this mess vin do better next time,0
horrible well i saw this movie on the night of its release just like most women in this world i am a huge vin diesel fan i saw him in the fast and the furious pitch black boiler room and so on i was sadly dissapointed by this movie it was long and dry the funny parts were few and far between and there was sooo much action in it that it was almost unbearable to watch between the mediocre acting and the tired fighting scenes it leaves u drained not vin diesels finest hour i will say,0
good introductory real options book for beginner or manager it is a good introductory book on real options targeted at the audience of managers rather than experienced financial practitioners its contents covered financial options binomial pricing and black scholes model where the last ten chapters or so are case studies dedicated to applications of real options where it gives readers an idea how real options can be applied in diverse industries it makes a good and easy read for anyone who wants a quick flavor of real options without going through too much of the horrible maths that derivatives and real options seems to have i personally enjoy reading it from cover to cover,1
an american classic although this extremely gifted author did an excellent job a bit wordy for me just do not have the time to read this style of writing,1
captivating been listening to the book for the last two weeks so i feel like i am family does not get NUMBER stars because it gets a little too in love with its own voice but for the most part a really good audio book,1
deplorable this was the worst example of american literature ever published warren feels the need to describe such trivial objects as doorknobs the color of the street or smell of the rain is this really needed this book could have easily been condensed into one half its size the author continuing mention of the great twitch has no impact on the average person life this book is a waste of your time do not read it,0
pointless this book was profane and pointless as is w most books i am forced to read for english i never knew being in ap ment i had to put up with my beliefs being violated do not buy this book,0
extremely unappreciated this is definately one of the most underrated books of all time many will believe that this book is about politics but it is about life robert penn warren creates jack burden a character who is more like a spectator then one who actually lives life the writing style is wonderful and some of the lines in this novel are extremely well written and created i highly recommend this book to anyone who can survive the first chapter it is definately worth it many themes can also be drawn from this book a book that you will be thinking about long after you have finsihed,1
thou preachest too much this book has a preachy tone that current readers will find hard to take but at the core of this book there are useful truths and insights into the learning process for the good student this book will confirm what he or she already knows and may add a few additional touches to personal trouble spots for the average to poor student it may be hard to get past the school marmish tone to get to the goods this book has to offer i am afraid in today environment this book will not reach those who need it the most,0
ladies gentlemen it the rolling stones i am not the most analytical reviewer out there for some of you who want a well reasoned logically based original thought provoking review i simply like what i hear or i do not but i love music and certain bands i have loved for NUMBER years the rolling stones is one of them i picked up the cd simply because it was the rolling stones i listened to it and from the first it sounded just excellent they kept to the formula and then spiked it i am not going to compare it to past albums or group line ups or anything i can not tell you if it is better or worse than other albums this one just stands on it own if you do love the rolling stones you will be floored let me just tell you that in their golden years the stones still had the stones to pull it off again you pick this cd up for the heck of it and you walk away NUMBER satisfied that you got your money worth and unlike mick you get satisfaction what a superb rocker,1
this is a great album a thrilling display of funky brilliance and virtuosity you should listen to this album many many times like for a whole evening sipping martinis or margaritas or whatever you like to drink it one of their greats along with some girls exile on main street and the others this one is notable for the funky guitars the jazz influence and keith richards sounding like he singing in humphrey bogart bar in casablanca most importantly this album appears to have been very carefully made with a tremendous shot of inspiration and it gets better every time you hear it,1
say yes to the stones the stones were a great band and almost as goos as the beatles all their albums including this one are classics ignore the one star reviews and buy this one,1
the same thing the rolling stones are making the same music from NUMBER ago and now as multi millionaries they are playing to rebels writting songs about bush etc ths is the only way to call the media attention,0
yuk are they still alive this cd stinks they are living off media baby boomers hype when was the last time they had a hit NUMBER,0
what a bunch of trash i have been patiently waiting for some new stones and what do i finally get this group of songs some south philly garage band could have written what a disgrace for the stones to put out this lousy album i am deeply disturbed buy the fact that people are giving this rave reviews just because it a stones album be ashamed be very ashamed of yourselves for telling people this cd is worth their hard earned cash,0
oh pleeeze the lyrics on biggerbang are so bad if you have a brain you will cringe i am just one of your cocks how old are you guys musically it pretty rockin and tight i wish you could turn down jagger not because of his singing which is really good but because the lyrics seem like they were written by a fourteen year old with a big ego,0
this cd reminds me of a not good cd i was definately not ready for the disappointment i suffered when i decided to buy this instead of another tom waits cd i was very sorry to see that the early music by the cherry poppin daddies was just as god awful as all the other alternative music that i hate i like mittens,0
another winner another winner for jance in the joanna brady series i have read all of the books in the series and am currently reading the next installment dead wrong i love the joanna brady series and will not miss one jance has got a real winner here i like this series far more that the j p beaumont series also there is no need to read the other books in the series before picking up this one jance brings everyone up to speed without any confusion if you start a book in the middle of the series great characterizations and storyline,1
tl bought this cd many many years ago i can not truthfully name one song from it but i will vouch for tracy lawrence he a good singer,1
ok but there better stuff out there for the money i think this thing is sortof nice the way it has an integrated tape and cd but generally i think it is really crappy compared to the turtle beach audiotron granted that unit is designed to be connected to a real stereo and not imitate a real stereo like this unit but the support for formats and features is NUMBER better on that unit the audiotron is also able to play icecast and shoutcast,0
big disappointment anyone who saw the stage production of joseph and the amazing technicolor raincoat must be disappointed by the movie the main problem is the staging of it as a play at a school resulting in unrealistic and cutesy scenes of kids worshipfully smiling at singing adults the music is good but the narrator makes faces and danny osmond with long hair and half shaven looks like he just woke up from sleeping on the street my advice if you have this video is to close your eyes and just listen to the music,0
thumbs down all the children magically popping up some bad makeup and a few sad tries at being funny is what makes this movie deserve such a low rating i think they could have come up with a better joseph than d o i have seen it NUMBER times in live theater and every time the show was better than the movie,0
improves with age i thought this was a pretty good video in response to one comment i also was not wild about maria friedman compared to laurie beechman but i warmed up to her on my second viewing as for alternatives a great choice would have been liz callaway formerly of cats anastasia etc also i do not know how much more complete this version could have been other than the megamix which was irrelevant anyway if you have a choice get the dvd because the documentary is worth watching,1
joseph all i have to say is that i love it the music is awesome still love donny osmond and he excellent in this production,1
best musical of all time nothing better than learning a bible lesson through so much entertainment i wish there were more dvd out like this enjoy,1
can not get enough i have seen a few broadway shows in the past but when i saw joesph for the first time in salt lake city i was blown away i instantly went out and bought the dvd and every sunday my family and sit down and watch it togather the set up with the school kids watching the show in the school auditorium magical and touching go go donny and i hope to see you in salt lake city again,1
can we say overproduced i agree wholeheartedly with donald from ohio review i have been a fan of this lloyd weber rice musical for NUMBER years and have seen it grow as songs were added and various recordings made available having never had the opportunity to see the stage production i was eager to see this video now i realize that perhaps this musical is one to be heard and not seen at least not beyond an unpretentious summer camp or youth group presentation the perfect venues for this show yes osmond performs nicely in the role of joseph but everything else about this production is so overdone that watching it for me is like seeing a favorite childhood friend grow up to become a cheap circus performer the two stars i give this video are for the music itself but i certainly do not understand why lloyd weber chose to add the finale song any dream will do to the beginning of the show,0
not for children donny osmond was wonderful as always the female lead was not as strong as the cd this video is not for children the costumes in the pharoah scene are offensive and in poor taste,0
joseph and the amazing tecno dreamcoat is the best i have wanted to see this musical for the last year and was overjoyed when i heard that performances would be showing it on april NUMBER th after a gruling two weeks the big day came i watched with unblinking eyes trough the entire show i thought it was one of the greatest shows i have ever seen on performances apart from of course if i could give it higher then NUMBER stars i would though the mrs potiphar scene i have to admit was a little on the personal side it did not really show anything her servents costumes were not see through they were just white mesh with extremly small holes between the fabric thread i would recomond this to anyone that wants to watch and listen to a really upbeat musical that you just have to get up and dance to if i could find it on video around my town and if i had the money to buy it i would,1
the whole family enjoys it i saw joseph for the first time about NUMBER years ago and wondered why i waited so long to see it i took my older children then aged NUMBER NUMBER to see it two years later they loved it too they insisted i buy the soundtrack cd also an awesome thing to have and now my three year old bops around the house singing go go go joseph good music great lyrics a great evening for the entire family a must for andrew lloyd weber fans of all ages,1
eye opening version re orchestrated this is a superb visualisation of the show based on the early NUMBER london revival with jason donovan and subsequently philip schofield the production was then moved to the us where donny osmond took the title role for NUMBER or NUMBER years this version owes a lot to the original london revival production the canaan sets and the pharoah sets are practically identical to those of the stage version just fleshed out a bit the jail and potiphar offices are a new departure with a triangular theme in black white and silver what impressed me the most though was the huge involvement of the chorus in this production the chorus work also seems to have been augmented with additional harmony lines and dances all in all a reaffirmation of the stage as a medium even in video form enjoy,1
amazing things about joseph this movie was amazing i have seen the play and own the cd and this was by far better the cast has so much fun with their roles that the audience can not help but enjoy the performance donnie osmond was made for this role and maria friedman shines as the narrator i saw another review that said this was racy and distasteful for children but i found it no more inappropriate than the live performance and the scenes in question are over so fast children will hardly have time to question it i think it great for the whole family musical lovers and nonmusical lovers alike i expected it to be the taping of a live performance and was dreading the poor quality that is unavoidable in such cases like extreme facial closeups and bad lighting what a surprise this was it was nothing like i expected and better than i hoped,1
buy the soundtrack instead joseph lovers you will be disappointed with this film family viewing it is not potiphar wife and her servants are definitely r rated and you may be embarrassed to watch this with your children the narrator is breathy and sexy which may work in some venues but not when she is narrating a bible story to a grade school assembly rent it and get it over with but you will probably grate at the slow musical pace,0
i really like the story being told the actors are pretty good and they can definitely sing the biggest reason i purchased this dvd is the singing,1
a must have for aspiring colorists and lettering this is by far the most informative book i have come across for lettering and coloring comics it gives you step by step instructions on how to scan your art prep it in photoshop color it letter it and finally the clean up process heck it even goes into how to submit it to the publisher it also gives non step by step info on things such as color theory and the use of photoshop filters way better than any marvel book i have read so far,1
okay but short of expectations i got this book to accelerate my knowledge but i decided that it s not as good as other books of the same kind namely hi fi guide to coloring comics and the lettering book by comicraft i got this book because its a book about dc comics my personal favorites and i thought i would get better direction on how to do these things like they do sadly this just isnt the case the direction is just a skimming off the top and gives great history but actually i have yet to find anything helpful in it the comicraft lettering book gives you step by step in illustrator and once you learn it it sticks in your mind simple as that the hi fi book gives instruction and comes with hady texture maps to give your colors more appeal i would probably recommend this book to younger artists NUMBER and below maybe this was the age bracket it was intended for,0
some people this was a very funny movie i saw it awhile back and was just curious as to what other people thought the guys that gave it NUMBER stars definitely got it right i was reading the NUMBER star reviews and just got pissed off what wrong with people what were you expecting from this movie it was loaded with hilarious scenes you got these clowns bad mouthing the movie i suppose because i guess it was not a groundbreaking thought provoking movie get out of your own asses,1
much respect if you thought bleed debut was hot your going to get roasted to this my own has a different sound than his first record but that what makes it great he uses lots of samples from the NUMBER giving it southernplayalistic style that unmatched the message conveyed through his lyrics is more than just a mission about money and cheese and thuggin ghetto celebrities too short and daz found their way onto this record but they are an afterthought the narcotic effect of bleed southern drawl and story telling ability that spawned his first record just accelerates on my own get this if you want to listen to a message not just hear words,1
stuff is great but do not buy here cha cha mix is definitely tasty but do not buy it in bulk here because it turns rancid and you can not return food to amazon the first few bags were super but bag five which was still in code tasted nasty as did bag six i did not open any more and contacted harmony and they sent me a coupon for a free bag but that does not make up for the eight yucky ones i am stuck with,0
awesome for the year that it was made texas chainsaw massacre is a very good movie what really got me was the fact that it was based on a true story tcm NUMBER was the best out of all of them NUMBER was the lamest of all of them but opinions vary,1
the texas chainsaw massacre blu ray i was very excited to see that the movie arrived within a couple of days of purchase however i was not able to watch the movie for almost a month later due to our remodling of our living room witch houses our surround sound and tv the blu ray is just a copy of the dvd that came out a few years ago but i was fine with that since i did not own the dvd the movie was awesome and still scary just as i remembered it since i last saw it when i was a teen to my great excitement came sadness when i wanted to see the special features and they did not work i cliked on them over and over and nothing it just brought me back to the main screen again and again i do not know if this has happened to anybody else or is my copy a dud,0
this is horror no matter how many times i have watched this movie i am scared sh less i love movies that can scare me even after watching them a million times watching all the extras on the dvd did not help either i watched all the deleted scenes the bloopers even put an alternative soundtrack on the movie with gunnar hanson tobe hooper and a production designer narrating and it still scares me oh i can handle my horror but the texas chainsaw massacre is one of those films that stays with you and refuses to leave today sick jokes of horror films have nothing on tobe hooper wes craven dario argento or the rest of the horror masters,1
the saw is family i remember when i was about ten watching this movie the one thought i could not get out of my mind is that this stuff really happend from the moment that creepy guy jumps in there van and starts talking about how he worked in a slaughter house and then starts cuttin on his self the movie has your attention i really do not know what else to say that has not allready been said so i just want to say love this dvd NUMBER NUMBER,1
widescreen yes anamorphic no this is great if you have a NUMBER inch NUMBER NUMBER cathode ray tv but if you have a NUMBER NUMBER hdtv beware it will look terrible yes the supervised by tobe hooper picture is great on a small screen but the dvd is in NUMBER NUMBER letterbox not NUMBER NUMBER anamorphic so you have to zoom it to watch on an hdtv and it will look terrible it like putting in an old vhs cassette one that really deteriorated i am waiting anxiously for a real widescreen version for the modern hdtv audience,0
so scary i am young and this movies scared me for years i never have gone or looked at any supodley abandod houses very creepy a true horror film,1
absolutely terrifying i skipped this one during its drive in days but i caught up with it on video in the NUMBER s i was so primed to be scared that i watched it on a sunny saturday afternoon with all the lights on and it still scared the bejesus out of me you be surprised by how little gore there actually is and by how willing hooper is to sustain the length of a scene until you think you will leap out of your skin with anxiety the final shot against the rising sun is maybe my pick for the most memorable of any horror film it seemed to sum up everything that went before plus make you a rethink it while you are b not sleeping that night,1
good but sometimes disturbing this is a horror movie in the same vein as last house on the left well directed and not for sissy horror fans that think scream is the first slasher film yeah thats a good movie but if ya think that movie contains the same if not equal shock value you need to crawl out of your hole and rent or buy this movie and see what has been stolen from such a fine director the acting is so amateur that it works in both the comedic range and the serious the makeup is incredibly real so that if it had been done in black and white the film would have been just as effective and the camerawork nothing less than brilliant it up there with psycho the original hitchcock as well as the remake gus van sandt this is real hideyoureyes terror made to be watched alone in the dark in the daylight as well beware the meathook,1
the greatest horror film of all time tobe hooper NUMBER landmark masterpiece debut the texas chainsaw massacre is by far the single most influential horror film of all time this is the holy grail of horror movies when i was a kid this movie changed my life i have been a horror movie addict ever since this film is the ultimate blue print on how to make a great horror movie there are many films that contain much more blood gore then t c m to the eye of the beholder there may even be films out there that are more scary then t c m maybe but what makes this film numero uno of all horror films is simpley the amount of influence it has contributed to the horror world its this reason this reason alone that texas chainsaw massacre is the best there was the best there is the best there ever will be,1
dumb dumb and dumb this is by far the worse horror movie ever the acting is pathetic the killer is a total idiot the camera footage suckz and theres no story line that goes with it itz just about a guy that kills people with a chainsaw i rented this movie and instantly regreted it pleaze do not do not buy this movie and if u do yer screwed,0
mt great great uncle i only bought this because my great great uncle ross santee was featured in it for about NUMBER seconds the video was made in NUMBER when color had just come out and the quality of the color is awful shadows in people faces are green the story line is so basic any kid could predict the ending still it was well worth NUMBER for me to have a tiny bit of memorabilia of my long distant family member,0
despite great acting by de niro this movie sucks let me start by saying that i had high hopes for this film some people praise it like it as good as taxi driver after watching it though i have no clue what people see in this movie it drags on and on and at some points of the film espcially the middle you really have no idea what is going on anymore i almost felt like shutting it off a few times but luckily de niro acting kept me from hitting the stop button i am sure when this movie came out it was shocking and disturbing since there was not much like it back then however by today standards it really falls flat on it face i would not recommend this film to anyone although if you are really curious about it feel free to give it a try obviously there are those who like really bizarre pointless movies like this just do not say i did not warn you,0
all star cast but i saw this movie in my local video store and i got excited i saw huge names keitel de niro scorsese what would you expect so i got home called a couple of friends over and we sat and watched this movie this was possibly the most disappointing movie of all time i am not kidding at all i seriously felt dumber after watching this movie there was absolutely no plot i do not know how all these people are prancing around calling it one of the greatest hits of the NUMBER s no keep in mind i am a huge keitel as well as de niro fan i was so disappointed with this movie but the problem was there was absolutely no plot and no transition the actors played their characters well but there was no room for characters in the movie it was a huge upset does not do this movie justice no plot no culmination no action no transition no story period,0
top notch this film is shot well has a great soundtrack and is definitely a great early piece by scorsese there no real obvious plot line but it still a fun movie,1
great when i was a little kid i would try to watch these movies but they really freaked me out now that i am NUMBER i had to give this one a try freddy dead was on television and once i saw one part with freddy and carlos carlo ear it freaked me out but now i watched the whole movie of this and i have to buy the NUMBER disc box collection i just special ordered it this movie was really good i can not wait to see all the other movies even that one part in nightmare NUMBER with carlos maybe this time i do not think it would be as bad but i think everyone should give this movie a try wes craven is very creative i have seen his other work like wishmaster NUMBER and he done pretty good job check this one out,1
this is not a good movie if your a die hard fan and saw them all you may like it otherwise be warned it not good the twisting of reality with robert englund appearing as himself and wes craven cameo just did not add the renewal of life that they had hoped it not really scary either which i thought was kind of a requirement in these horror movies,0
what was the point of this talk about beating a dead horse how much further can the freddy thing get stretched the idea of a character from the movies real because he was so evil is ludicrous at best it would be like walking into NUMBER and bumping into darth vadar as you were filling up your big gulp robert englund was happy to make this i am sure i mean after awhile people started calling him freddy everywhere he went what else was he going to do make cereal or laundry soap commercials stick with the original series this was stupid,0
he back three years after the apparent death of the striped sweater wearing madman original creator wes craven comes back to bring more fear to elm street but this time the terror does not stop at the screen this is a movie inside of a movie freddy coming into reality because the movies have ended i love the return of the original cast members i love the freddy character in this movie more than i have since part NUMBER because he actually kind of frigtening again and i think that the story is well executed i commend you wes craven but on a sad note i miss the old freddy look and i most certainly miss the what the hell reaction i got watching the originals reality sort of complicates things but hey i like the movie alot,1
good this is a really great movie it might even be the best in the series even if the first one in like this classic,1
queen of hell i only saw about a third of this movie but i thought it rocked and i think freddy oughtta get a girl just not heather as that one guy suggested anyway my question is how can a kid sleepwalk with his eyes open if he completely aware of what going on around him maybe i am misintrepreting but i saw this movie when i was nine four years ago and i recall dylan sleepwalking into the middle of the street on his way home from the hospital and kreuger grabbing him from the sky the kid was wide awake so how the heck did kreuger do it i mightta missed something though i loved the movie and i am going to work on that whole bride of kreuger idea this one guy had buh bye,1
re discover your music collection this is a fantastic product i am not a technical guy so i was a bit apprehensive when i ordered the cd songwriter was i happily surprised i took it out of the box read the easy to follow directions plugged it in and immediately i was rocking the house with lp and cassettes i literally had not heard in years the cd player and radio are likewise terrific simple to use and the sound is great burning cd use blank cd r not cd rw is also a snap a rick springfield cassette i bought in NUMBER sounds brand new burned onto cd with the crosley songwriter a dylan thomas poetry album my mom bought in the NUMBER s likewise sounds crystal clear on a newly burned cd i am so pleased with this songwriter i feel like a kid on christmas morning baby boomers gen treat yourselves to this wonderful machine and rediscover your music collection,1
national geographic africa series beautifully photographed however if you are interested in africa from a political and historical standpoint as i am this is not really the video series for you excellent wildlife and nature footage just as you expect from national geographic and even an attempt to convey some sociological lessons about urban vs tribal differences overall well worth watching but do not look to it for very deep historical or political enlightenment about the continent,1
if this cd does not perk you up you are dead a fun cd from beginning to end starts out with the radio hit zoot suit riot a very catchy tune with plenty of brasswork that does not sound too serious or too contrived the lyrics reflect the swing era roots but contain modern phrases and topics some a little risque very tight execution of the genre every song has a little hook or element that is straight from the swing era the lyrics are clever and descriptive with a lot of detail a good cd for either serious headphone listening or to just put on in the background,1
damm good swing cd this is a damm good swing cd do not listen to the other reviews saying that its ska there are only traces of ska in tracks such as dr bones and pink elephant the band is excellent but they do have a habit of adding extra horns and a piano player do not get me wrong these sound great but it makes me wonder if they would sound as good live as for the lyrics some may find them offensive but in that case do not buy the cd my opinion i thought that the lyrics fitted in well with the songs and the style of music if you like neo swing and bands such as big bad voodoo daddy and royal crown revue then this cd is defiantly for you,1
you call this swing listen up all you people who think you know swing this ai not nothin this is not swing this is something i do not know with a name attached to it you want some real swing try the classics the real thing like benny goodman glenn miller gene krupa artie shaw listen to them the real thing this is just a modern excuse for music,0
this cd will make you want to get up and swing dance the songs are full of catchy phrases and brilliantly made the cherry poppin daddies picked all the right hits to be on the album especially my favorite zoot suit riot,1
zoot suit riot is the best song on the album this album is pretty good not as good as i had hoped zoot suit riot is definitely the greatest song on the album other ones like come back to me are also good but it does not live up to the expectations i had overall a good album but not perfect,1
was not very impressed especially after all the hype i bought this cd after hearing the title song for the hundreth time on the radio thinking maybe the whole cd would be as good boy was i wrong i would return it if amazon would take an opened cd back,0
the best album of NUMBER period the cpd are by far the best band alive in america today zoot suit is the best cd of the year on stage i have never seen a band more charged and on fire than the cpd all other swing is boring lounge music compared to zoot suit steve perry is one of the top three lyric writers on my personal list making their music all the more enjoyable the lyrics are complex intelligent morally pointed and clever the music is rich catchy diverse and incorporates more instruments than other swing bands the cpd are definitely not smooth and syrupy like other bland bands they have the same demented spastic gusto they started out with years ago and are only going to get hotter all other bands including the masters of days gone by swing with all due respect of course are left foundering in the wake of the cpd,1
oh yeah with the great beat good lyrics and skilled players they are simply the best the worst complaint i have heard is that you got to know a little about the NUMBER to get the lyrics mista s,1
awful stuff i agree with the two previous reviewers this is indeed horrendous fake swing that does not hold a candle to the original masters it is also grate not great modern swing,0
swinging and swearing do not mix these losers have a brain dead idea they trot out the old swing jump sound of the NUMBER s then figure that in order to update it for the NUMBER s they better add some downer lyrics and foul language this is the modern NUMBER s idea of fun i guess no thanks if i want to listen to swing i will stick with the original masters do yourself a favor and buy a duke ellington fletcher henderson or even a louis prima cd and you will see how lame these neo swing pretenders are,0
there much better modern swing out there the swingin sounds on this may rock but the swingin words on zoot suit riot are simply awful abuse and swing just do not go together this stuff is supposed to be fun not miserable go listen to the squirrel nut zippers or brian setzer orchestra instead,0
absolutely love hoku i bought hoku cd years ago i did not even know who she was but i was young and pretty much bought any cd i am now almost NUMBER and i still listen to her cd repeatedly i know every word to every song i noticed that someone reviewed her song another dumb blonde with bad feedback that person does not know music hoku music is about love and how a girl can overcome a guy then she has a song about someone being there for her always through thick and thin you frist believed is my all time favorite its a touching song and reminded me of someone i know if i had one last wish before i died it would be to meet hoku and her father don ho she is incredibly beautiful and very talented i have done kareoke many times and most of which i was singing her songs i am without a doubt hoku number NUMBER fan i love you hoku amanda,1
hoku is a hit with children five and under that is hoku ridicousily stupid another dumb blonde is possibly one of the stupidest songs ever writen hoku did not even write the song and the melody and lyrics are horid hoku is no small package thoiugh she two doughnuts away from NUMBER the title alone states perfectly what she is another dumb blonde,0
another dumb blonde although she might say she not it painfully obvious hoku is another dumb blond the only reason she gets those NUMBER star reviews is cuz people are so tired of dumb blond singers that they want to believe thet she different she danses like a moose,0
great cd excellent music that carries a fantasic sense of place to my knowledge kyle thompson is the only musician ever to record civil war era music on location at different battlefields thompson is a talented musician and the fact that he had been diagnosed with lou gherig disease by the time of the recording something i found out after hearing the cd just made it that much more poignant the music on the cd is a balanced mix of lighter and darker music the joy and humor come through in the upbeat songs while the tragedy and sadness of the war comes through the solemn pieces in a way that more glib nauseously cheery musicians would never be able to communicate,1
still the best this album is awesome i love the song dive this song kinda reminds me one of the songs that i used to sing in my church youth group he always sings how a true christian or should i say disciple should feel especially in the song the change i saw him in concert in california i was sixteen years old the feeling that i had while i was at that concert was the best i own all his albums he never disapoints me he is the main reason i listen to christain music,1
building the custom home office this has to be the worst book i have ever seen on the subject NUMBER pages dealing with one home office layout concept and this is from NUMBER very difficult to get ideas as it deals with one outdated office concept and explains how to build the components from scratch in this day and age most components can be bought it is the ideas that are needed useless book do not know how it had over NUMBER stars when i bought it,0
a cornerstone in brass band funk i first got this album in NUMBER i was immediately hooked this album is a cornerstone of music that the dirty dozen brass band have helped bring back to the spotlight one of my all time favorites,1
korean movie the great queen seondeok great movie well directed and true historic account of the life of the queen great action and plot not like some of those cheap chinese movies,1

writers you need this book whether you are a beginning writer or an established author this book gives solid advice i love how you can read the book from cover to cover or just flip to a section that you want to know about right now keep it handy and reference it often karen reddick author of grammar done right,1
their lesbian schtick is running thin god this music is soooo annoying and did not britney already do the schoolgirl thing they can only kiss each other while performing so many times before everyone gets tired of it boring,0
the most enjoyable album of all time this has to be one of the most amazing cd ever britney spears only wishes she could make music like this great pop beats with meaningful lyrics align all the songs here coming from someone who loves madonna stevie nicks michael jackson this is one of my favorite cd of all time i absolutley love each song to pieces the album is very dark pop electro and it enhoyable from start to finishmy favorite songs are how soon is now stars NUMBER minutes and of course the classic not going to get us and all the things she said buy this album you have to listen to it it phenomenal,1
tatu russian music comes to the usa folks for several years the russian music scene has exploded with a wealth of talent tatu is not the best russian group but they are pretty good their music is very catchy and if you listen to the russian versions they are even more hypnotic according to people in russia tatu is a kids band a little NUMBER nd rate but what the heck the songs are great good melodies i sing to them my only problem is i heard them first as russian songs now they have been transformed into english perhaps someday the usa will be graced by even better artists like alsou safina someone who is a serious singer and can sing extrememly well,1
these girls are definetely going to get you talk about amazing these girls are definetely worth listening to a couple months ago my friend talked me into downloading one of their songs i caved in and did so i listened to just a little clip of them and i was immediately hooked these girls have amazing voices and you can definetely tell their heart and souls are in their music i also think it awesome that they are open about their sexuality these girls are not ashamed and i believe that awesome these girls have awesome tracks like all the things she said a nice cover of how soon is now and one of my favs malchik gay if you feel like putting yourself in a good mood and feel like dancing then i definetely recommend this cd get them now it well worth it,1
not worth it taped extended super long play inaudible inaudible particularly for gollum talking and some of the songs glitches appear in the taping including soem sections where the sound drops off for a second in the middle of a sentence not re digitized not worth it perhaps other reviews refer to a different version of the movie,0
did not see it yet but not buying it it is not fair to call this a review because i have not watched the dvd due to having seen several reviews here and on other websites regarding the lack of good audio and the sadly recrafted movie i refuse to buy it i love the hobbit from my childhood i have been searching for months for the movie in dvd for my kids and after reading several reviews i know myself well enough to choose to avoid the deep disappointment that others have related about this particular dvd i just want the same movie i watched as a kid on a dvd is that too much to ask,0
great cartoon horrible quality this cartoon was one of my favorites when i was a kid so now that i have got kids of my own i bought a dvd copy to watch with them unfortunately the dvd is the worst analog to digital transfer i have ever seen it has a very flat appearance the colors are lifeless not vivid like the original they should fire the guy who made this dvd version it looks like a cheap bootleg maybe even worse do not buy this dvd until they re release it with a proper analog to digital transfer also i think they edited parts out of the original cartoon i rarely ever rate anything on amazon but this is so bad i felt like i had to warn other people if you have still got a vhs player the vhs version of the film looks great,0
over whelmed with a sense of its own importance seeing this film successfully kept me from reading anything by tolkien for over ten years after i had read the hobbit i was able to watch it and laugh more often than i felt appaled the film lacks the quiet dignity of the book and feels heavy handed watching it i could only think of the phrase bilbo gump the progress the character of bilbo makes in the book is lost in film and we are left with a hero who wanders through his various adventures which apparently have very little effect on anything aside from his financial situation and as an extra side note the music feels ridiculous,0
missing sounds how annoying for the first time in my life i wish i had a vhs copy even with the dvd released i first noticed a problem when the first spider dies in the movie and there is no vortex sound effect then the entire scene in lake town is muted the arrows are silenced the dragon roars as a mouse and the fire it crackles as a loud annoyance i wish i had read the reviews online prior to purchasing now i am stuck with a poor quality dvd i will be buying the vhs shortly,0
the dvd sound is totally unacceptable the dvd omits all ambient noise in the movie including smaug fire his whooshing noise over the village the arrows plinking wolves howling etc it is very disturbing to those who are familiar with the video version and if i could i would ask for my money back,0
moives on parade do not order its worst copy of hobbit i have seen this moive over NUMBER times and thats no exageration being born in NUMBER i remember this film in the theatres and has been a favorite ever since and is a family favorite with my kids today this the hobbit the original unedited NUMBER animated classic as advertised it a complete lie the film is edited and missing scences not whole scences mind but enough to make it seem it was chopped to be compadible for t v and its commercials to fit in a time slot not only that the colar is quite faded and not sure if it is due to a poor quality dvd that the moive was downloaded recorded on but there is a glich a repeator skip of NUMBER NUMBER second as bilbo spaeks to gandalf and others i will never order on amazon again how can they call it the original unedited classic when it is not save your money for the real version,0
great version of j r r tolkein the hobbit bilbo baggins voiced by orson bean is a hobbit that goes on a simple quest with gandolf john huston and a bunch of dwarfs that must find gold from the evil dragon smaug a highly entertaining and all around fun yet excellent rankin bassfilm which is one of the best they did with return of the king the last unicorn and flight of dragons also recommend lord of the rings NUMBER return of the king and lord of the rings fellowship of the rings,1
terrible dvd sound avoid the dvd whether you like the original movie or not the dvd version soundtrack is missing a very large number of key elements the majority of the sound effects ambient sound backgrounds some of the music and even the occaisional bit of dialogue the result is like watching an unfinished movie with a temp audio track a truly horrendous offense for an animated movie which depends so much on sound do not buy the dvd you are not really getting the movie as advertised,0
disappointed what a bummer first off it was late getting here even though it was sent NUMBER day prime so it barely made it for christmas the worst part is the poor quality of the dvd it skipped in several places brand new out of the case first time in the player and it skipped the quality of the movie is awful too you think if it was that bad to begin with it would not have been transferred to a dvd to begin with,0
a review post viewing of the hobbit overall it was great i being a hardcore tolkien fan judged the movie with an extremely critical eye the songs were well done and the animation was o k it really only has one plot conflict that being that they totally left out beorn oh yeah the elves could have been portrayed better they look like blue ants that got tangled up in the machinery of a textile mill gollum was wonderful,1
terrible dvd transfer my experience has been in line with several others here sounds are missing from the original version some sounds repeat there are several points where the dvd appears to skip and replay a short sequence that it just played the colors are extremely poor the cave scenes are supposed to be darker but here we struggled to actually see anything that was happening i like the film but the quality of this transfer is just unacceptable do not buy,0
unwatchable the animated hobbit has for years been one of my all time favorites unfortunately the quality of this dvd is similar to what you would get if you copied a worn vhs tape onto a disk the movie is so dark in many places you can only see dim shapes moving about the theme song even has a skip in it and there are a number of other skips in the soundtrack there are also several places where a second or so of the movie is duplicated and repeated i have no idea how they messed that up if i had purchased it locally i would return it but i guess i will keep it until they decide to fix this dvd and reissue it hopefully on a blu ray my recommendation is do not purchase this version unless you really can not live without a copy any copy,0
now thats what i call a bible fantastic it arrived yesterday NUMBER miles to england in under NUMBER days from ordering well done amazon when i opened it i thought here at last is the bible i have been looking for for years,1
print size is NUMBER NUMBER not NUMBER NUMBER i had to return mine due to inaccurate description NUMBER NUMBER is unreadable for me,0
perfect sized bible i bought this bible as a gift and i was completely thrilled with it it is small enough to carry with you but large enough for at home study the print was larger than i expected and the pages were not too thin the cover work was very nicely done my friend was very pleased with this bible,1
caution before downloading the kindle touch version has been problematic for me i can find no table of contents and no listing for the all important abbreviation needed for this book i appreciate that the download was free now i know why discouraged,0
tiny font i bought the esv single column legacy imitation leather bible based on the stated font size of NUMBER points when i received the bible i could barely read the text even with reading glasses i could not read the even smaller footnotes i measured the capital letters and found them to be NUMBER NUMBER inch high according to wikipedia the current font standard is NUMBER point NUMBER NUMBER inch that should make a NUMBER point font NUMBER NUMBER inch high even the old font standard has the NUMBER point font in the NUMBER NUMBER inch range other than the font the bible seems to have good quality use of the very large margins should allow the publisher to use a full NUMBER point font without increasing the page count the bible was promptly returned,0
good cheap bible for travel no footnotes or references just your basic bible it nice and small but still readable fits right in my purse the only complaint i have is that i left it in my jeep during the summer and the cover curled up pretty bad but not bad for the price,1
great for gifts super handy and looks legit even though it trutone and because it less than NUMBER it makes great gifts i have bought quite a few just to give away to my fellow church goers,1
too long the book is too long and contains some unnecessary kill crazy parts certainly good for historical reference but i would not reccomend this as a source of spiritual or even moral inspiration,0
yamaha ipod dock easy to connect gui display is clear and easily readable from a distance and the remote of my yamaha rx v NUMBER is responsive you can select the option to charge as well you have to enable video output to see the video on another monitor the only thing it does not seem to do is to go the next level up from music i e video photos via the remote you can manually watch video photos if you have those features on your ipod by physically using the click wheel and then you can stop start the video with the remote that last shortcoming prevents it from attaining a NUMBER,1
still have not received it i have not yet received this camera ordered at beginning of september my emails to EMAIL are bounced back to me and i can not find a way to contact amazon regarding this item so i guess i am just out the money sent,0
could have been better i am sorry to say i read about half of it until i gave up and skipped to the end and partially read the last chapter i do not know what it was about the book that just did not keep me hooked thankfully i got it from the library so it did not cost me anything hopefully sigaloff next book will entertain me more,0
this film had a point to make but we lose interest right from the beginning because the film is so boring we do not really care to know what the point was ash wednesday is about a middle aged woman who is undergoing a middle age crisis elememts of which include her having an extensive plastic surgery and a young lover it is a we have to value what we have got sort of thing except for the great henry fonda who appears only in couple of scenes all actors are complete ham i did not feel any genuine emotion coming from the screen i did not laugh and i was not entertained on my list these are the characteristics of a bad movie i am sorry to hurt the feelings of all die hard elizabeth taylor fans she is a true star but even her costumes could not save this film it is dull and pretentious,0
great remote mount radio this radio has the same features that most NUMBER radios have yet it less than NUMBER the full channel scanning and dualwatch work great and to be such a compact unit with such a small speaker the audio sounds good if you will be driving with the windows down go ahead and plan for an external speaker but for any other time the built in speaker works great once setup with a tuned antenna the transmit and receive are both great a great radio for a great value,1
inspired movie i saw this movie on tbn channel last night and it was good to the previous reviewer and anyone who is interested you can get this movie in dvd format from world wide pictures homepage URL i am going to order one from there today,1
can i give it NUMBER stars repin harlem to the fullest this is a remarkable book mr thomas you did your thang this is the first real grown up book i read back in NUMBER i was sooo open i wanted to know everything that happened next piri was wild and knowing that this is an autobiography it even more exciting i love the way he represented the areas i have lived in or even went to school in piri told life how it really was and how it took him to learn about it growing up in spanish harlem put me on to a lot of hispanics denying their african culture it true how some parents like piri had act the same way as they did i had the pleasure of meeting piri thomas at my school in spanish harlem also it was remarkable to picture such a character then really see him face to face although he was much much older but it was still amazing this book is raw and it an absolute page turner let me tell you from a young black teenager in harlem this is a very good book an absolute page turner,1
encounter with alien man i would not recommend space aliens took me to their planet to those who disbelieve that the earth is being visited by spaceships piloted by god like people because this book depicts such an encounter that took place in NUMBER in france the book emphasis is upon the alien extensive message concerning mankind origins mankind religions mankind future etc if i were to only judge the insights that this book provides into the awesome technology and power exhibited by aliens a well as the awesome influence that aliens can wield upon human beings i would have to give the highest rating available five stars however i will only give this book one star because another book entitled the sacred and the profane written by desiree ntolo published in NUMBER and available from amazon com exposes the dangerously evil intentions that form the basis of the alien message,0
you got to know when to fold em kenny ugh kenny rogers doing a whitney houston ballad he does not have the voice for any of these songs stick to what you know kenny,0
short summary these guys look like a couple of crackheads especially the one on the left sad how they are being paid for this garbage i guess a jr high school diploma and knowing your drugs gets you far in the atl enjoy being rich and ignorant,0
breathtaking cinematography invasive music NUMBER hour too long one of the most beautifully filmed movies in recent years the beauty of the images is about all there is to recommend here the manipulative music is far too loud and sappy ethan hawke is a robot scott hicks commentary is one of the most boring on any dvd far too long the only thing keeping your finger from the fast forward button are the images themselves,0
basically to kill a mockingbird with different ethnicity would have given it a NUMBER star but the production values were gorgeous cinematography music score sound set decoration however very hard to follow with numerous flashbacks in flashbacks i think i did not read the book so i did not know the story but the author seems to have channeled another famous book all the actors seemed put out to have shown up without any intrest in fleshing out their chracters no chemistry inter play with any of the characters slowwwwwwww,0
impassioned drudgery this movie though it tells a compelling story it simply filled with drudgery i have not read the book and still may but i also consider the story line to be absolutely full of a race baiting mentality i do not recommend snow falling on cedars,0
nibbling on kelp snow falling on ceders has all the warmth and cheer of the wet dismal cold and foggy weather of the region utterly depressing the plot is plodding and stale no surprises none of the characters can one identify or sympathise with that every group is bigoted is nothing new the ending not worth waiting for scenery is lovely as usual but the only redeeming feature of this film is that it portrays the region as it was that began dying out as i was born the lumber industry and fishing are no longer what they once were the ferry boats and strawberry fields are still there but tourism is now the biggy,0
blu ray please i really enjoy this movie i have not read the book but the storyline in the movie is excellent i would buy this on blu ray in a heartbeat if it were to become available my only fault with the movie is that in my opinion the overdubbed voice overs not sure exactly what you call them toward the end seem a little overbearing,1
a true stinker cinematography is just one ingredient of a good film not thewhole recipe this was a story with so much promise yet it insistedon becoming eye candy rather than a good movie end,0
great work of fiction its a shame this book fails in its promise to expose a conspiracy but it makes for some good fiction the author seems to feel that fdr was a communist and the reason he allowed pearl harbor to be attacked is to spread communisim around the world i was left confused and bewilderd by mr willey arguments as most of the evidence presented was taken out of order or mixed and matched to fit his argument,0
celica NUMBER gts no body kit this fits pretty well and does not stick out off the back very much at all it does slightly press upwards on my bumper this could be from a previous accident so i do not want to dock more than one star install is a little bit of a pain because of the angle to get the original brackets off but i did it on my own in a parking lot i use it to be able to take bikes with me and still have some space for people other stuff i used this bike rack allen deluxe NUMBER bike hitch mount rack NUMBER NUMBER or NUMBER inch receiver,1

great movie i am not sure why people have been giving this movie such low ratings i highly recommend the dvd version the artistic effects were absolutely brilliant although the story tends to drag on at times and the acting could have been better i believe it is worth watching i rent it before buying it,1
not true to history or joan of arc save your time and money avoid this movie i have studied the life of joan of arc and was extremely disappointed by this movie the messenger portrays joan as a mental case who was unsure of herself and full of doubts the record is clear that the real joan was confident in her faith and in her voices also the movie has many scenes of graphic violence that are purely gratuitous and unnecessary yes war is violent but to include scenes of a head exploded by a giant wreaking ball adds nothing i do not recommend this movie to anyone who is serious about learning about joan of arc get the NUMBER ingrid bergman movie it is much closer to the true story for the best version of the real story read mark twain book this movie is an insult to a young woman who is quite possibly the most remarkable person who ever lived aside from jesus,0
miscast this movie was NUMBER perfect except faye dunaway should have caked some make up on and played joan of arc herself she has limitless talents and would have brought the movie what is was missing a truly spiritual heroine i am telling you faye dunaway was born to play this part one can only hope of a re make and soon,0
well it was okay i ran into blockbuster excited to watch this movie i am a big fan of joan and i like many others had big expectations for the movie this movie was done the wrong way in many ways possible who made the idea to have joan of arc the savior of the republic of france to make her into a total lunatic i know she had a minor case of epilepsy but she not no emily rose in case you do not know emily rose she was a girl who was a epileptic that was so intence she was supposely possessed by demons how can u do such a thing they made joan so annoying i did not want to watch it no more the action was not good at all u could tell some of the cast of the movie were atheists because they made it look like those signs were not real those signs were left by god and they were not by coincedence do not bother pick it up and if you do i doubt u will watch it again this is the miami reviewer peace,0
very historical this movie combines aspects from the true story of joan of ark into a fighting fest and i love it the battle scenes are nice and gore with blood coming from every part of those peoples bodys but it does try to tie history in it joan of ark is potrayed to be a nice warrior millia jovovich is a great actor this movie got me very interested in joan of ark this is one of my favorite movies ever,1
the messenger the story of joan of arc well as a student of history this movie is to say the least pittiful the acting is so bad some of the fighting sequences are laughable the young women who plays joan should go back to acting school she only seems to have two levels crazy and crazy screaming the only good thing about the film were the sets and costumes,0
great music bad recording this session was recorded in ohio in NUMBER i do not know what kind of recording equipment was used but the sound is terrible,0
fantastic book a wonderfully written book a superb plot great characters interesting setting a classic a must read one of my NUMBER favorite works of fiction maybe even better than shogun,1

not as good as i was hoping when i considered buying this for my car and started looking at the reviews i knew it was going to be a toss up wether it was going to be a quality product or not i liked that it had the front firing speaker and the soundtracker system which the radio i have in my tractor for work cobra NUMBER also has the soundtracker system and it works great but when i recieved it and set it up with a NUMBER ft wilson antenna its performance was less then exceptional radio is very noisy even with the soundtracker system on this radio constantly freezes when i turn it on it will be stuck on ch NUMBER and you will not be able to change channels use the weatherband or anything you have to turn it off and hope for the best next time you turn it on and the front firing speaker is very quiet i should have went with another cobra NUMBER and just bought an external speaker,0

adoption message this is a fun wholesome movie it also provides a starting point for discussing adoption with children even if children are not adopted they will certainly meet others who are this movie presents adoption in a positive light an attitude which i believe even young children can begin to emulate,1
a sure favorite at the day care this is one of the most requested movies at our day care center and certainly one of my personal favorites everybody in the movie is wonderful mr and mrs little geena davis is really great big brother george snowbell the impostor mom dad mouse family everybody is great just i really can not stand stuart that much gasp maybe it is just that he is so naive he jus thinks everybody loves him or maybe it is just that he is so stupid as to think that the little were so glad to get rid of him they cut his picture out and he believes snowbell i know i know that is the whole point of the story but it bothers me a little so i give little NUMBER stars and well maybe NUMBER and a half,1
suartlittle they do not talk about funny stuffsthey do not pretend to be dead they do not go fast with a car can not put them to a jail can not have a hot rideca not go full blast with a car,0
not necessarily for kids my two young children enjoyed watching this movie but i was very disappointed when i heard the cats swearing i do not want my children to pick up and mimic that language thinking that it cute and fun because it is from this movie the mice and cats are very cute and well done but the cursing did not add anything to what should have been a family show for cute animals there are better movies to watch,0
too bad no one read the book this movie called stuart little because its title character is a mouse not because it has anything to do with e b white book of the same name i felt like i was watching a re telling of annie rather than seeing a film version of a great story a typical result of creating a giant marketing and merchandising machine,0
a somewhat entertaining historical account given my odd sense of humor i was not suprised that i liked this book while tragic the deaths accounted for remind us that when we are dealing with nature we must deal with it on its own rules the pedestrians have the right of way attitude will not cut it out there folks of course some deaths were not the result of the individuals foolishness but also by accident or bad luck,1
george b i see this highly rated and do not understand how that can be unless screen visibility is of no concern to those reviewers look before you buy this one i never recommend this NUMBER because of the single issue that the display is unusable in daylight barely marginal for inside viewing it a shame because the sound is good maybe that why at t gives them away free hoping to get rid of them,0
not very good i am not a huge fan of medieval literature and perhaps this book is to blame i think i have been spoiled by the norton and bevington anthologies i have used in other classes because this was truly a let down if you are a prof looking for a good book to use for class have your students spend the extra twenty spot and get a norton,0
good i am very satisfied with the product it came in a good time and the customer service provided was great,1
dated and cheerful is how i describe this book which means there are better and more up to date ideas around on how you can manage time and life i found the ideas dated and the author style prescriptive much better value highly practical and with some innovative ideas is mark forster get everything done and still have time to play,0
okay but derivative lots of interesting examples but too many of them seem to come from a right wing perspective also the book which is humorless reminds me of other better done accounts of the same areas the lessons of the book should be applied to the book itself it does not fare well if this is done,0
complete waste of time film the premise seemed alluring saving the world in secret by use of time travel to the future but nothing makes much sense in this movie all of the charactors can not think past their nose what drives them on oh yeah their unknown b actors getting paid to play in a truly pathectic sci fi like most reviewers i tend not to write about somthing that really just sucks but i had to this time cause this one pissed me off so i have seen many b movie sci fi but this one takes the cake of all the movies waiting to be transfered to dvd what exec booted this one into production must be another groopie friend of peter fonda i thought with fonda name attached to it it could not be half bad but was i wrong,0
everything is better with jello good to hear that there is someone out there that popular in the clubs but maintains a message and logic unfortuanatly i am sure most of the fans do not have a clue as to what half there songs are about not unlike dead prez skinny puppy antipop consortium jeru da damaja krs one etc everybody just wants to dance and be entertained as the world around them falls apart anyhow rants aside this is a very this album it has a very motown kind of sound to it though i am sure that is just synths and not actual instruments regardless the m c is good the words hard hittting and like i say jello biafra from the dead kennedys is on it you can not go wrong,1
bad book this book was bad in organization setup explanation and examples if you want a good java book lewis and loftus is great i regretfully have to buy big java another horstman great for a class i sure hope its better than this one,0
remember children it only the concepts calm down calm down the title of this book has neither in a week nor in NUMBER hours and certainly not while you drive to work in its title it teaches you the and of java programming it does not cover io in detail nor threads nor games programming when you have finished this book then you will be ready to tackle those difficult topics that are well covered by reilly animal series the main theme running through the book is the progressive development of an interactive bank account i can recommed this book to absolute beginners or those not familiar with object orientated programming bonus points go to the first half of the book minus points go to coverage of io,1
barely useful flimsy construction indoor display is hard to read at most angles and the remote unit only has a temperature sensor no hygrometer which was not clear from the product description,0
could have been better i bought this book for the unique spreads and read it thoroughly i would have liked to see explanations for why the cards are laid out in certain order and places i thought the questions were too specific and would be difficult to answer with numerous cards interesting spreads good subject matter not well executed or explained at all please rewrite the book ms abraham and i will buy it again,0
great product ui could be improved i have had this product for at least six years i love the functionality we receive a good number of thunderstorms in our area so the audible alert can be a hassle but the fact i can set it to only alert visually is great we have a vacation home so i add the county number for that location when we are there most of those alerts are snow related and it really saved me once because we do not receive local stations there and a big snowstorm popped up out of the bright blue sky i originally gave it five stars but knocked it down because of the user interface i am a techie and i can pick up an object i have not touched in a while and operate it however i always forget how to add a county number and it takes me a few minutes to figure it out maybe they have already improved it since mine is so old,1
great radio nearly invisible instructions the os wr NUMBER is a terrific radio especially considering the price here on amazon it is essential to have a reliable weather radio since mid mississippi is subject to killer tornadoes and fearsome thunderstorms i will certainly feel safer with this one close by my only complaint the instruction sheet is printed in a typeface so small i had to enlarge it on a copy machine in order to read it while the instructions are clear the layout is sensible and the programming relatively simple trying to decipher NUMBER point type made the whole experience needlessly frustrating guys your radio is a really good one why diminish a fine product with nearly invisible and thereby unreadable instructions,1
disapointed i was never really able to get this unit working after thinking i had installed weak batteries i discovered that the only way to keep the unit powered was to apply pressure to the battery cover compartment additionally i found installing batteries annoying due to a very thin peice of weather stripping that easily falls out of place and is not amenable to being replaced i returned this item,0
sealy best fit NUMBER thread count cotton sateen sheet set purchased this set of sheets on april NUMBER NUMBER only two months ago the fitted sheet have started piling which indicates not a good quality set of sheets the only thing that i loved about these sheets is the fitted sheet and how it hugs the mattress for the price of these sheets the quality is just not there the sheets that these replace were NUMBER years old and just started ripping two months is unacceptable sincerely jody m becnel,0
ouch first of all i must agree that these are the best fitting sheets you may ever find in your life but unless you love sleeping on the beach with nothing between you and clumpy gritty sand do not buy them after several washings the fabric is truly so rough that it hurts there is a fatal flaw the fabric and the manufacturer must change it if it wants repeat customers summary fit is fantastic sheets are terrible do not buy them,0
like the idea behind the phone but not this one this is my second cordless phone with a headset this one i can not hear out of i contacted the seller rainbow barter and they said all sales were final so i tried to contact ibm sat on the phone NUMBER minutes the first time on hold was disconnected and i am sitting again NUMBER minutes maybe this time i will get luck,0
broken bottle ordered this set for my grandma it showed up NUMBER days before christmas and the main perfume bottle was cracked and had leaked every where wouldnt recommend buying from the seller should have just went to jcpenny in the first place,0
chiefs i got a vhscopy that did not work on my video player i was able to return to the sender i would have liked to get the new dvd copy but found it too costly it was a good tv series and book and isaw it quite a long time ago it to bad that the cost is high ron,0
vague advice i bought this book just before marrying a man with four children from his first marriage i expected solid examples of stepmoms overcoming obstacles and sharing their wisdom however i found the book very frustrating NUMBER the testimonials all came from women who were dissatisfied with their relationships neglecting those who developed strong bonds with stepchildren NUMBER the advice is all too vague to be applied chapters titled simplify expectations and simplify relationships are filled with generalizations that are about as effective as telling an over stressed mom to just relax overall a disappointing read,0
a connecticut yankee in king arthur court i thought that a connecticut yankee in king arthur court by mark twain touched a lot of important aspects that our culture and society faces today while also satirized the times of camelot it also contrasted and showed the differences between the medieval times and the nineteenth century but unfortunately i found this book hard to follow and had trouble getting into it i felt that twain often drug on certain topics or ideas i think that i would have found this book to be a lot more interesting if twain would have been more forward and to the point i guess this book just was not for me but others might find it interesting but i do have a lot of respect for twain for writing this i am sure that this book caused a lot of controversy since he wrote about a lot of sensitive topics especially earlier in his time,0
a great satire in the form of a great work of literature mark twain is no science fiction author but he makes this a good story anyway he sends a mechanical genius back to the time of king arthur to take a look back at america because of his knowledge the narrarator becomes the king right hand man the second most powerful man in england known as the boss he begins to establish a more advanced society underground to gaurd against the church over many years he learns to adjust to the society and becomes respected world wide due to his magic unforetunately this results in making merlin his great advisary the boss goes on many adventures and gets involved in many predicaments each time surviving by his wit and knowledge a wonderfully told tale that examines america faults by looking at them from NUMBER centuries before unfortunately twain once again falls short on his ending and leaves the reader mildly entertained but not better off,1
i did not really like the book it was boring the end best it was grat at some parts and boring at others the end made up for alot of the book,0
very different book i think that this book was very diffent and that it was very hard to understand most of the book i wasnt really sure what was going on just that he was magical and that he was in the past there was definitly a twisted ending but thats ok if i had a choice i probably wouldnt have read this book and read a different book on the list but oh well i got the pages i needed out of it,0

a clear differentiation of the three codes among the many works of tibetan masters devoted to the three codes none has enjoyed more notoriety than a clear differentiation of the three codes by the celebrated author saskya pandita kunga gyaltshen or sapan NUMBER presented here in a western translation for the first time not so much a text on the content of the codes themselves as an examination of the many particular questions that relate to the codes questions that sapan saw as subject to misunderstanding on the part of his tibetan contemporaries the three codes has a strongly polemical character thus it is easy to see why some readers found the work objectionable in places others praised it and all have become fascinated by it few indigenous tibetan writings have inspired so abundant and diverse a body of later commentary commentary that rivals even that on the great indian buddhust treatises in its extent,1
what a disappointment my son two favorite things in the world NUMBER little einsteins NUMBER space he went crazy when he saw the commercial for this new dvd we too pre ordered the movie and counted down the days until its release and we too were bitterly disappointed by its contents as the other reviewers have said it is not a movie and it is not about space i would think that if disney were going to release a space themed dvd containing old episodes they would at least include galactic goodnight at least that one actually talked about the planets i would not have purchased this if i would have been able to preview it before buying,0
need something to light a fire here you go i gave this one star because negative stars are not allowed the previous review has to have been written by someone closely related to the book i was a teen ager during the NUMBER s ninja craze and even then this book would have been seen as a complete joke i think i was expecting a mutant ninja turtles cartoon to turn up somewhere in the book but was disappointed to not see one bottom line stay away from this book if you are really interested in something about ninja look into stephen k hayes,0
a item came on time in excellent condition great service hope i can do business with this seller again highly recommended,1
as expected i got this for my child and he loves it order flowed as expected easy as pie comics are still a great gift,1
this guy was evil this book shows you that bob was a womanizer but bob was way worse than what this book says check out another book about bob hope called thanks for the memories by brice taylor yep bob and michael jackson had something in common only bob had underaged girls not boys,1
good for the tackle box i got this as a gift for my NUMBER year old nephew who loves to go fishing he needed some help getting the hooks out of the fish and this works great with his little hands it fits nicely in his tackle box and the wood grain makes it look really nice i am sure he will out grow it or end up dropping it in the lake but for the price i can afford to buy him another one later,1
thank you this one gift i could give my grown daughter i read this book over and over to her as a child it was in wonderful condition,0
one star and it goes to jlh and the stiller the characters with the smallest amount of screen time played by jennifer love hewitt ben stiller and his real life dad jerry stiller are the only ones worth watching for in this sad little effort the story is a mishmash and not at all interesting but hey ms hewitt does look great so if you are into that i can recommend it one thing i do want to point out however is that there is no commentary track on the dvd contrary to what the specs show,0
somebody shoot me please jennifer love hewitt is the only bright spot in this mind dulling dribble the script leaves you not caring for the characters i can not say the words to descibe this movie there is maybe one or two semi funny scenes in the whole NUMBER min of boredom if you like daydreaming buy this dvd because you will be so bored your mind will be wandering in thousands of directions,0
worst book from whitman ever the black and white photo look like photocopies of photocopies and to add insult to everyone the book is printed in china whitman has sunk to a new low on this one buy any other book other than this one if you really want to use it the poorest book that whitman has ever offered lets hope it not theirstandard for the future,0
my nephew loved this i gave it all NUMBER stars just because my nephew loved it so much he is very hard to please at NUMBER yrs old and this was something he really enjoyed he likes hands on things and race cars so there you go,1
this is a great product i bought this having read some bad reviews about it but you get what you pay for but i was actually blown away by it the picture quality is wonderful the sound is good unless it noisy though what i did was used some mini speakers you can buy for discmans they work great to add extra volume the battery does last about three hours but it does come with an a c adapter and car adapter which is nice i also liked the fact that it came with a cord do not know what it called but i was able to plug it into my home theater system for surround sound and also into my tv for larger picture i also rent a lot of dvd and all of the rentals worked fine for me if your having trouble with a disc just clean it i use soap and water although i hear that a big no no but it works great overall it is a awesome system for the money,1
it stings picture is very bad sound not that good eather lacks lots of inportent features havey and bulkey almost like a notebook feels vary clumsey in your hand whorse of all whit slith tuceh dics door will open while playing,0
terrible nickel allergy triggered by strap connectors adjusters the strap loops and strap adjusters triggered a severe nickel allergy on my back where they touch the skin there should be a warning on the tag but there is not if you have a nickel allergy do not buy this in most bras these connectors and adjusters are covered with or use plastic this is bare metal and contains enough nickel for an almost instant breakout,0
product is cheaply made customer service was terrible from elmosworld i purchased NUMBER of these items on one of them the lcd display does not work perfectly the NUMBER as a part of NUMBER NUMBER pm is missing a line of the NUMBER on the display see my submitted pictures but this is no big deal the item still works ok the other product arrived damaged since it has a battery compartment door that is made of cheap plastic at the bottom of the unit and ups damaged it during shipping it took me filing a complaint with amazon just to get a response from this company and the situation is still not resolved they have not offered to send me a free return label to send it back to them i will never order from elmosworld again terrible customer service,0
genuine chinese crap this radio is insanely over priced you can get worse but you can not pay more for it the oregon scientific wr NUMBER is a true piece of crap do not purchase it i bought mine brand new in the box for two dollars at a church yard sale boy am i glad i did not pay more for it the oregon scientific wr NUMBER is cheaply constructed all the way around everything about this shoddy radio is cheap cheap cheap want poor reception you got it want brittle plastic that breaks easily you got it want a compass that does not work you got that too be prepared to do quite a bit of research to find an emergency radio worth owning if it says made in china avoid it if you can if china does make anything worth owning they certainly do not export it to the usa oregon scientific is another term for cheap piece of chinese crap you will regret it if you buy this radio caveat emptor,0
i agree i agree with the review from august NUMBER NUMBER in that mary anne needs to move on and it wouldbe cool to have her do something else however i did really enjoy the book i thought when mary anne helped sunny it showed more of her personality from the old series and i liked that mary anne more i thought it was funny how active sunny was,1
lousy phone good price with a nice package but very poor quality sound we purchased NUMBER of these phones both had echo and low sound quality we could not even have a conversation with the other party both are being returned,0
great cd this cd contains nearly all of peter gabriel through the album so in NUMBER go through the track list and you will likely find more than a few you have heard on the radio a glaring ommission is gabriels most famous and possibly best song in your eyes although you will find that at least a quarter of the sixteen tracks on this cd come from so that song is missing from this collection for that reason i knock a point off this best of collection,1
just what i wanted i was looking for a good walking sandal that could be adjusted in case my feet were swollen as often happens after flying these were comfortable right away the size was good wore them every day and they were always comfortable no blisters forming very happy with them and would purchase other propet products,1
poor quality item is very heavy and does not hold a charge well illumination begns to dim almost immediately and is never very bright i would not purchase this item again,0
poor light looses charge fast i have been purchasing a few of these self charging flashlights lately to find the best one this one puts out a a poor amount of light it also does not retain its charge well you will have to shake it frequently to keep it charged i would say it is one of the worst ones i purchased,0
flashlight do not ever buy this it is a rip off and a gimmick your hands will get tired really fast for shaking the flashlight and NUMBER seconds of shaking will not even get you NUMBER minutes of light with consistent brightness even more the light dims almost instantly after shaking with no retention of charge whatsoever other flashlights that require cranking can give up to NUMBER hours of light for NUMBER minute of cranking if you get the right one,0
reed switch does not work the flashlight is inoperable i am helping my son with an electromagnetic induction science fair project and have studied extensively the requirements for these types of flashlights to operate this flashlight is better than the shake flashlight we previously ordered for NUMBER NUMBER at amazon com because it actually uses a real nib magnet and appropriate circuitry however the reed switch which uses a small magnet to connect the capacitor stored potential to the led does not work thus the led will not light i am very disappointed with this purchase there are genuienly amazing shake flashlights that both in function and design are truly brilliant devices but they cost a lot more than this flashlight so it seems that the old saying you get what you pay for is proven true once again,0
not louie anderson finest hour i remember going to see this at the theater in NUMBER when i was fourteen besides my dad and me there were only two other people in the theater they stood up and left halfway through there was a good reason for this this movie is very poor and i believe it only stayed in theaters for about a week before tanking good for nostalgia value only,0
not recommended i am very disappointed with this phone i have to press the talk button several times to get a dial tone and then when i do get a dial tone and make a call i have a very hard time hearing the person on the other end of the line the caller id feature does not work and i know it is not my phone company because our other cid displays work fine it always just flashes ringing on the display when the phone rings i have owned this phone for NUMBER months now and i am planning to replace it very soon,0
better than expected i do not really expect a lot from voyager novels fact is i rarely buy them unless they are part of a series like this one so i found myself pleasantly surprised by this one carey does not rely as much on the bar to jar the reader in and out of the story and it stronger for that she gives janeway her own unique voice and makes reading the book a pure pleasure my only gripe is that carey love of sailing shows through far too many times and is getting a bit tedious since it been the focus of her past several trek yarns but otherwise an enjoyably pleasant book,1
let us replace plot and acting with profuse profanity and see if they can tell the difference this movie is just plain bad do not get me wrong i wanted to like it having come off watching american zombie which also sucked i was hoping for some needed zombie respite not happening here what dialogue and acting there is seems forced and badly delivered frankly most lines and acting seemed like they belonged in a bad porno rather than a good zombie movie neither of which is this movie it seems like whenever there was a lack of dialogue for a scene it was simply replaced with profanity of all sorts i ended up turning this movie off half way through it which i very rarely do i felt the movie bored me offered nothing and basically wasted my time and money if you want a good zombie movie i do not think this is it seedawn of the dead zombieland fido shaun of the dead resident evil dead snow pretty much anything other than this movie,0
original thought this movie had an original idea but lact so much for being a zombie movie at times it was just stupid another zombie movie id pass on doubt i will be re watching this movie any time soon,0
low quality packing tape i pack and ship items on a daily basis i bought this tape to seal my packages it was cheap so yay for price but extremely low quality it will not adequately seal a cardboard mailer without many layers even then i worry that the package will open in transit lesson learned next time i will pay more for a higher quality product,0

there nothing better than live rolling stones i own three rolling stones albums now but there nothing like listening to them live on cd there are two new studio tracks on the cd at first i thought they had covered sex drive by twisted sister and w a s p but a closer listen brung up different lyrics,1
stones live with a full band many people prefer the stones as just the NUMBER playing live but i also like when they brought on this large troupe along for the shows more backup singes brass section and NUMBER keyboards the stones are much more controlled and played very well and together what you do not get is the raw energy of a rock concert as you would find on their NUMBER still life album but i find this album most enjoyable my only gripe is they left off gim me shelter which they did an incredible job at and threw in NUMBER lousy studio redcordings to get a hit single out of for bigger sales high wire is a good song the NUMBER nd studio song sex drive is a joke and should have stayed in the vaults complete waste to add that trash song to this magnificient live stones album you can get the accompanying dvd live at the max and se it for yourself,1
awsome i do not know what the lower guys issues with his connection are i have NUMBER issues with ping mine is always in the NUMBER range maybe you should stop dling porn while playing multiplayer games this is a great game very fast paced and enjoyable you can choose to enter any type of vehicle while being more arcade than simulation the action and craziness are well worth the low price offered by ea games,1
great selection of songs mate disapointed that tie me kangaroo down sport was only instrumental other wise very happy,1

excellent service i received my shipment of this blu ray disc in excellent condition and in record delivery time thanks,1
review by a music lover if you love rock and roll music and you appreciate it history you will love this movie great sound great music great performances and solid acting this movie confirms in my mind who the ultimate father of rock and roll really is and how the rolling stones came up with the name for their band very interesting,1
changing from a NUMBER th century status and power driven environment to a NUMBER st continuous learning and collaborative environment after image is much more than a marketing and branding education grant communicates very powerfully the change in structure and thinking that is necessary for individuals and for us as whole to succeed in the NUMBER st century his explaination of moving from a work status ethic to a continuous learning collaborative networking ethic provides a structure for individuals organizations and countries to base their readiness for the real work of the NUMBER st century,1
oh yeah the coriolanus effect this one is not really science fiction since with only changes it could be set in the here and now or in ruritania but it pure heinlein and better written than many of his earlier works at only NUMBER pages it also pretty short for a novel but it works lorenzo smyth a k a larry smith is an actor convinced of his own talent which as it turns out is actually considerable who is hired to impersonate the good guy leader of a major political alliance who has been kidnaped on mars by the evil opposition against his better apolitical judgment lorenzo takes the job because it a challenge and almost immediately regrets it as the limited engagement spins itself out indefinitely there a minimum of strident overwriting of the sort heinlein was often guilty of in pursuit of his moral and ethical positions with the quietly made exception of a plea for racial tolerance,1

how could you do this aaagggghhhhhhh that the sound of millions of anne of green gables fans screaming in collective disgust not only is this last anne movie bad it horrifyingly bad i am a strongly against capital punishment but this movie has given me pause i can not believe the canadian government did not put the movies producer in front of a firing squad for the way he thoroughly trashed the wonderful stories of anne gilbert and the gang not to mention trashing the hopes of millions of anne fans how a movie producer could miss so badly after hitting two grand slams is totally beyond my comprehension why did he depart from the books and make up a totally different story the first two anne of green gables movies were beautifully done this one gives censorship a good name,0
the worst movie ever my family and i love anne of green gables and cried through most of it we do not have a problem with the first NUMBER but we have been watching the series NUMBER NUMBER each week and come to the last dvd the coninuing story and boy is is the worst acted and story movie we have ever seen i do not know what happen to anne megan fellows she was dead in every which way you look at it no sparkal no love no joy or happeness in her eyes or face at any time she acted like a NUMBER year old women we know she grew up but a person who has sparkle and joy and laughter in their eyes never loses that and her voice in a few years has become deep and old we are so disappointed and so upset with this dvd how can ones acting and joy be gone so fast help,0
a stain on lucy maude montgomery this final installment of an otherwise brilliant trilogy on the anne of green gables story is beyond horrific it is a stain on the memory of lucy maude montgomery,0
unimaginably bad i bought this despite the bad reviews because i thought it was impossible for an anne movie to be that bad but they managed to pull it off not only do they burn down green gables but they create chemistry between anne and another man while things with anne and gil are cold come on people all we want is a good chick flick with a nice ending,0
disappointing i absolutely loved the first two anne movies when i heard they were finally making another movie i was very excited to see it i was extremely disappointed that the movie thoroughly strayed from l m montgomery enchanting story line the story line was nothing like the true story of anne and although some may think it is a good movie in its own way it is not worthy to carry the name anne of green gables the plot of this movie held no interest for me and was extremely disappointing,0
disappointing this is the third installment in a series of dramatizations of lucy maud montgomery beloved anne of green gables novels megan follows and jonathon crombie return in their usual roles unfortunately this third production does not meet the high standards set by the first faithful installment in a total of seven anne novels montgomery provided fully enough amusing sentimental and unabashedly romantic material for three movies it was a pity that the second production anne of green gables the sequel departed somewhat from the novels it a crime that this third production leaves montgomery behind entirely transporting her characters forward in time pitchforking them into a trite war plot and resolving the incoherent plot elements with a tepid candy coated ending,0
dissapointed to say the least i remember watching the anne of green gables and anne of avonlea movies as a child from start to finish and then immediately rewinding them to start again this movie is an intirely different story not only was it a far cry from the book version i found it to be incredibly insulting the anti american sediment found throughout the movie is something that i took to heart and i belive that kevin sullivan did a wonderful job at alienating much of his audience by the thoughtless comments made in this film i have about as much respect for him now as he has for half of the people who have supported him by buying his movies i will never buy another one of his films and unfortunatly this is a movie that i will never share with my own children,0
not the same as anne NUMBER NUMBER this was a major disappointment i loved the first and second of the anne series but this one does not have the same feel or charm that made anne NUMBER and NUMBER so loved its like its not kevin sullivan making this its far to artsy and revolves around the war rather than the characters and green gables they hardly even show green gables and it even gets burned down how could they do that i wish i never watched this as its ruined the way i imagined anne and the others to have lived happily ever after is what i expected,0
soooooo disappointed i was so happy when i borrowed this movie from our local library now i am only happy that i borrowed it instead of purchasing it the books were basically thrown out when this movie was made i was so disappointed i will not watch this sequel again if you really liked the first two movies i would not bother to watch the NUMBER rd it left me feeling sick to my stomach at such a gross departure from the books and story line,0
do not do it the first two are wonderful but do not waste your time or money on the continuing story it is awful is not even similar to the books and she does very un anne like things not worth it at all and very disappointing,0
has nothing in common with the books there is nothing and i mean truly nothing in common between the anne books and this movie it quite horrible in every way i wish i could give it negative stars yes the second mini series of this trilogy takes frequent license but it retains enough episodes and character of the book to be quite enjoyable in it own way this little thing simply keeps a few character names retains several original actors and truly and completely makes up a story out of whole cloth if they were in such an itch to make a wwi anne they could and should have made but they made this atrocity instead if you have any respect for the book please just forget this movie exists hideous,0
big problems with amazon quality control the dvd did not match the title of the cover literally the wrong movie was in the anne of green gables the continuing story sleeve pretty much of a let down come on amazon get on your suppliers joe,0
great movie great service my daughter and i love this movie we have been watching it since she was a child she is now in her NUMBER and we still watch it together,1
darcy on it own the movie is a very decent sort however it quite disgusting the liberties kevin sullivan took with the storyline while pretending it was a continuation of the anne of green gables story i was very disappointed,0
i am very disappoinsted this film lost simple life of characters and sense of humor of basis of anne series,0
not as good i did not like the continuing story as much as green gables and avonlea i guess anne and gilbert was all grown up in the continuing story did not really like the war atmosphere felt so sad,0
still a riot more hilarious after reading bitter with baggage i did not think there could be a more spot on hilarious take of a chick life that is until i picked up going for the bronze tanen captures a women life and relationships and the angst and humor that goes along with both brilliantly this is the perfect book to share with a friend having a bad day i have turned many a friend tears of frustration into tears of laughter with a mere flip of the page it also the ideal book to share with each other to make a good day even better if these crazy little chicks could talk they make great guests on oprah wait if they could talk they have their own show and oprah would be their guest,1
not what i had expected this course while extensive in activities was not what i had expected the course did not start out basic such as learning basic communication between two people i think this course is better for someone who is some what fluent in french already in addition this course is however good for refreshment or learning more where it comes to things such as ordering dinner or renting an apartment,0
drive in second feature are you really going out with him uh huh by the way where did you meet him i met him at the candy store and then we went out in his convertable and played chicken with a cop cool did you win uh huh and the cop he did not win oh by the way what his name oh silly do not you know all hot rod juvenile delinquents from cheap late NUMBER s early NUMBER s movies are named johney johney angel johney devil johney do not care about nothin johney says the only good cop is a dead cop cool tonight we are robbing a case of beer and hanging out at the beach where we will get drunk and neck and say real out of date things teenagers used to say that real boss and then we will run a cop off the road and speed away in a wild climactic car chase cool can i come if you do not mind getting killed in a wild climactic car chase uh maybe i will just stay home cool uh huh,0
very good is it just me or does anybody else notice that the production standards on this disc are not up to those of his other recordings play this album back to back with so and you will notice that the sound on so is much crisper and cleaner anyway the musical content on this album is right up there with so and in some instances surpasses it oh sure there are the obligatory i am only putting this tune on the disc in hopes that i will get radio airplay songs steam and kiss that frog in which he tries to repeat the success of sledgehammer otherwise the songs on us are some of the best that pg ever done either lyrically or musically even the early nineties hit digging in the dirt is a pretty complex look into the psyche if you like so you will be pleasantly surprised by us and btw if you like us check out plus from us which is a compilation of music from the musicians which appeared on and inspired the music of us,1
spend a little more and get a better router i have owned and have friends that own different routers then this one and none are as bad two major problems with this router NUMBER wireless range is bad i own a cheap router and it has twice the range NUMBER router loves to disconnect from the internet when multiple pc are accessing the internet at once i have the latest firmware which states it addresses the disconnect problem but does not hopefully they will come out with a new version soon,0
easy setup poor range i bought this unit after my linksys wireless router died i can therefore only compare it to the linksys setup was extremely quick and easy i got it up and running in just a few minutes the ui of the admin app is very straight forward and i notice is strangely similar to the ui of smc routers i find it to be somewhat easier to work with than the linksys ui i am unfortunately not pleased with the transmission range of this router i placed it in the exact same location that the linksys had been in a computer that was getting solid NUMBER connection strength with the linksys is now only getting NUMBER with this unit another machine that was getting around NUMBER on the linksys would not connect at all to this unit until it was moved to a different location this would be an excellent unit were it not for the range problem perhaps there a fix,0
do not buy this from the first day i bought this product it had problems i called my service provider and we established that my connection is fine its definitely the router i called belkin tech support and they tried to sell me service support in order to fix my problem i managed to fix the problem for a few weeks but it returned the thing keeps losing connection and i have to unplug and replug the darn thing to get it going again its a pain i wish i had spent a few dollars more and got a decent router,0
repeatedly hangs this router has good functionality and ease of use but reliability is more important for me and this router hangs about once a day so i am giving it NUMBER star you need to unplug the power cord and plug it back in every time to get it to work again the range is a bit disappointing too about NUMBER ft indoors on the plus side NUMBER bit wep and ability to limit access by mac address are nice and it very easy to set up reading around some forums makes me think that the hanging problem is not universal so if you are lucky enough to get one that works it not a bad router if you do not need long range wireless for me i am returning it for a refund,0
good solid cordless phone i was very surprised to see ony two stars for this phone i have had one for over two years and this phone has been a good solid performer i am a self proclaimed gadget freak and have tried many different cordless phone brands i think that panasonic and sony make the best phone and i think that panasonic while the cheaper of the two generally makes better equipment with two small kids ours has been dropped and moved multiple times and has never given us trouble it has provided better clarity than my more expensive sony phones as well i will admit that the features that are jammed into this phone are a bit over the top but this is a very useful phone in fact i am on the site to purchase one for my mom happy holiday,1
ditto to horrible battery life my first panasonic NUMBER works great this NUMBER will not hold a charge for more than NUMBER minutes talk time and it only two weeks old customer service offered to replace it with a refurbished model when all i am looking for is a new battery i paid top dollar so that i could trade it in two weeks later for a refurbished unit i am very dissapointed with them never another panasonic,0
lousy support after the sale we lost the handset called panasonic to get a replacement they would not sell us a replacement handset overall disappointed with panasonic and this phone,0
disappointed consumer i had a uniden phone for over NUMBER years which i loved unfortunately lighting hit and blew out all my phone lines and phones i spent a lot of time trying to find the right phone and thought i had i bought this phone about NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER years ago not only does the battery go dead quickly but i have already had to replace the battery then my keypad started to wear out i do not use the phone and or keypad excessively i was sure it was a defect so i called panasonic the options they gave me were completely unacceptable i am now shopping for a new phone and it certainly will not be a panasonic no matter what the reviews or features are,0
panasonic NUMBER w not very happy with the clarity of this phone also very uncomfortable the way it rests on my ear and it also feels like i am talking into an echo taking it back to staples tomorrow overpriced unsure of what else to buy just glad to dispose of it,0
amazing set of cookware its been a very long time since i reviewed anything but this set deserves my time to review though i bought this set elsewhere i bought other pieces from amazon with the NUMBER for NUMBER offer to complete the set i cook twice everyday and i have to say i have loved cooking with these pots the NUMBER qt stockpot that comes with the set is what i use very sparingly given its size making it slightly unuseable for my small family of NUMBER otherwise i got the NUMBER NUMBER qt casserole NUMBER qt NUMBER qt saucepans i also got a NUMBER qt stockpot and pretty much those cover all my cooking needs very heavy and will certainly last a lifetime i have not cooked with all clad yet so i can not comment if this set is comparable but all clad is definitely in my list,1
yes another live album but this is diferent there are interesting facts about the released of stripped basically it is an unpugged album from the stones it was the very first interactive cd when i first bought this cd it was the very first interactive multimedia record ever done booklet came with instructions intercative material etc also appears the very first rolling stones site by NUMBER whe the internet was so new the site shows only merchandise in just a few pages all those years ago it is very interesting looking and hearing hidden tracks also during the voodoo lounge tour the stones perform some surprise gigs in some cities in the time of the unplugged records this is a testimony of great tracks recorded in a different way we used to hear the stones it is a great album quite diferent and of course like a rolling stones a classic made a classic,1
is good yet another live stones album but it good like most live albums from these guys you get a combination of spendidly done covers by the world most underrated cover band and stones standards my favorites are the grinding rendition of street fighting man the fresh delivery of shine a light and the must have pairing of iconic band with iconic title on like a rolling stone if you are looking at this with any consideration at all go ahead you can not lose this also comes with the reassurance that even though this band really has not given us much new worth listening to in about NUMBER years at least they have not lost their ability to put it out on stage at least as of the mid NUMBER when this was done,1
unbelievable i will echo exactly what the previous NUMBER reviewers wrote this film is amazing unbelievable almost beyond words here is a church probably minutes away from our white house and our congress these who are supposed to be taking care of their neighborhood which would be the whole united states anyway the church is filled with people who support each other and improve their neighborhood with knowledge job training peaceful demonstrations free healthcare and much more the church seems to me to be exactly what a church is meant to be,1
our gritty female ancestors were amazing i started reading this little gem while researching material for an historical fiction novel and soon discovered that i could not get enough of their stories before reading this book i was guilty of looking back at our history never imagining the grit and humor our ancestors possessed a great read,1
possibly gabriel best solo work i was surprised to see some relatively negative comments directed towards pg second solo album i recently re visited this album after many years and found that while some of the more popular albums NUMBER and security have not aged particularly well this one stands the test of time i would rate this as pg best solo album or at least my favorite not as pretentious as the albums that followed it but darkly moving,1
fantastic sacd this was never advertised as a multi channel sacd and i am glad that they did not try to reformat it the definitive edition of peter gabriel work is all on sacd now and are must haves for any fan with an sacd player what many people do not realize about sacd is that the sampling rate is NUMBER NUMBER million samples per second as opposed to a normal cd which is only NUMBER NUMBER thousand sps it is as close to an analog stream that you can get highly recommended if you do not have a good ear for audio and a good stereo system to listen to high definition audio on then obviously you will not hear the difference but for audiophiles a dream come true,1

a keeper signature killers was informative educational and kept me focussed and intrieged by the minds of criminals by using different case studies robert keppel brings into review some of the most disturbing crimes and analyzes the root and causes of these human diviances a definate keeper in my books,1
truth or hype mr keppel i found that in at least one case mentioned in this book information given to readers was not necessarily true was this book written after researching past newspaper articles or was it really from experience i now realize how john q public is lead by the nose into believing whatever hype will sell once again the public is lead on a lynching without the complete truth available look out for the boogyman he still makes money for some people i am disappointed in the book knowing that if one case was based on public hype how can i believe anything else in the book,0
save your money unless you like pain all i did was walk down a hallway twice in my house and both little toes feel as if they were cut up by razor blades they look comfy but the front strap is stiff and just cuts right into your toes beware,0

cheap made product after getting tired of looking for batteries for our other sharpeners i decided to look for a sharpener closer to what i used in school well this one is not it after three uses the entire collection cup just came off and would not go back on after adjusting every way imaginable in order to sharpen a pencil the cup must be on securely and ours was just flat out broken also the pad on the bottom of the unit was very loose upon opening but we were still able to make it suction to our granite do not waste your money on this cheap plastic,0
broke after a few months i got this for my kids to use at home and for a few months it was a good little sharpener suction works well not messy to dump out the shavings etc however the teeth on the wheels grinded too much and stopped making the sharpening piece inside to turn,0

a brilliant catalog of psychological disorders what do an amnesiac an assassin a chronic compulsive and an institutionalized lunatic have in common they all enjoy residence on this incredible album by peter gabriel the amazing lyrical territory is matched by unprecedented sonics which married dry guitars erratic keyboards with heavily gated drums which would later become phil collins trademark sound one of the greatest albums of the decade,1
another cheryl cullen disappointment this is one of the worst brochure design books i have ever seen outdated design and most of them from the united states more like a marketing tool for cheryl dangel cullen designer friends most of the designs do not even show the brochure covers another huge disappointment from cheryl dangel cullen same with global graphics colour and global graphics symbols both of which are showcases of wrong information i wouldnt even give one star but that is the bottom of the barrel,0

still great still life captures the sounds from the band tattoo you tour which was their first extensive tour of the us in several years the band sounds tight and revitalized it is interesting to hear them play start me up as it is was a new song at the time and they had not yet played it a million times shattered and just my imagination are roaring and their version of the miracles going to a go go is a crowd pleaser under my thumb is another very strong cut and it has a unusual but perfectly fitting intro with duke ellington take the train still life shows the band at the peak of their concert playing where the songs still sound fresh and have not become old warhorses,1

computer gamer this is a good quality game and it played a lot in our household we play one person mahjong very often here maybe too often and everyone from the adults to the NUMBER year old is hooked on this particular game there a two person version as well but it not as big of hit in our household the graphics on the tiles are detailed so this may not be a game for laptop size screens but works just fine on regular larger monitors you have also got the option to choose different tile graphics and layouts which might help one reason we purchased it is so that it could be played both on the mac and the ms pc and it does that well it has some fun sounds as the tiles are matched and removed if you have the cd in you get the sounds without the cd no cute sounds but the game goes faster so it depends on what you want i like the quality the flexibility and the challenge of the mahjong game offered in this cd,1

read the books skip the movie i love louis especially his epic series the sacketts the stories are believable tautly written and accessible for just about anyone unfortunately the same can not not be said about this movie which is based upon two of the stories the daybreakers and sackett with great anticipation i watched this movie i wanted to enjoy it but no matter how hard i tried i cound not for one simple reason the acting is atrocious tom selleck is awful mercedes mccambridge is awful really awful and sadly worst of all is glenn ford the best acting comes from the veterans ben johnson and sam elliot barely what frustrates me is that these are talented actors what kind of direction were they receiving from robert totten one take and next scene must have been his credo really disappointing do not waste your money read the books instead,0

check out before you buy the product looks ok the buttons are nice and big and easy to read they do not work very well though for example when pushing on the speaker button to dial or answer the phone often i have to press it several times and just right for it to work it does not come with the ac adapter and northwestern bell no longer makes or distributes them without the adapter the lights do not work including the message waiting light it is not what it was reported to be and does not function the way it is supposed to because it does not have an adapter i have tried several stores such as radio shack best buy walmart and target to find an adapter NUMBER vac to NUMBER v NUMBER ma and can not find one i have not been able to find one online either also the product information indicates this phone takes NUMBER aa batteries it does not this one takes NUMBER aaa batteries not that the size of the batteries makes any difference to me but the description is not accurate for the item i am sending it back,0
no no no do not buy this book he makes incredible errors of historical fact well known historical fact at that for heaven sakes never mind his errors regarding the women lives he puts warm springs where fdr died in west virgina instead of georgia and where were his editors his lack of understanding of the truth of women lives is no worse than many otherwise credible male biographers read it with a spoonful of salt and you will learn of many women who have been overlooked just know going in that you are reading what amounts to a shallow overview magazine type article not unenjoyable just disappointing i ignored the whole rating thing which is absurd,0
get with the times for those who do not want to be dragged into the new net world there is still asp however NUMBER NUMBER is the old version at least get NUMBER NUMBER,0
worthless as a beginner i found this book worthless many of the scripts in the book and on the cd apparently do not work i asked a friend who is a bright engineering student with programming experience to try to try her hand at getting the guest book script to work and she did not have any luck either i submitted a question twice to the online q a forum over NUMBER weeks ago and it has yet to be posted nor have i received any acknowledgement that the message was received in my opinion this book fails on all counts i advise beginners to look elsewhere,0
the best wisdom poetry of our age the dead can tell us being dead what no living personcan tell us wrote t s eliot what masters has done for us when he was alive is write a collection of whispered epitaphs voices silently crying out from the graves the ironies sadnesses wastes agonies and miscalculations of their spent lives this is not poetry to turn a phrase necessarily nor is it poetry to enchant instead it is wisdom poetry poetry that carries the weight of mistakes of the twisted lives creating their own kind of hell hobbes hell is truth too late learned written in NUMBER and written as if for choral voices would not this be a great piece for a dramatic interpretation in which several voices perform each poem collected it becomes overwhelming just as a visit to a cemetary to mourn the losses of one of your loves can also be overwhelming no it is not sad though somehow hope still survives like the shoot stabbing through the cracked granite toward the sun,1
could have used more guitar but still good the latest offering from unit NUMBER is a little more geared towards total electronics than eletronics mixed with heavy guitars but that does not make this a bad album most of the songs come off as instrumentals with tod law shouting one or two lines here and there the electronics still have the trademark unit NUMBER sound very abrasive and harsh i would have maybe liked to have seen more lyrics or guitars in these songs but they are still good my favorite is by far the title track which opens the record both mixes of anger management are also good if you have the other releases from the boys pick this one up as well it worth it in my opinion,1
love this cookbook great old fashioned recipes great cook book a lot of great tried and true recipes like the standard chocolate chip cookie and peanut butter cookie love how they spell it though a few of the recipes are a bit outdated like prune cookies but most of them have stood the test of time great fun to flip through easy to read font old fashion little illustrations here and there and a lot of full colored pictures of the cookies i have to say some of the cookies are not pretty but they taste great a true original and practical for children to use do to the ease of the ingredients and font style oh and almost all of the recipes call for shortening so substituting butter is a must great for collectors bought this to replace my mom original copy from the NUMBER,1
remember from my childhood i love this book not just because i used to love making cookies with my mom years ago but the variety of cookies make this book one of the best highly recommended,1
christmas all year this is a treasure trove of wonderful cookie recipes pecan crispies are light and elegant thumbprint russian teacake meringues and sugar cookies are holiday favorites shamrock cookies become witches fingers for halloween with just omission of food coloring and a different rolling technique almond butter french lace nut crunch cookies of course there are hundreds more your favorites no doubt i recommend buying this book if you bake or if you hope to but i will add it not the original betty crocker cookie book my mother has that from the NUMBER or NUMBER i think smaller and with fewer recipes but awesome this version has vivid color photographs so you can drool or occupy your kids with just visuals while you consider what to make next,1
betty crocker cooky book fast shipment easy to find what i wanted it was a gift for my daughter just what i ordered used but in very good condition my daughter was very happy,1
a family treasure my girlfriend used this cooky book when her two daughters were growing up they both treasure it even though it is falling apart from so much use when i discovered that it had been reprinted i just had to purchase one for each of my friend daughters they were thrilled to each have their own copy what a family treasure,1
good stuff when i listened to it it made me miss dream street even more i wish they had still stayed together and then the cd would have been all dream street songs but regardless it a good cd the new stuff is really good but it was kind of weird putting you are taking me over next to with all my heart because their voices were still high in ytmo but had dropped by wamh i also enjoyed hearing some of the redone old songs if you like dream street go out and buy this cd why are you still reading this i said go out and buy it,1
ds rulez ok this is dream street what more can i say they are great and have amazing voices this cd is awesome and the movie is too the songs are catchy and u can tell there is a major voice change compared to their first cd also the song with all my heart gets to me every time i listen to it its such a great song one of their best ok so anyways all i am saying even though its been forever since the cd came out and since the dream street brake up that does not mean that you still can not support them so hurry up and get the cd cuz there really isnt that many copies left well the last time i checked there was not ok thats all i got to say,1
they sounded better in their debut as you grow up your voices mature they are suppose to get better this did not work for dream street unfortunately their debut is so much better even though jesse was what NUMBER and sounding as aaron carter did when he was NUMBER i think it highly unnecessary for a soundtrack just because they are in the movie to have NUMBER of the songs theirs the only songs i really liked on this is i say yeah which is again way better w the original version and i am going to make you love me even though i dislike play i thought the song was pretty cute and chris added a nice to it,0
dolph lundgren rocks i love this film dolph in his best film role this is the movie that made me a fan of his lee is awsome too the best ninja type film i have ever saw,1

the funniest movie about the NUMBER s ever and it comes from france set around a funeral a family gathered perhaps for the very last time in grief and in the midst of a near revolution the may fools manages to cover the entire history of the NUMBER s through hope euphoria and paranoia back to a cynical sad reality still one of the funniest movies ever made i am fortunate to have an old video tape of it i am writing this in the hope that someday it will be released on dvd for american audiences,1
excelente como todos los libros de l es una lectura muy amena para el que sabe un poco del idioma astrol gico sin embargo es f cil de leer y el libro a diferencia de otros de sa est escrito de una forma m s informal debido a que es tipo conferencias de pregunta y respuesta es un excelente complemento para el otro libro del mismo autor person to person astrology,1
i am sure it useful if you could read the print this concordance has the smallest print i have ever seen in any book even with my reading glasses i have to squint in order to make out the print i even tried a magnifying glass but gave up i do not know who would able to use this book i wasted my money since i can not even read it,0
not complete does not offer the original word next to the translation i am very disappointed to see what this book ended up being i was expecting a compact version of my strong concordance but they changed it to the point of worthlessness it is worth lugging the big book around in order to see the truth for example you will never know from this book that yhwh hebrew NUMBER is used nearly NUMBER NUMBER times in the hebrew scriptures,0
struggles with faith there no getting around it regardless of his actual faith joseph arthur is a christian folk rocker nothing wrong with that just a fact that grounds the sixteen stellar tracks of his third release redemption son though his belief runs deep the thrill in his work is that his faith does not come without continuous struggle like his idol and label owner peter gabriel arthur turns experience of the day to day into the epic unlike gabriel his music is still in touch with the simple verities he keeps his progressive tendencies in check relying on solid narrative details and the ragged beauty of his countertenor the title cut dear lord evidence each root their moral struggle in a recognizable situation absentee father social estrangement addiction the drawback is that every song reaches the same conclusion there nothing that god can not put right still it a testament to arthur gifts that the end does not nullify the journey,1

miseducation is an impressive show of lauryn talents my favorite songs on this album are too good to be true and ex factor lauryn singing rapping talents are amazing not to mention her acting talents too i was impressed by her strong voice and incredible rhythm this album definitly deserves the grammys it was nominated for i can not wait for lauryn next album and would absolutly love to see her perform live,1
last reviewers info would like to know where you got that info on lauryn hill saying she rather her kid starve than let her cd get in hands of a white person i am a woman and am considering buying this cuz i like her values and morals that i heard her sing of when a friend played zion for me i am a christian and i rarely listen to secular stuff but consider buying this but not if she hates people would like to know the source of your info lem,0
a blend of beauty and magic this cd is magical the lyrics are deep i have been a lauryn hill fan from the way back days of the fugees and she simply awesome it no surprise she nabbed NUMBER grammys from this album her first solo this represents what good music should be just buy it and listen to it magic to say the truth this album deserves NUMBER stars lauryn i thank god for your life and inspiration keep up the good work,1
classic lauren lyrics are very relavent to these days and times that we live in music is awesome vocals are still hot,1
lauren you are the best and keep getting better lauren i love you and your music i generally do not liste to younger artists because of the violence they promote but you are style is so different and you give all honor to god first and foremost the cd is just awesome keep up the good work,1
simultaneously pretentious and moronic this is even more brain dead than the average rap cd she certainly pretty enough why can not she hire someone to write her some decent songs to sing or one even,0
lauryn hill is an exceptional music artist for anyone who is knowledgeable about music artists you can only say one thing about lauryn hill she is totally blessed with an extreme talent her music is so profound because so many can relate to her realness it is clearly evident that when a host of people are moved with your music you have touched a place universal in the hearts of those who have listened when i first heard lauryn in sister act and found out that she was a rapper in the group fugees i said why no disrespect towards rappers i simply was floured when i heard her sing i knew right then that i would be hearing more from her in the near future and it was manifested in her debut album i am an artist myself and i would love to get the opportunity to work with her one day she is what you call a music perfectionist and how beautiful to know where all the credit comes from god she is one who truly knows why she is so successful,1
a decent album i have heard a lot better though although i will admit this cd has its charms i firmly believe that it should not garner a five star rating the detriments to this album include the following first the album is full of lauryn hill speaking inane lyrics that faintly resemble some sort of electronica instrument second the songs lack differentiation as in they are mostly the same beat and finally the bitter lyrics really give me a headache disregard the rambling run on sentances,0
this lauryn hill at her best this is one of the most sincere heartfelt cd i have listened to the tunes are great my favorite song is NUMBER p s her hidden tracks make for a nice surprise,1
individuality coupled with tradition words can only do a disservice to the scope and deep emotion that this album not only invokes but also infuses in its listeners listening to this one remembers the strength and power personified in the great sojourner truth epochal poem ai not i a woman listen to it yourself and you will see you sure are a woman lauryn hill,1
i would give it no stars if it was available this album is so full of phony music lauren honey you dissappointed me i guess i will stick to the fugees rather than on your solo this album has no real freshness it all sounds the same all the songs are of about the same beat there is nothing that lift my soul to even want to sing along with her lyrics the only one is that last song in the album which is an oldie just revised to a new version i really thought she could have done a lot better especially with winning all those grammy,0
i would have givin it less i would give this less cuz shes a terrible person and artist the only reason i bought this cd is because she said she would rather have her kids starve then a white person get her cd well i am waiting,0
not even NUMBER star utter garbage give me NUMBER NUMBER for every flat note lauren hill hits on this album and i would be a millionaire,0
i laughed hard when i heard about her medusa snake hairstyle bah not worth much hip hop you say maybe bull hop is more applicable here get a clue about real rap artists miss medusa,0
what is the big fuss about it funny i can never figure out the music business and mtv any more this is the most overrated overhyped album i have ever heard and yet they talk about it like it gods gift to music fans i admit there are a couple of tracks on this album that i like but the rest forget about it being a somewhat introspective person myself i understand that this album is a personal expression of sort but where is the melody on most of these tracks i love soulful heartfelt music as much as the next guy and i think maybe some other artists out there can learn that from lauryn however there is not much else in this album i think brandy is much better than lauryn but does not get nearly the credit she deserves,0
i hate rapp this just goes to show that there are not enough good artist around that they would name a rapp artist as best of anything,0
great cd after buying this cd for its hype i became an instant lauryn hill fan all songs on the cd were fantastic some better than others but all good my favorites are to zion ex factor forgive them father if you like hip hop you will love this cd,1
greatest of all times of course everyone knows that this album is a masterpiece it lauyrn greatest work regardless what people say about lauryn hill she is remarkable she like no other human being ya know i love the miseducation of lauyrn hill this is my NUMBER time buying the cd the first NUMBER times someone stole it from me and the other NUMBER i wore the cds out listening to them so much,1
real hip hop flava from a really tight artist this album shows that artist can really feel their music instead of just throwing lyrics together if you feel this c d check out the roots tribe called quest black eyed peas and common,1
very good i thought this video was very good i have not seen other versions so i can not compare them but i think it portrays the book excellently although the book is of course better the first tape is the best daniel radcliffe does a wonderful job playing young david the plot also follows the book and even the lines in the book very well the character are cast perfectly mr murdstone is horrible mr and mrs micawber are exactly how they are in the book in the second tape i wish they had not cut out the part with the old doctor or tommy traddles they focused more on his relationship with dora and agnes in the movie whereas there are many themes going on at once in the book also some little things like agnes does not seem to take quite so kindly to dora in the movie as she does in the book but maggie smith is excellent as betsy trotwood of course overall this is a fabulous movie even if you have not read the book you will want to after you see this,1
drags i enjoyed the beginning of this book but after a while it just drags could have been a nice story in the new yorker but as a book it just does not cut it forced my way to the end summary couple of guys want to get to this obscure place cause they like the name jump through lots of hoops trying to get permission one of them dies permission comes that all folks,0
i will never buy another creative card wow i love this card easy to install setup on xp was no problem at all deep rich sound naked music has never sounded so good played counter strike footsteps were crisp and clear i recently purchased a creative audigy card after install somewhat random system crashes plauged my heretofore fine system i call the crashes somewhat random because they occurred randomly while playing counter strike and always when i tried to play sound from two different programs driver updates did not help at all the first thing i did before writing this review was to check those old problems all gone simply with a turtle beach install problem solved and with better sound can not beat it great card great price i love it,1
horrible bought it one and half year ago from circuit city used it mainly for general computer work not gaming when i upgraded to a newer machine and try to install it on it has problem with driver on xp media center edition can not record midi from my yamaha keyboard and they do not provide support for it any more what kind of business is this vendor in only one and half year later they do not provide any technical support for their products,0
what a shame there is a lot of background music in this film that never made this collection unfortunetly it was also some of the best music from the movie why do not they put together real soundtracks that include all of the artists used instead they always give us their own watered down choices bummer,0
how can something so simple be so complexly beautiful when you play this cd you will hear no human voices you will hear some background sounds of nature birds crickets the sound of water the crackling of a fire etc but the main feature is an unimaginably beautiful masterfully played flute and some soft percussion that i do not know how to describe i strongly recommend this cd to anyone i just played it yesterday after a gap of many years and i am now kicking myself for having been away from it for so long it so beautiful and relaxing perfect for anyone there are only four tracks but they are long and it easy to lose yourself into them,1
why did i waste my there is only one good song on this whole album do not waste your money unless you are super religious then maybe you can relate to this music,0
buy another laminator i thought this would be a cool laminator to have for my club boy was i wrong my documents were wrinkly i even ran the documents through a few times the last time it ate the carrier the binder part was not very good either you have to use special folders i can not believe the manufacturer intended this for the office when it can not even support my little club laminating needs it goes to show a good looking product does not necessarily delivers,0
everybody bombs now and then fans either love or hate this album i fall into the later category for this is without doubt the worst iggy pop album and quite probably one of the worst rock and roll albums ever recorded bar none the songs are unimaginative the musicianship lacking and most amazing of all is that the production is completely incompetent amazing considering super producer don was handles these chores it surprizing that this did not completely kill iggy recording career a prime example is the cover of shaking all over the song shows potential then never takes flight instead stalling and crashing big time the who never imagined the song this way and with good reason and its among the better efforts on the album try as i might i just can not listen to more than a few minutes at a time it is that bad,0
great science videos my children love these videos although they are just NUMBER and NUMBER years old they learn something everytime they watch any of them and so do i these videos have a great way of presenting the amazing wonders of nature and god handywork all around us we purchased the NUMBER dvd setmoody science classics NUMBER dvd set and it was well worth it,1
rip off crooks ordered this t shirt for my son and old glory the supplier did not send the order and just relinguished the order with no explanation warning do not buy from old glory it a waiste of time they will get your money and then a few months later refund with no explanation old glory is keeping the money in the bank and getting interest for the few months till the refund,0
stream of consciousness style detracts from value sorry to part company with the crowd here the author thesis that news and ad media severely blur the distinction between real and unreal sounded intriguing and i wanted to see how the author developed it unfortunately after a few dozen pages it seemed like the book was a good example of that thesis and not an elucidation of it it reminded me of james joyce and while joyce style can be wonderful for a novel it kind of stinks for an expository work my second thought is that publishers have got to stop paying people by the word the author point seemed reasonable and based on common sense my quarrel was he could have made it more succinctly with better support and with less verbosity oh well enough said,0
worth watching from start to finish saw this about NUMBER times on tvloved it more and more every timeshocking powerful action moviewith small bits of humorlike when mason storm gets down on his knees to look like he playing fair with the robbers in the storeand he still kicks their ass regardless even while on his kneesnow that funny and powerful lebrock is lusciously pretty and very talented if you like seagal see marked for death exit wounds and other great titles i got this on dvd NUMBER days ago it worth the thrills laughs and excitement every watchsee this movieif you like kelly lebrock then see weird science good and interesting movie,1
ouch this movie hurts me to watch it steven segal gets shot up put in a coma and then he goes off killing people for revenge the action is really cheesy the plot is awful and the one liners make you want to shoot segal steven segal can not act notice how his movies all seem to have three words above the law hard to kill straight to video oops there is a quote in this movie after steven segal shoots at a guy crotch i missed i never miss they must be smaller than i thought this line was a mess up the correct line is i missed i always miss i must be lamer than i thought if you wish to suck seven years off of your life then go ahead otehrwise steer clear,0
the worst subtitles awards goes to i can not believe the other reviewers were reviewing the same dvd this is a great movie do not get me wrong it kurasawa after all my one star is for the people at mei ah who put out this dvd whoever did the subtitle translation did not speak english well enough to graduate from a level one esl class the subtitles are truly terrible sometimes bizarre and i thought at times i was dreaming i was watching a monty python skit alas i was not this was for real such a shame,0
soap this dvd set is to complete my existing collection it is one of the most enjoyable shows that i have ever watched i recommend it to everyone,1
good book but it is a very good book i learned some interesting things but i guess the subject is more deep i found the book a little incomplete,1
a fine game once but it will not run on modern macs this is a powerpc game up through mac os x NUMBER NUMBER snow leopard intel macs had rosetta a technology for running powerpc binaries on intel machines apple discontinued rosetta in mac os x NUMBER NUMBER lion so there is not way to run this game or any other powerpc binaries without emulating earlier versions of mac os x or booting an earlier version on your mac which might not be possible with machines released after lion so do not buy it unless you are familiar with these issues caveat emptor,0
portable thoreau i got this book within a timely manner and am very satisfied with the product and the seller,1
oh please not another one again i just do not understand mr grisham maniacal obssesion with juries who knows how many lawyer and jury books the guy has written all i know is this i am sick and tired of reading about these dumb juries the runaway jury was the only thing that was anywhere near decent that grisham has poured from his stinking pen why does he think the average joe is interested in judicial matters i for one am not,0
all arise the honorable judge grisham is back after skipping christmas and most recently bleachers i had begun to believe that john grisham had been abducted by aliens but with the last juror grisham comes home to what he knows best legal literature the last juror tells the story of a young newspaperman who scrapes his funds together along with help from family to buy the clanton times his old paper when he was starting out in the world of journalism playing his cards right and reporting on the dangerous story of a brutal crime and the trial that ensues the paper is off and running but when perpetrator of the crime is released from prison early and members of the jury start turning up dead the people of small town clanton are faced with the vengeance of the criminal and his family okay the resolution of the story is predictable but the last juror but the writing is vintage grisham and marks his almost prodigal return to legal drama and that certainly worth the wait the horseman,1
the last juror i am a huge fan of john grisham have read all of his books but i have to admit i have been disappointed with his last few books and the last juror takes the cake in that department it has a great plot but mr grisham goes no where with it it starts off very strong but half way through and all the way to the end it is awful i found myself skimming through the pages asking myself what in the world does this have to do with the story any grisham fan out there should read it just to read it but do not expect anything that grisham potential has to offer,0
very disappointing being a huge grisham fan i could not wait to read the last juror that quickly turned to being unable to wait to finish it the book began great but quickly changed it just seemed like it did not know where it was going so many things too many things were going on i pass on this one,0
boring i took this book on vacation expecting a great read and it turned out to be a boring tedious read if not for the grisham name this book would not be on any best seller list reading this book was a chore not a pleasure i finished the book and was still waiting for something to happen do not waste your time,0
worst book to me others find it best this is the worst book i have ever read because it was advertised as a thriller but there was zero suspense it was such a boring book that it a wonder that i even finished it in contrast i read the da vinci code in NUMBER days because i simply could not put the book down if the last juror had been advertised as a novel about a small southern town somewhat like to kill a mockingbird i would have had a different mindset and probably would have enjoyed it more i read mockingbird in NUMBER days also,0
if you want to read about small town living at first the last juror held my interest like most of grisham books do after the murder trial which takes place very quickly the book begins to sag it becomes a diary of small town living as seen through the eyes of city slicker willie traynor and does not pick up much again what a disappointment,0
grisham not so stunning comeback this having been his first legal thriller in a couple years i was not completely impressed by the movement or character development in this book i have read all of grisham books and would easily place this near the bottom of the list the initial concept is interesting but his storytelling was lackluster and characters a bit cliched i kept thinking the crime family resembled the clampetts and his protaganist was unbelievable at times a lot of the characters were shallow and the end was disappointing if you are going to read this wait for the paperback or get it from the library or just re read the good ones a time to kill the client the brethren and the pelican brief,0
fast reading barely worth it several good court scenes are not enough to salvage this book as grisham stretches the plot needlessly through page after page actually although this book is fast enough reading you can get through it even faster by checking out the plot summary on the dust jacket it takes you up to page NUMBER out of about NUMBER even then the ending is rather anticlimactic hard core grisham fans wanting to preserve their record of reading everything he written will have a reason to read this book the rest of us can surely find better ways to spend even the short time needed to read it,0
but rarely have so many cliches about the south been found in one single place the black lady with NUMBER children all with ph d was too much for me her sexually adventurous NUMBER th child was more believable,0
the man has lost it i am still a big fan of grisham earlier books especially pelican brief but i think he run out of ideas the last juror is tired boring derivative and a waste of time,0
what a disappointment john grisham should stop churning out a book a year and focus on regaining the skills he had when he wrote a time to kill each novel has become progressively less satifying i barely skimmed the last hundred pages of the last juror that it for me with grisham books,0
the worst grisham book out there i have read most if not all of grishams books and this one was by far the worst i have actually stopped reading it about NUMBER NUMBER the way through because i have zero interest in finishing it it is very boring has no suspense and jumps around a lot i kept waiting for something to happen and nothing ever did,0
fast to slow page turner i have enjoyed a few grisham novels but this one fell mostly flat for this reader i guess i prefer the fast paced legal action thrillers that he is known for it started out great with a horrific murder and dramatic small town trial but detoured quickly into a commentary of life in mississippi in the NUMBER which made it a slow page turner for me,0
a character study the last juror seems to show grisham change as an author in his early works he wrote suspense stories in the last juror the suspense which is secondary to the development of wonderful characters miss callie is a wonderful woman who shows how a powerful force for good can make her whole family better it is worth reading this book just to meet her the rest of the small town characters such as harry rex and baggy as well as will himself and his grandmother are wonderfully drawn some reviewers have commented that the book lacked suspense it seems that grisham is moving in his work rather than a fast moving book such as angels and demons with little character development grisham is now writing slower moving books with wonderful characters the testament and the king of torts are examples i think that the new grisham is every bit as enjoyable as the early grisham but just a little different,1
a fun fast read not familiar with grisham work other than the fact that he seems suspiciously prolific i was not expecting anything particularly special therefore i was very plesantly surprised by how well written compelling and seemingly personal this very entertaining story turned out to be great for that long plane ride or to take along on vacation this smartly written story which says quite a bit about the author sensitive impressions of the world around him will keep you interested every chapter of the way,1
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz what a snoozer i read this book a while ago but recently thought about it again when someone brought up bad books i had never read a grisham novel before this one and i really expected so much more with all the hype his novels get as it stands i have not picked up a grisham novel since reading this one what a terrible book maybe i missed something but there did not seem to be any noteworthy plotlines to warrant writing a book about i kept thinking when is all the action going to happen when is all the intrigue and suspense going to take place well here the answer never i made it all the way to the end of the book only because i did not want to think i wasted my time reading the earlier chapters i was going to make it through the book even if it killed me but at least that would have been more action than was in the book,0
definitely not his best work i found the storyline of this book to be very interesting but it kept deviating away from the story and introduced way too many characters that in my opinion had little or nothing to do with the story it almost as if this was a short story stretched into novel length either that or the author was under a deadline to crank the next book out and this is the result still overall it was not terrible but still not one of his best works that for certain,0
this is the worst book he has ever written this is the by far the worst book i have ever purchased i would love to have my money back what was john grisham thinking about when he wrote this obviously he was not thinking i have read everyone of his books and if the rest of them are going to be like this i will have to pass i am an avid reader of john i am the one that can not wait until his next book comes out i will have to wait next time because i will not ever read another one like this,0
grisham has lost his touch drivel and more drivel grisham has lost his touch you can not write good suspense novels using harlequin romance techniques filling the pages with unsubstantial filler if you liked the pelican brief and was unsatisfied with the bleachers then you and i will agree on this one,0
last juror nice book but not up to his previous work did not bother to finish his work must have been in a hurry under pressure from publisher would not recommend,0
can not go wrong i have been a dmb fan for quite a while now and have always loved their music but hearing this cd just made me like the songs even more i did not really enjoy bluegrass before hearing this cd but after hearing this album the only thing i can listen to is this tribute this is the best tribute i have ever heard every song is done in a way that adds more to the original version with every strum and pick i would highly recommend this cd to anyone who enjoys dave matthews band or just bluegrass in general if you do not believe me then listen to the samples no matter how long you listen to this breathe NUMBER tribute to dmb you will understand what i mean and know that when you stop you will be thiving for more this song will become an addiction after you hear it do yourself a favor and buy breathe NUMBER trust me on this one you will not be dissapointed,1
great this order came in really fast and it is a classic,1
it tries and tries get a big cauldron next drop in blade runner laura croft and krull mix haphazardly throw in pointless and gratuitous nude scenes a pair of boots with six inch heels and a weak plot simmer in a dank dark place for two hours and you have the equivalent of generation while the idea behind the movie shows some minor promise the constant sub plots and generic fight scenes throw the whole film off center even the obvious physical talents of bai ling do not save this film despite her best efforts the special effects supporting the film pseudo science are ghastly not in a good way it looks like a ball of worms threw up on the actors this is a b movie and a poor example to boot if not for the driving music score and the sheer beauty of bai ling it would not even rate that high while not worth the NUMBER it cost on amazon it might be worth NUMBER on but they were too smart to include it in their lineup,0
excellent film this is what should be coming out of hollywood now this film from NUMBER is thought provoking and truly entertaining without any silly special effects to blur the meaning,1
omg why did we ever think this rap was cool timothy bottoms was so cute in NUMBER and all those shower scenes and the NUMBER swimming pool scenes as of aug NUMBER this movie is just a bit of nostalgia not worth the NUMBER NUMBER length sure glad i rented vs purchased recently i tried to watch the strawberry statement and it was so dated and long i had to bail on it we were innocent and naive to buy into these films when they were released very predictable and formulaic imagine us cool kids buying into the flimsy films like the paper chase love story romeo and juliet ad nauseum,0
call home mr hart and tell your mother everytime i see this film i get so glad that i dropped out of law school kingfield is alive well and lurking out there if you are thinking about going to law school see this film if you have time between reading canned briefs the little questions that tumble in your brain are really there the stress over grades is real the classmates who crash burn are real i can not recommend this film too highly to potential NUMBER ls,1

classic mystery no major flaws i think the serial killer plot has been done to death but back when the prime suspect series started it did not seem tired it was very enjoyable to see this program again so long after it was on television my only complaint is that it is a bit too long i think the editing could be tighter but the plot and the acting can not be faulted as all the men on the detective squad are so shocked at a woman being put in charge of an investigation this aspect of the movie seems very dated now contrary to another reviewer i found the dvd quality very good this was made for tv and one can not expect the same vivid image of a theatrical feature two dual layer discs for a NUMBER minute program certainly provides sufficient data rate personally i do not think this has good replay value unless you intend to wait another ten years to watch it again as such the product seems overpriced to me this is probably a better candidate for a rental,1
death at a funeral this comedy is done as only the british can do them when i first saw it in the theater i was not having a good day and did not want to be there i found my self laughing a lot i enjoyed it so much we bought the dvd we had some friends over and showed it they loved it if you are honest you can recoginze characters from your own experience,1
funny movie one of the funniest movies i have ever seen it gets funnier every time i watch it that why i purchased a copy for my movie collection,1
offbeat humor i suppose this type of humor is not for me as i barely cracked a smile throughout the course of the entire movie this movie presents you with uncomfortable situations and expects you to laugh nervously,0

great plot twist this is one of those movies that after you have watched it you go back and watch it again to see the clues to the ending and plot twist that you missed i rented from the redbox for a buck so i was out nothing if it sucked but it was a great movie so i bought it in blue ray remember bruce willis in the sixth sense it is much like passengers i do not want to ruin it for you just buy it you will love it,1
painfully dull poorly written rip off spoilers fearless meets the sixth sense except that fearless was excellent and the sixth sense was good this movie is bad hathaway and wilson have absolutely zero chemistry and all they do is blab on and on about nothing the other characters walk in and out then disappear only we hardly realize that since they are barely on screen for more than a minute at a time by the time the end hits all involved are greatly relieved that it over for everyone,0
ukrainian tenor in later life many of these are from recordings made when this fabulous ukrainian tenor was old the russians worked him well into his NUMBER s but what a voice even though these are from his later life they are better than nothing this voice is definitely one of a kind with emotion so involving that it often draws tears to listeners eyes people who have only heard this recording of his voice should get earlier examples as a younger man kozlovsky sang with the most incredibly bel canto line squeezing every bit of meaning from the words when i recently asked a very famous modern russian baritone what he thought of kozlovsky voice he said he did not like it as a trained singer i pressed him to explain further and he just muttered he sings in the old way whatever the old way is i want it it has passion and subtle nuances of feeling quite different from some present day singers tendency to bellow while trying to demonstrate drama,1
learn css in record time if you are new to css cascading style sheets and want to get up to speed in no time then russ weakley teach yourself css in NUMBER minutes is the perfect guide to accomplishing that task in its simplest form css is a way to quickly style web pages and be able to write html quickly and not have to worry about keeping track of fonts colors etc while maintaining a uniform style all throughout your web site if you need to learn how to use css quickly and efficiently i highly recommend this great time from sams you will not be disappointed note this book is for beginners only any experienced css developer will want to go elsewhere as this book is only for newbies highly recommended,1
NUMBER editors and a proofreader walk into a bar the following comments pertain to the sixth printing june NUMBER copy of the book as noted by other reviewers this version is riddled with numerous and in some cases serious errors that severely affect the overall worth of the book in particular lesson NUMBER positioning two columns with a header and a footer is the victim of an almost complete lack of editing proofreading i challenge anyone to follow the directions in this section and come out on the other side with anything that looks like the example in the lesson the first few chapters are serviceable the rest is hit or miss from what i experienced too bad,0
service engine light this cap has caused my gas cap light to alert numerous times i had a hard time making it fit so i will not smell gas fumes when opening the driver side door after a trip if you are buying this product for a NUMBER silverado i would consider spending an extra NUMBER or NUMBER bucks on a cap that will not give you mentioned problems,0
i should have believed the other reviewers even after reading the bad reviews this product received from other reviewers i still purchased it it is pretty easy to set up but once connected to my pc it had very inconsistent behavior the device would lose connection to the server after a being idle for NUMBER hours and require a reset the video performance was awful with the included software tversity freeware media server made video performance better but fast forward and rewind would not work do to some video conversion routines being run by tversity music files would play and sounded good but navigating through my music selection was nearly impossible because the music search feature does not work really does not work at all i upgraded firmware and played all sorts of games to try and get the device to work finally i gave up and shipped it back to amazon the thing was just more trouble than it was worth fyi amazon returns were great,0
too poppy david bowie seems to have gotten pulled into the candy coated simplistic pop rock genre that dominates mtv and radios all over the us his new album lacks the unique and artistic style of usual david bowie too many generic drum and guitar tracks do not bother if you are interested in buying anything buy space oddity the best album ever made,0
let it open up the first listen i am betting that you will not get it you probably will not even remember much except for the striking thursday child it has an awesome video too once you realise the theme so give it a few listens and it will bloom it a fine finale to his trilogy earthling is definately the peak of energy but as hours now comes after it chills you out in the reflective mood maybe not among his classics but very enjoyable and worth it,1
bad previous review was never printed i will condense this was trash too bad i was a great bowie fan,0
if i am dreaming all my life what a comeback ok i know that bowie never really disappeared from the scene but he been foundering for some time this will hopefully signal th end of that period as it is a really good recording i am not sure how many people will find all the metaphors in here perhaps there are not even supposed to be so many but i just kept finding them added many of the lyrics just fit my life right now and the questions i find myself asking more and more ie were we meant to last were we whether we were or not this cd should at least for a darned long time,1
loved it reading through the table of contents of the book i had this sense of familiarity the first few chapters have been titled and themed in such a way that it bring to mind the creation story found in the bible granted that not what this book is about and i do not believe the story of creation found in the pages of genesis is meant to be taken as literal scientific fact however i appreciate the sense of wonder and significance the framing gives to the beginning of time even though taken as is it not as if the beginning of our universe was lacking in wonder still by borrowing a bit from the structure of the genesis story i think ackroyd gives a bit of familiarity to the history and science he sharing ackroyd weaves together science a storytellers skill easy page layout and fascinating pictures and illustrations for a good overview of the very beginning of our planet to the final emergence of homo sapiens,1
k n air filter this product really allows my suzuki gsxr to breathe better its a great item and i will be sure to recommend you to other bike riding friends of mine,1
good breather its a different shape than the stock filter for my NUMBER xv NUMBER but the holes line up fine and it fits well in my airbox i definitely notice the increased performance from better airflow and its reusable,1
a great filter that gave me extra power i bought this for my suzuki boulevard c NUMBER because i wanted a washable filter that lasted a long time i heard people talking about how a k n filter gave them extra power i did not really believe all that but after i installed this filter on my bike there was a small yet noticeable increase in power i am happy extra performance on a washable filter that will last me for the life of the bike,1
good purchase experience the filter was exactly as identifed when ordered it was shipped promptly and packaged well enough to protect it during shipment,1
great price NUMBER honda goldwing very good price for a performance filter that can be washed and reused plus i believe that k n filters flow more air,1
not great but is okay all right adjust well on the bike however i think the original has a best presentation and even better fit i should clarify that there is nothing wrong with this device and it is too early to assess its performance is currently installed and working well in general i have no complaints,1
did not fit properly i purchased the k n ha NUMBER as a replacement for the stock filter in my NUMBER honda cbr NUMBER rr the fit of the k n was poor at best i did manage to get it in but not without considerable effort now that it in the bike i am a bit worried about it sealing properly if i had it to do again i would go with a different hi flo aftermarket filter or the oem,0
k n for every ride i own i always purchase k n air filters for every vehicle i own i did not know that amazon had the best price for them i will definitely be using amazon to purchase all my k n stuff in the future,1
would not work the sharpener sat around for a month or so before i used it when i went to use it it did not even have sufficient power to sharpen a pencil amazon would not accept a return because i was out of the warranty period,0
not heavy duty this sharpener is a joke i have a small school and need to sharpen NUMBER pencils a day bought this heavy duty model however it shuts off after sharpening NUMBER pencils do not waste your money folks i wish someone could steer me to a really heavy duty product,0
do not buy this expensive as it is i thought i have something that would give me no trouble it eats pencils the led gets broken and stuck in the machine not allowing any further sharpening and you can not even take it apart and fix it an unfortunate waste of time and money jn,0
mediocre in my opinion no movie does any book justice the book version is always better this one is not a great remake of the book i bought another version that was better would not highly recommend,0
this is not the shell seekers this film bears only a passing resemblance to rosamund pilcher the shell seekers the director watered down the book powerful plot to weak tea and you will barely recognize the characters angela lansbury does her best but can not help the tepid writing the casting was almost completely off the mark danus is particularly badly cast i expected a better film from the hallmark hall of fame this was so bad it took me NUMBER trys to get through to the end do not buy it in fact it hardly worth renting reread the book instead,0
quiet then loud this recording takes the dynamics to the point where some passages are barely audible and you have to strain to hear them and then as you are straining and your ears are completely open and unprotected you get hit with the frying pan it like being abused with music an anxiety inducing recording tried listening to it numerous times now i am either donating it to the library or perhaps simply throwing it as far away from my person as i can without damaging my rotator cuff,0
delta sigma book hi i bought this book sometime last month received it couple of weeks back it was delivered promptly but the book print quality seems to be bad in fact it looks like a fake looks more like a photocopy of the original book so much for paying this kind of money to buy the,0
fun to dance to this collection of music is so cool it gives you a quick glimpse of alot of different artists it has nice catchy tunes all through the cd,1
one of the top ten worst movies of all time i am still in shell shock that people of quality such as chloe sevigny stephen rea could even finish filming this piece of dog doo doo this thing is beyond horrid there are not enough words to convey how much this thing stunk the movie starts out ok steadily begins to make less less sense becomes just utterly non sensical and then takes a very sharp turn into pure absurd idiocy and way over the top gore none of it making any sense mind you none of it not the time structure of events not the things taking place and most assuredly not the moronic ending i was quite angry that i spent NUMBER NUMBER at my discount video to even rent it,0
poorly done fist of that version of the national anthem was the pitts i mean all of those train and carrying on was ridiculous first off no one will and ever sing the national anthem like whitney houston beyonce did an alright job people are making that up to be something its not thank you for your time and consideration sincerly yours a music major at florida stae university,0
short stories for philosophers literature snobs and lovers of the unusual albert camus born in algeria in NUMBER won the nobel prize in literature in NUMBER and died three years later but his writings live on this collection of six unusual strange endinged stories will probably be of interest to a wide range of short story fans sometimes seemingly vague and symbolic and with odd titles and endings they are thoroughly enjoyable and readable though similar in complexity subject matter and settings vary greatly a woman joins her fabric selling husband on a business trip a detongued former missionary awaits his replacement barrel makers strike a prisoner is foisted on a schoolmaster an artist works amidst ever changing chaos and an engineer visits inhabitants near the site of a future dam exile and the kingdom is an excellent strange brief book other strange short stories blind willow sleeping woman by haruki murakami,1
can you say cardboard with cheese flavor like the other doctor kracker snack i reviewed they are as hard as a rock reminds me of pasteboard with cheese flavoring,0
personal and universal if you love paul williams and if you love dylan this is an unbeatable experience focusing as it does on what some might call lost years of highs and lows of bob career it is all the same for paul williams who takes it all in and lovingly dissects every speck of dylan output paul williams was a lone voice in the wilderness back in the dylan what happened days so this serves as an extension of that important book,1
drew barrymore has made her opps movie once again drew barrymore has been having a hard time making good movies after making the the movie ever after which i thought was a okay movie which i gave but home fries was a horrible movie with a messed up script and plot plus i thought it was too dark to be a comedy,0
boring but barley okey this is the dulliest unsatisfiting of all time even though drew barrymore is in it it still does not steal the show the middle was okey but the rest was just plain garbage,0
home fired it is a very good thing that drew barrymore did not choose this film to kick start her career this film was a bomb from the word go it was overly campy and completely unbelieveable while the premise of the story is somewhat interesting the depiction is absolute blah do yourself a favor if you must see this film rent it first,0
best tv series ever ever ever ever ever as the cover said this is the tv series that still stands as the benchmark for others knock out performances by the incomparable laurence olivier jeremy irons and last but not least in my opnion the best character ever put down on film sebastian by anthony andrews well all will know this story about romantic yearning friendship loss and mostly the english charm of it in a concluding scene with charles ryder he was told by an old studentfriend that that charm of sebastian was dangerous and that it almost took the best of him and that might be true in a general sense once seen it is hard to come to terms with it first that this series is finite and second the tragic fate of indeed the most charming person on screen yet sebastian that sort of friend that we are all looking for but who is so hard to find,1
great art based on great art this production need not be limited to ever made for tv this is one of the greatest and most profound movies ever made every element of every scene is superb and riveting i watched it again twenty years after first seeing it and enjoyed it even more with my southern baptist wife who kept insisting let us watch just one more episode this story is esentially catholicism talking to itself through both the main characters and the sheer majesty of the brideshead estate castle howard this work is epically and evengelically catholic anyone who sees brideshead revisited will find his tongue stopped about pedophile priests and hitler pope because his mind has been slowly platonically wrestled around to see the glory of god church on earth waugh is a midwife first author second and i would say the same of mortimer who made this production happen thank god for both men and for this production,1
it does not ever get better than this they show this on pbs sometimes so even if you choose not to purchase the best drama ever to grace the NUMBER inch screen you can still see it it is so far above anything else to first appear on television you may wonder how it ever was produced perhaps that is a story in of itself in any case it is truly one of a kind and to not see it would be like never seeing dr zhivago or casablanca or any of the other larger than life tragic love stories of this century,1
brides head revisited this product was ompossible to watch the sequence of episodes was all mixed upfor example episode NUMBER was only able to be played by pressing episode NUMBER and so on when there were three episodes on a disc the middle episode would not respondand could not be played i was amazed to receive such an inferior product from amazon,0
blu ray version washed out and colorless this is one of my favorite tv shows of all time but i have never been so disappointed in any product as i was with this one do not bother buying the blu ray version it has been remastered in some way for high definition that results in a flat colorless picture that is overly bright and has little detail i had the same problem with the new version of upstairs downstairs also by acorn media i watched about fifteen minutes of it before i gave up and got out the dvd version and watched it on my up converting dvd player with the dvd version the picture is a little blurry but at least there is color and detail and the picture is not flat if you already have it on dvd leave well enough alone if you do not have it at all do not buy the blu ray version invest in a NUMBER up converting dvd player instead,0
as wonderful as i remembered it can not go wrong with the content amazing acting photography storyline only complaint is a couple of minutes of slightly blurry picture on one of the discs so glad to own this for my viewing whenever i want,1
bird is always bird its ok for a single dvd however if you are looking for an extended documentary on his life buy the big NUMBER or NUMBER dvd volume by ken burns there nothing like it and it spends quite a lot of time on bird its a must have for jazz fans,0
beware of seller i ordered this book mid april for mother day it did not arrive at the estimated time i waited another week then contacted the dealer they said i needed to wait the maximum shipping time before they could resolve the issue it still did not arrive so i contacted them again and they stated that they would send the book now i waited again and it still did not arrive so i sent another email amazon has issued a refund because the seller now says that the book is apparently out of stock i feel they should have said that from the beginning,0
a good starter book to help focus on wwii books of interest i really liked this book i use it to further add books to my wishlist dunnigan mini summaries of included books are loaded with details i have several books by dunnigan all of which i have enjoyed reading some other reviewers have provided less than glowing reviews of some of his books i try to keep things in perspective so flaws noted are not ignored given his background and experiences i suspect james dunnigan might be a very interesting author to meet in person,1
schiller this is the second edition of this book the translator spent years on researching and putting schiller works together he worked closely with the germans to make sure that he got this right however the second edition has the translator very own poem the translators apology to the reader as he had to make some corrections in his own translating schiller was a controversy of sorts in his time many of his poetry has to do with his one love laura the lady who first captured his heart and had great impact on his life,1
what a disappointment i agree wholeheartedly with the first reviewer what is the point of this boxed set i have yesyears as well and almost every other yes cd this boxed set adds very little that is new and might only be worth buying for someone without any yes cd or who is new to listening to the band other boxed sets jethro tull bob dylan bruce springsteen eric clapton etc were done very well by their respective record companies and make a lot of sense the one good thing about this box set is that supposedly all the music was remastered if rhino goes back and re releases some of yes albums with bonus tracks as they are doing for the band chicago i would definitely be interested in buying that,0
yesyore judicious choice of tracks by steve howe makes a seemingly inessential purchase how many best of repackagings from the band in recent years hard to pass up disdaining the live tracks solo meanderings the fish and subpar b sides that afflicted yesyears this NUMBER hour package sounds and looks great nothing incl america is abridged and liner notes make a strong case for yes rivaling king crimson as musical pioneers packaging as always with rhino is exemplary,1
not original artists this is not a compilation of original releases it is a demo of publishing co soundtracks,0
barbara crampton looks great in leather great horror movie jeffrey combs does very well in this one,1
i am unhappy i did not receive this item i live in brazil and i asked to a friend of mine who was in the united states to bring it to me the package was sealed but the blades were not inside,0
fantastic but the design of this basketball system is fantastic it is so easy to move and so easy to raise or lower the backboard it is sturdier than most movable systems and with the NUMBER wheels and the leaver action you can easily move it from one place to the other without emptying the reservoir if it is a windy day you can easily lower the back board now that i have raved about the product let me give you the negative if you are not mechanically inclined do not even attempt to put this together the directions are terrible and there are a lot of moving parts after putting it together there are a lot of left over nuts and bolts and you wonder what you have forgotten but the directions are very bad so you had to guess at what they meant so i recommend that you hire someone to put this together which is what we had to do to get this put up took the person many hours to get it together and he was not working by an hourly rate,1
pure magic morgan llywelyn is one the most gifted writers writing today and lion of ireland is her masterpiece you feel her passion and the love she has for the irish in her words and her unique storytelling talent makes this book one of the best books i have ever read,1
a truly magical book this book is a master piece this was the best book i ever read and i should know i am only NUMBER but i have read more than my share of books this should be turned into a movie brian of boruma makes william wallace look like a child and if they are lookin for somebody to have a small part like turlough i will gladly play the part,1
trite and predictable i was excited to read this book based on the reviews my love of history i was extremely disappointed the characters here are one dimensional uttering predictable catch phrases and are basically uninteresting i got through about NUMBER pages and could not even finish the main character is increadibly driven and consequently his reactions throughout the story become entirely predictable he has no depth and the author does not create any kind of sympathy empathy or interest between the character and the reader i really did not care what happened to him or any of the characters in the book i think i will stick with bernard cornwell or sharon kay penman,0
a big disappointment i disagree with the reviewer who characterized the author as a poor writer she is not the problem is the content after reading the first NUMBER pages i put the book down finally admitting to myself that i really did not care what ms powell thought or opined about anything i was finding her blog turned book to be just one more rant from a neurotic new yorker a genre for which my tolerance peaked several years ago it was never that high to begin with unfortunately a friend had given me the book thinking i enjoy it because of my fondness for julia child maybe that contributed to my reaction to the author juxtaposing herself with julia child invites one to think about issues of character style and substance on all those measures ms powell suffers my recommendation see the movie but forget the book,0
catastrophic hissy fit how do you take an idea with so much promise and turn it into an excruciating read you allow someone like julie powell to write about it that how never in my entire life have i found the narrator of a book more irritating than i did powell more a filthy mouthed diatribe of her whiney ways than the entertaining cookalogue it should have been had julia child lived to read julie julia undoubtedly she would have deemed it just as disrespectful and non serious as she did julie and her project i wanted to like this book i really did in the end however it nothing more than something powell claims to have regularly on subway platforms a catastrophic hissy fit one can only hope the movie fares better but then again it could hardly do worse two stars for managing to steer unlikeability and awful writing to the top of the bestseller chart kudos for that amazing feat at least,0
political only why did she feel the need to knock republicans at every turn a real sign of low intelligence spoiled book completely she is very opinionated in all her thoughts and filthy talk to boot thinks she is sophisticated bah bad book,0
terrible i found this book to be simply unreadable too much trite dialogue and a very unlikable whiny author i muddled through to page NUMBER and had to put it down if you are interested in julia child i highly recommend my life in france by julia child excellent,0
a rambling mess i picked this book up with an expectation of a fun memoir read the premise was unique cooking all NUMBER recipes from julia child art of french cooking i expected a fun romp of cooking mishaps triumphant cuisines interesting tales of kitchen disasters and enjoyments but instead it was nothing but a misguided attempt at a so called memoir very very disappointing,0
movie better than the book i have to say for the first time in my life the movie is way better than the book it is totally disjointed and full of unnecesary profanity the author comes across as very immature and a total whiner do not bother buying it the movie is much more enjoyable,0
stay as a blogger this is a terrible book julie powell is on her own admission not a good cook and the text proves it and on the evidence of this book she is not a good writer either i am accustomed to swearing it is generally a substitute for vocabulary but the use of foul language throughout is distasteful perhaps her moment of fame will inspire her i doubt it she should stick to blogging poor julia passe she may be but she must be turning in her grave at this travesty,0
profanity detracts from material i can count on one hand the books i have thrown away in my lifetime of NUMBER years i treasure books and respect them but unfortunately this one had to be kept away from anyone else i did not get past the first ten pages the level of profanity was so distracting that i could not focus on what the author was saying her writing is rich and i appreciate that but the book is now smoldering in our burn barrel outside,0
too much julie not enough julia the politics gets really old really fast as do the day to day lives of the self absorbed and rather dull cast of characters i really wanted to like the book but like a number of other reviewers i could only make it part way through ps enough with the f word already it may be hip but it jarring especailly when used incessently,0
do not buy this just because you liked the blog i read the julie julia project blog occasionally and enjoyed it i thought that the book would be similar but it was not i do not object to irreverent opinions and random stories in a foodie memoir but she took out too much of what made the blog fun and what she replaced it with lacks wit and charm powell writing feels forced and her contrived expositions of how hip liberal and shocking she is wants to be pall quickly,0
i did not like this book after reading some of the reviews i see that there seem to be two sets of camps regarding this book folks either loved it or hated it i guess i will have hang out with the haters julie powell comes off as an extremely unpleasant immature little princess it a good idea a year cooking from julia child french cooking book but it just so hard to read the whole thing is snark and whine and it tiresome after a few chapters,0
do not waste your time or money on this awful book very poorly written book it all over the place the f word seemed to be thrown in simply to fill space at times i did not have the slightest clue what she was talking about she tried to be funny and failed miserably and besides being boring and poorly written she frequently takes cheap shots at republicans which were just distracting and irritating simply put this book is nothing like i was expecting and i am so glad that i got a copy from the library and did not contribute one dime to this woman bank account i returned it to the library the very next day unfinished very disppointing this was such a good idea for a book and a movie but julie powell just was not up to the task at least not to my standards,0
i tried i wanted to like this book i have curled up with it a couple times now thinking that i was just being difficult and should give it another chance i absolutely love laurie colwin writing surely i should enjoy this but i just did not i can not explain why sometimes cranky writing is warm and endearing and sometimes it is not but something is lacking in this book and while it true that she tracks down such things as bone marrow and squab for authenticity sake she misses another recipe texture completely because she does not have a cooking thermometer surely every grocery store with even a handful of implements for sale offers a cooking thermometer probably for less than the cost of a squab,0
narcissistic hipsters should cook not write after seeing the movie i knew what i was in for when i read the book julia child is a survivor a truly original pioneer of the old school disciplined and humble she is everything that hipster bloggers like the author is not whiny narcissistic entitled yet full of illusions of her own grandeur and hero worshipping of everything vintage and iconic in this case it julia child i was not surprised child responded the way she did who would want to be used as a marketing gimmick and turned into a cultural totem object by a wimpy girl woman who has the life experience of an ameoba julia child must have sensed this and stayed away,0
disappointing i love both cooking and reading blogs so i thought this book would be a natural fit for me unfortunately i did not enjoy much about it the writing is so so and the author deep thoughts that come from her cooking experiences are pretty banal and predictable i did get a laugh that there are book club questions included at the end i can not imagine that any book club would select this book there is just not a lot of substance here i give this one a miss,0
just ok the character was self absorbed past distraction in fact she was so distracted that most of the time she could not get out of her own way and where was she going and why do i want to read about it i also found it difficult relating julia child diary excerpts to the life experiences of julie that they were spliced into if it was not a book club book i would not have finished it,0
horrible recipes made bearable as i am more than halfway through this book i might as well finish julie less than amusing encounters with lobster slaughter for example are rendered with just enough humor to make her tales palatable i forgotten how unbelievably disgusting a great many of julia child recipes were until slogging my way through the diary version of julie life with julia from hoof to flailing claw to beaten lettuce a slight exaggeration but not by much proof that the human species has not advanced all that far on a culinary level if we are supposed to be amused by all this,0
do not waste your money please do not waste your time or money purchasing this book our book club decided to read it based on it good reviews only one person out of six finished it just to get it done the language is foul and the story is boring and drags on which makes it difficult to follow and finish two stars is being generous,0
ick ick ick my book club is reading this book a friend loved it and said it was a quick easy read i hate it hate it hate it and have from the first few pages the main character is boring profane for no apparent reason except lack of class and whines about everything the only thing i have enjoyed is the tiny bit about austin where i grew up i adored julia child who was one of a kind the author should be ashamed using her singular greatness to make money with this crass garbage,0
i bought this for a laugh this is just hilarious mary kate and ashley releasing their greatest hits NUMBER album what could be funnier i do not really know whether to give this one star for musical ability or NUMBER stars for comedy i guess i will just go with one star if you want to laugh but this album,0
must have for newborns this was by far our most useful baby gift it helped our baby get to sleep and even saved our sanity a few times nothing calms a crying newborn better than a good swaddler at first it a little tricky to figure out how the velcro fits together but once you have tried it a few times it easy just buy NUMBER or NUMBER so you will not go into a panic when it in the wash,1
simply put does not work i read dr karp book and decided to buy a swaddling blanket after doing a lot of research and reading a ton of good reviews on this one i decided not to spend the NUMBER shipping on the miracle blanket but get this instead boy was that a bad decision we tried a few times and my baby unswaddled herself within seconds granted we had a big and healthy baby who was strong so maybe if your baby is tiny and or weaker than an average newborn for whatever reason it might work nicely for a while but otherwise do not waste your time with this i ended up buying the miracle blanket and that worked do yourself a favor spend the extra NUMBER and buy the miracle blanket i could have avoided many sleepless nights if i did that earlier,0
not for baby houdinis i was reluctant to invest in a blanket specifically for swaddling but after a few weeks of making due with regular blankets i tried the swaddleme wrap while it is reasonably priced cute and easy to use my little guy found it easy to escape both from the size appropriate blanket and from the smaller size i just could not keep his arms secure or tightly wrapped swaddling at night makes all the difference for my baby so i will continue to do it but i am back to my low tech system receiving blanket and tape,0
worse than a straight jacket my baby hates this even though he loves being swaddled definitely the worst baby product i have purchased,0
helps baby sleep better very nice easy to use highly recommended baby always seemed to manage to escape his blankets this he can not get out of,1
too big blanket was too big in the large size for NUMBER inch baby at NUMBER lbs they have NUMBER sizes but no chart to figure out which size you need the velcro tabs are small and she could easily slip out i am waiting until the baby is bigger to use it but we are in the third month and still waiting other reviews have said the small was too small so i am not sure would recommend miracle blanket costs more but is one size fits all and is adjustable as they grow just do not put it in the dryer,0
ok but there are better swaddlers i have used the small and large size of these swaddlers and would not waste my money again i have to wrap my son so tight for these to work that i will not be using them anymore too many nights he wakes because his hands escape it not worth the disrupted sleep i liked that these were more affordable than the other miracle brand but ended up wasting more money because these did not work for me other swaddling blankets such as the miracle blanket do not solely rely on wrapping tight but also have other tucking aspects that make it effective if you have a houdini baby do not waste your money,0
keep it tight make sure its as tight as possible otherwise the babies head can get inside and the baby could soffocate the back side should be totally covered in velcro so that you can stick the tabs where you need them,0
nice gift this is a very uplifting mix of christmas music if you like celtic music then you will appreciate the various tunes,1
smaller than what it says on the prod description the product came promptly and i like it it was way cheaper than any of the big hardware chains and even one huge lumber and hardware store that caters to contractors item has good weight on it so it does not feel or look cheap one thing i did not like was that it was smaller than what the product description states this is NUMBER inch in diameter not NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER inches other than that i am happy with it,1
oil rubbed door knobs perfect size and color to replace the chrome ones when we did the redecorating in our bathroom lots of browns copper and rust colors perfect,1
look nice they do look like the could cost you alot more but the quality really shows after time the finish does remove from the knob over time but for me it wasnt a big deal since it was for a basement but if you need if for a upscale kitchen i would pass but for a back room or an old drawer its perfect,1
never arrived i ordered this so i could watch it for a paper too bad it never arrived and i had to scramble at last minute to find a copy,0
made in china that says it all dont bother with these rotors they warped after barely NUMBER miles i was assured by powerstop that their products were not from china yet after peeling off a label on the box it was clearly marked made in china so either these are not really from powerstop or i was lied to,0
n g for tivo i agree with other users if you read the tivo recommended wireless network adapters this adapter will not work in tivo because amazon is going to ship you out v NUMBER v NUMBER does not work and v NUMBER is not longer made i suggest you just order the tivo brand that what i did after trying numerous others and yes i have a brand new unit with the latest software that not the issue,0
i do not know if it works worked but a weird deal not sure if my computer was the problem or this thing i can not say it is bad or good sorry,0
does not work and very frustrating it worked at first but the connection kept dropping then every time you try to open the wizard it flashes on the screen for a second and disappears you can not get the wizard to stay on screen for more than a second so can not change any settings a total waste of time and money do not bother with it,0
does not work and merchant will not allow returns this product is horrible we own a belkin and it works unlike this wireless adapter i thought i try this one since it smaller and a bit less money but it does not does not pick up any signal from our modem and the modem is across the hall in the next room in addition i bought it from state street deals and they will not let us return it because it been opened how else would we find out it does not work definitely not a great product or merchant i avoid both at any cost,0
wow what a piece of junk i just spent hours of frustration trying to get this thing to work reliably never got it working correctly netgear will not just let you install the drivers and be done with it no they force you to install their bloated and buggy configuration software which does not play well with windows xp apparently so after much cursing and hair pulling i took it back and exchanged it for a comparable linksys adapter now all is right again in my universe if you are looking for a usb wireless adapter do yourself a favor and go back to the search page and type in l i n k s y s,0
do not waste your money although i am very happy with the other netgear products i own i have to say that this adapter is a waste of money it easy to set up i am running windows NUMBER and starts working at first but after less than a half hour it flickers out and stops working entirely i have a netgear router and laptops using netgear pci wireless cards which work well but this product is a dog i second one of the earlier reviewers who mentioned how hot the item gets after a short time in use my guess is that it has a design flaw that causes it to overheat and stop working they should really go back to the drawing board on this one,0
delicious our shiba inu maya loves these first and foremost the packaging says made in the usa and that makes them worth buying right there they are quite light and airy being freeze dried and are easy to crunch or gum for older dogs a definite go to treat for any canine companion,1
we all love this this is an excellent treat for my cats all natural with only one ingredient i use this to bribe them into letting me brush their teeth it might be pricey but a little goes a long way,1
no mre sequals this movie did not fill it axpectations it was horible i like to see the producers come up with another one how in a million years would peter survive if everyone knows it him he does not have to be a perfect gentlemen but taking off his mask to everyone he meets the whole movie was moronic i would of enjoyed it if that weird gravity thing erased people memory and that auto guy could control his arms after all he was not even evil,0
big fat letdown after the amazing spider man which was full of action adventure and intrigue spider man NUMBER falls flat the commercial and ads make it look like it another spider man but be warned it not the action scenes you see in the commercials are the only scenes with anything interesting shown in them and most of the movie is just peter parker sitting in his aunt house drinking tea and or hanging out with mary jane who has a more boring character than she did in the first one this movie has the audacity to call itself an action movie but it is more of a teen angst drama with one or two scenes of action in fact i do not see why this movie got a pg NUMBER rating for violence it closer to a g this movie is a big letdown after the first one and it will not be on anyone future list of favorites or at least i hope not,0
i wanted to like it i really did i thought it was slow and predictable tobey was good as spiderman but his character seemed a bit whiny and was too much of an idiot i do not get it why everyone likes spiderman so much it not that good of a movie i did not like the first one much either both spiderman movies suck and i hope the NUMBER rd one will be better but it will probably be the same as the first two it in my opinion if i did not like it do not get mad why i did not like it i just did not like it,0
spiderman NUMBER grade a this film is quite possibly the best film sequel ever made it outshines the NUMBER original the action special effects acting story and the villain are all improved the action is this film is heart pumping non stop and fun to watch the special effects have greatly improved over the past three years especially in the aerial shots of new york city the acting in the film is better especially in mary jane character the story is definately improved due to the emphasis on harry osborne hate of spiderman and peter parker having to juggle his life around being a superhero another great aspect of this film is the new villain doc oc this villain you can hate and sympathize with unlike the totally sinister green goblin the film ending sets up perfectly for a third installment to this wonderful film series that will last for generations,1
great movie i thought it was a great movie personally i think it the best out of the three out today,1
marketing really does work i can understand just wanting to watch a trashy action film but this movie was just annoying tobey maguire did his best to convince us that he really is a wet noodle his snivelling self conflicted let me show you my feminine side routine was a bit overplayed for a minute i thought that it was the exact character that he played in cider house somehow i could not help imagining roger ebert with a toothy grin ramming popcorn in his mush while fawning over maguire touching portrayal of a superhero in conflict seriously this was a casting disaster that the marketing department saved a few reviews ago somebody mentioned not seeing enough of maquire body was that a joke after seeing him in this film i am ready to concede that there is a place for steroid use in this world reading these reviews i am suspecting that the production company is paying people to write reviews on amazon,0
smallville anyone i must admit the sequel is bucketloads better than the first that said the rest sucks spiderman is a total copy cat of superman and smallville the villians and the characters are total ripoffs money wasted do yourself a favor and watch a better movie make it superman,0
spider NUMBER strikes gold this movie has an excellent story better than the first first rate acting direction and special effects in my estimation this is better than the first,1
do not listen to the other reviewers it sucked i did not like spiderman NUMBER at all it was like watching a soap opera movie or something with no action in it all there is is just graphics there not any fighting in it doc ock was not a villian at all he was just tryin to go after spiderman for what he did to him and all i do not really see tobey maguire as spiderman that much he just was not right at all kirsten dunst was allright as mj and she georgeous i would not mind having a girl like that james franco would have been a better spiderman than tobey maguire why did they had to choose tobey i hate tobey maguire and all of his movies they suck and he also boring who never says a word but anyways do not waste your money on this movie it very bad that goes along with the first spiderman both spiderman movies suck,0
very awesome NUMBER its full of action adventure and some romance and though i do not like spiders the spider man is kick ass NUMBER,1
awful nearly painful i liked the first movie it was generally hollywood fluff but was interesting enough that i could suspend my disbelief to the point i found it enjoying an acquaintance of mine recently raved about the sequel and between that and the reviews here i was very anxious to see it when my colleague mentioned she had just bought it imagine my surprise when i caught myself watching the clock rolling my eyes and eventually contemplating shutting off the machine during several points in the film kirsten dunst lost whatever acting ability she had shortly after interview with a vampire she does not seem to have the range or depth to portray the complexities of the relationship between m j and parker macguire i guess plays a sadsack to a tee but i do not think i have ever seen him play anything else the one redeeming part of the entire movie is the fight scenes while completely unbelievable the effects are flawless,0
not that good the first spiderman was way better than this garbage the acting was horrible and the action scenes well there were hardly any action scenes this movie sucked there was way too much talking doc oc was horrible he was not even mean do not waste your money,0
good but the first was better spiderman was good but i liked the first spiderman movie a lot more this one was too much of peter parker not having his powers and doing stupid stuff for example why did he keep on taking off his mask the time on the train was understandable because spiderman could not see but the rest of the times were just stupid choices for people to know spidermans identity also why did spiderman keep on losing his powers should not he still have his powers even if he did not want to be spiderman when peter parker got bit by the spider in the first place he did not want powers but he had them anyway now why is he losing them the first one was better but see this one anyway,1
better than the first remarkably entertaining movie i still get chills watching the action sequences on my NUMBER television,1
great price my daughter loves all the spiderman movies and i bought her one through three for christmas can not beat the price,1
best hdmi player best picture quality excellent sound and very good aesthetics price is very low easy to convert to all region,1
build better than expected great product at great price NUMBER NUMBER with free delivery i recently purchased a panasonice upconverting dvd player and although the video remote on that player is great the build quality is sub par compared to this player glad to have this dvd player after having great experience with pioneer laser disc back in the day usb input a huge plus great video do not hesitate,1
would be great if i could watch it never mentioned in the description that this was a pal video from another region than the usa an omission that means a lot i was at this show have seen clips and was looking forward to seeing the entire thing now NUMBER years later be forwarned if you get this and live in america and do not own a multi region player you will be out of luck,0
wilbur smith at his best i bought my first wilbur smith book nov NUMBER it was translated to swedish at that time being NUMBER years old i had not yet started to read in english on a regular basis out of curiosity i counted the books from this author that i had bought over the years and i found to my surprise that i had NUMBER different novels i like all of them if you purchase of prey it is a good introduction to also buy other novels from the same author just a warning do not pick it up and start to read unless you know that you have some time to spare this book will not let you do other things for a while all of his books are entertaining highly interesting and yet educational at the same time the perfect companion to bring when you want to have a quiet moment on your own and relax with a good book,1
excellent reading but not perfect well i have read most of wilburs books at least those on market for the past NUMBER years and this is another good one even though it seems that towards the end wilbur just wanted to finnish the book quickly the details of the first scenes are just not there towards the end as i said it seems like he got bored and just wanted to finnish,1
a trashy macho bodice ripper for guys when i started reading birds of prey i really enjoyed the atmosphere and setting then i started groaning at the incredibly predictable behavior of the cardboard cutout characters by NUMBER NUMBER of the way through i found myself hypnotized by the parade of every stereotypical character i remember from the trashy adventure books i loved when i was NUMBER the young perfect hero his loyal negro sidekick the noble tragic father the backstabbing piratical villain the fat ugly cowardly corrupt rich villain the cruel villain who is however a true warrior the sultry temptress the beautiful imprisoned princess a half dozen more plot elements which i will not reveal for fear of spoiling the book in every way at best an average book,0
fundamentals of management fundamentals of management is a great book to get started in management it covers everything that you would need to know i like this book in particular because it has chapter tests at the end of every chapter so that you can kind of test yourself over what you had just did i also liked how the definitions are out to the side of the reading as well as in bold in the reading it makes it easy to find the words that you are looking for i have learned a lot from this book i went with some experience in managing and still learned something new every time i turned the page i feel this is a great book to get started with in management,1
well organized and easy to understand my husband is using this book for his management class so i am giving you a second hand review i asked him how he liked the book and the title of this review was his response he a man of few words but the bottom line is that he finds the textbook very user friendly and it has benefited him a great deal in his class,1
so cute monogrammed the bedding i picked out did not have a diaper stacker so this one went perfect to tie it in with the bedding i got the top monogrammed it looks so cute very pleased with it,1
follett guide to usage as one who thinks it necessary to own every major english usage manual from fowler on i here state the firm opinion that follett is the best of the reasonably contemporary examples and second only to fowler follett is more erudite more complete not more comprehensive i grant and more analytical than the rest yes bryan this means you for example compare his treatment of the indefensible in terms of to any other someone speaks here of disagreeing with follett remarks on prescriptivism well if you are not a prescriptivist then you ought not be reading usage manuals and if you are one yet still disagree you better find arguments more persuasive than his another critic says follett is not terribly useful as a quickhow to guide well true but the genuine articles never are,1
if you like the classics then why not i read previous reviews of this dvd set and almost did not buy it because of the negative reviews i was basically getting it for free so i figured i might as well i understand where the others are coming from regarding the item being digitally remastered but if you really enjoy the classics then you will love this dvd set my wife i have watched several of the cartoons and they bring back great memories of when we were kids i do not care that it not digitally remastered would it be nice yes but i would not let that stop you from getting this set,1
no classics rip off i bought this expecting to get the classic xmas movies such as frosty the snowman and rudoff the rednose raindeer i was very disappointed to find out neither were included it has such movies as frosty gets married and rudoffs NUMBER th of july all dumb movies made after the original just for money that are not any good it leads you to believe its a bunch of the classics but it is not beware read carefully what you are getting,0
get your money back big disappointment not what is perceived to be by the picture on the box do not order it,0
christmas classics this is a cute classic movie set and each disc has the main feature but then a another movie or two on it as well i knew what i needed to order i borrowed the box set but i broke one disc so i had to replace the whole thing this was the cheapest place i found it the set arrived very quickly thanks,1
clasic christmas favorites the grandkids loved this one not only did they get the favorites but the set included several the family had not seen,1
no little drummer boy NUMBER the trailer on this dvd set has advertisement for little drummer boy NUMBER but this dvd set does not have it instead you get pinnohios christmas do not know why warner did this but thats what is there,0
and i am not a stephen king fan while i do not relish in horror pictures something about the supernatural power of good triumphing over evil fascinates me i have never been into king i do however love this movie and would watch it for years to come it was scary but not as gorry or as bloody as most it was a great mystery that had you going until the very end the best scene was the brother return i cried not of fright but of simple emotion it is a must see even if you are not into the king,1
should become a comedy classic this is cyrano de bergerac updated and told with the craziness of steve martin brain a wonderful funny movie martin is the fire chief of a scenic northwest resort town there are two newcomers to town a professional firefighter rick rossovich and a beautiful female astronomer daryl hannah martin the self assured passionate but ugly that schnoz chief and rossovich the dumb but handsome hunk both fall for hannah of course hannah is interested in the hunk but rossovich is unable to talk to bright women so martin feeds him lines and hannah is swept off her feet the mistaken identity is all worked out satisfactorily by picture end martin wins hannah everything works perfectly in this movie and martin is at his very best i have watched this quite a few times over the years and the humor never gets stale a terrific movie,1
charlie he had very long nose his buddies do not know what to do or put out a fire if they found one her head is in the stars funny movie,1
one good song i like one song on this cd it in the rain is a beautiful song the rest sound like they were rushed to be completed in order to meet the release date i have all of her other cds and i usually enjoy them but this is the first one that i only like one song creatively this one is missing something she also looks silly on the cover so far in NUMBER the only artist to release a completely amazing cd is madonna with confessions on a dance floor maybe enya could call madonna producer she needs a new sound it time to reinvent yourself enya,0
predictable an uninspired enya needs a change or shes going to end up like the new age version of madonna her fans who follow her blindly will always give her good reviews but this cd is enyas worst not one song on this cd remotely began to move me inside the whole cd is luke warm while trying to be overly sentimental reminding me of madonna once again i could try to find a soung to recommend for download but i can not even do that enya is slowing slipping into the void where once good artists who fail to change end up madonna enigma and now enya,0
a long wait for enh yuk now before you other enya fans go into defense mode i want to say i really like her stuff and have been a fan of hers for many years that being said this album is a bit of a letdown after such a long wait okay a lot of a letdown it well boring it lacks the intricate construction memorable melodies and harmonies that earlier albums and tracks have take to go beyond ii it has almost a fairytale magical sound to it china roses it has beautiful harmonies and softness in it that delight the ears long boats has a feeling of power and strength in it sadly amarantine has none of that we all know enya can do much better hopefully in the not too distant future she will cut a new cd where her magic will return,0
you lose all cred ripping someone a new when you can not spell and make grammatical errors i am a little tired of hearing is just the same as blah blah song album and it horrible boring i love ebadue and africa i and ii so i am elated that river sings has a similar feel i think it an amazing song and my favorite on the album and said good bye remind me of the vocal songs from day without rain i never much cared for the songs with words before wild child lazy days etc which are among my favorites from all of her works than a pearl is hauntingly beautiful and is also very pretty i have always enjoyed listening to any of enya albums to relax from a long day at work for yoga and meditation this album will definitely go into that mix the above mentioned songs will also go on my own of cd,1
a soothing voice in a chaotic world if there is one musical constant in a world of chaos it is the soothing voice and melodic songs of enya i love her and her music her voice music and her very being are inexorably intertwined giving us a feeling of warmth and passion in our hearts that i can not find the words to describe how can i describe exactly how lovingly she finds the beauty that is still in our world a beauty that each of us carries inside like a piece of some great cosmic puzzle that only has to be realized perhaps long in coming but i love the wait and savor the moment and here is amarantine i truly love every track but there seems to be a special place for it in the rain for me i have said what i have tried to put into words i just love her music,1
amarantine more of the good same if you like enya and you have them all then by all means get this album amarantine is beautiful it of the same timber as the rest of enya albums in honesty if you find a bit of sameness troublesome then perhaps this album is not for you there are some variations the river sings has great bounce if i need to find a criticism then i felt that it in the rain was a little stilted but only a little i will put all of enya cd on shuffle play that NUMBER hours of music and sit down happy as a clam with a good book amarantine is a good addition to enya discography okay i do not know what a clam would do with a good book but i am sure it would be happy,1
whyte weaves wonders a friend florida condo is as unlikely a setting to begin whyte camulod chronicles as one can imagine but from the first page i was there in the farthest reaches of the roman empire before the fall now with the sorcerer metamorphosis whyte weaved a magical NUMBER dimensional tapestry of the birth of nations and arthur britain from the failures of an empire the series is amazing and thank all that good a venue for a great mind thank you mr whyte,1
worth every penny what can i say the chapter on setting up your jointer is worth the price of the book by itself the pictures and the diagrams are great easy to understand and the text is informative and easy to read this book makes you a better woodworker because your tools will be correctly set up which also makes them more fun to use and much safer i would recommend this book to you even if you do not own the tool but are looking at getting into woodworking with this book you will be better able to understand how the various tools work and you can buy decent used tools and tune them up saving you a bundle great book,1
this does not do rage credit the cd is a disgrace i almost laughed out lad at the singers voice if you are in need of a few laughs then buy this if you like music by any rage album this cd does not deserve a star the music does not compare to rage at all,0
looking backward i have a bad habit of diving into major events years after they occurred i did not understand enron worth spit when it happened and after reading this book though the information is useless i am conversant in the collapse and picked up some insight about how stupid privately run utilities truly are nothing so essential should be left to crafty traders,1
boring boring boring some have called this book a basic guide for the enron mess i would call it a basic guide for falling asleep i worked at enron and there is nothing more annoying than self proclaimed experts trying to explain the ins and outs of a company from the outside it about as accurate and useful as a binder ful of news clippings this book fails to capture the spirit of enron and fails to capture the essence of what really went wrong i hope some better books come along because the quick and dirty paperback version here was a waste of time and money,0
very informative and helpful for anyone who searches to resolve the mysterious of stuttering this is a must read bob has certainly discovered and reveals much of the mystery,1
larry garfield is compared to when danny devito plays larry garfield he is like taxi louie de palma of wall street,0
great speech by larry at the end not a bad movie not great but better than average until the shareholder meeting at the end however the speech that larry the liquidator danny devito gives at the meeting is great larry explains very clearly why corporate takeovers are not a bad thing and even why liquidation of an underperforming business is good his speech ranks right up there with francisco speech in ayn rand atlas shrugged,1
love having a female hero my two and a half year old does not watch much tv but she loves jane and the dragon on saturdays she also likes jacob two two and we have ordered those books as well she was very excited when she saw the books as well in a time when tv execs could not allow dora to be on top by giving diego his own show it is nice to have a female lead that is strong and brave but also sometimes makes mistakes and learns from them the stories are interesting enough for older kids too,1
saw the tv show read the book if you have seen the wonderful jane and the dragon tv series you will enjoy the book you hear the basic story in the theme song and wonder how jane and her dragon met and what made the king let her train to be a knight this book tells that story it is an enjoyable story that engages everyone from children to adults i highly recommend this book,1
great transmitter but not universal i ordered this expecting it to come with a NUMBER NUMBER mm connection but came with a different connection although it says designed for zune the pictures are misleading so if your looking for a universal transmitter make sure it is in fact universal this transmitter is great rarely get static and its stereo so thats a plus,1
can not rate do not work i can not write a review because the dvd does not work when i put it in my dvd player terrible shame do not know why everything else works but this frankie johnny dvd,0
read carefully before you purchase from amazon see below comments i was upset with this amazon purchase because when i played the movie frankie johnny michele pfeiffer al pacino it said this disc may not be played in your region little did i know that the movie i purchased was in swedish how could that happen can you tell me amazon where i can purchase this movie in english i do not need to review the movie because i have seen it before and loved it that is why i wanted to purchase it so i could watch it again and loan it to friends it was not a big hit movie and it is very hard to find it is a movie from the NUMBER beware amazon purchasers read carefully before you purchase read the fine print patricia,0
it good not great about right for the price this sharpener is good not great but probably right for the price i sharpened a bunch of pencils in a row we homeschool and it ran smoothly about NUMBER of the time there were a few clunky starts nothing dramatic but not perfect also and this is the reason for the lack of stars the drawer is a bit of a pain when you sharpen of course there are shavings in the small drawer which is accessible right on the front below the hole well when you go to put the drawer back in it a tiny bit of a struggle there is a small plastic tube or offshoot in the back of the drawer and you have to line it up with a hole inside the machine because the drawer is a rather cheap plastic as is the tube offshoot i had the feeling it would break if i let my kids use it decent length cord about as noisy as any x acto electric sharpener,1
do not waste your money i bought this sharpener for my kids to use at home we tried it a couple of times but it never sharpened a pencil evenly wood all up one side so you can not write with it it is really noisy and vibrates a lot it really feels like a bargain basement electric sharpener i returned it and bought a westcott ipoint electric pencil sharpener which works so much better and is far less noisy,0
does not work this sharpener did not work from the first time i attempted to use it it only hummed when a pencil was inserted into the sharpener it seems like the motor is bad or just too weak i m sending it back i do not recomend this item,0
disapointing i ordered the boston pencil sharpener and was sent the x acto sharpener i do not like it my round pencils get stuck the opening is not quite big enough it is very noisy and it does not sharpen evenly i sharpened three pencils and will return it very disapointing to get a different product than ordered,0
it works all i needed was something to sharpen pencils with we always get those cheap sharpeners that cost NUMBER cents at walmart no good this is perfect,1
a reading escape i want a novel that is well written a book with story plot and characters that live and breathe a book that for a few hours i can relax lose myself kick back and enjoy reading quiet desperation is such a book and for me is the reason i love to read i look forward to more advertures from tuck matson and more books from mr smeraglia,1
a knockout ride of a thriller jeff fahey life goes to hell when he receives an arm transplant after an auto accident turns out the arm came from a serial killer written and directed by genre favorite eric red body parts is mostly superior entertainment from beginning to end fast paced with several exciting action sequences the pseudo car chase and hospital finale come to mind and a decent mystery make certain the movie never lets up drags a few times in the beginning and the story gets maybe a little too silly but this is overall a gripping horror thriller fahey is superb as is brad dourif as an eccentric painter NUMBER NUMBER out of,1

reference quality blu ray picture this picture transfer on blu ray is definitely reference quality and worth bragging about and showing off to your hi def junkie friends i can not comment on the lossless audio quality since i can not decode quite yet this is a must have for any blu ray collection,1
a movie that as it all before i first watched i robot i was afraid it might have sold out as an action film thankfully i was wrong i robot contained an even balance of not only action but psychology sociolgy philosophy the clash of logic and emotions life and unconditional love the movie made you think and feel with its knowledge although its visuals and sounds were equally appealing with another nice balance of the present and the movie version of the future such a natural feeling is rare in action films which helped the mind to agree that it is believable if you watch this movie watch it not only for its action but its beautiful philosophies it can make anyone think or if you do not like to think enjoy the action and seeing will smith naked in the shower unless you do not swing that way,1
a surprisingly good adaptation loosely based upon isaac asimov story will smith i robot is good i rarely have anything good to say about such adaptations but this detective story set in a future in which robots are commonplace is well done and gripping although i think the key plotline of following breadcrumbs or deliberately set clues could have been done better the special effects are for the most part impressive and believable the acting was good and i was pleased to watch it,1
not asimov material smith has shown once again that he can only play one role that of a disrespectful punk who grates on everyone nerves asimov is probably rolling around in his grave right now the special effects were good but the acting was not chi mcbride was great and bridget moynihan did well but smith just reinforced the fact that he can not handle any role that does not exactly reflect his own personality and demeanor i hope that some director in the future tries to cast smith in a role that was not written for him then we will all see that he really can not act his way out of a wet paper bag do not buy this on dvd wait for it to come out on one of the cable movie channels,0
oh how stupid can they be well a lot more than a lot poor will does his best with a doggie script he accounts for the one star i do not know why those enlightened movie companies insist in making one sf dog after another did you watch the the chronicles of riddick sky captain or avp there are plenty of others around all of them sucking money out of our pockets they need to fool us in order to pay for the great cgi effects i suppose they fail to understand that if cgi is used to generate profits it will kill the emotional content of the movie what left is the customary hollywood pablum dulling our senses do not relate this dog to any of isaac asimov works they stole the title and we shall punish them by forgetting this miserable mutt,0
i robot loved this movie would have given it five stars if there had been a little romance thrown in it was very good even so,1
review is specific for this combo pack more than the movie i ordered the NUMBER d bluray combo pack for the action graphics it a typical will smith big budget action movie so if you like those you will like this i do not post many reviews but i wanted to on this NUMBER d bluray pack because the NUMBER d disc does not play on my vizio NUMBER d bluray player the disc acts like it is going to load and then just ejects i ordered it a second time thinking that i had received a defective disc the first time i was wrong the second one did the exact same thing save your time and money and order a normal dvd,0
not even the same story as the book the story is totally different than the book all they took was the name and a couple of the characters the story was pretty much a rip off of the terminator just think about it what is this thing next to the what who did this and why,0
ugh what a travesty that this book was published drag drag drag i kept reading for two reasons the first i had nothing better to do one sunday and the second i kept hoping something significant would happen it did not this story had no climax no capture no passion who wants to read about the somber day to day lives of boring spinsters of course i did what a waste alice hoffman is off my reading list her use of profanity was unwarranted and did not emphasize meaning in anything her characters were flat and the overall flow was slow if not stagnant the ending was short and curt as if she was just as bored writing it as it was to read unremarkable,0
maybe NUMBER and NUMBER NUMBER stars i picked this book up expecting to get lost in a magical world maybe something like harry potter but this book failed to deliver on that front the magic was underhanded and unorganized however with that said this was still a good read examining the dynamics between two generations of sisters was interesting and the writing moved along comfortably overall it worth reading but do not expect to be mesmerized,1
terrific the book was great i have already recommended it to friends of mine i would definitely read it again and again,1
a peppy lil guy that gets the job done highs suction bare floor cleaning retractable cord quietness ease of uselows tips easily not great for carpets bag capacityverdict a good little helper on hard surfaces but not ment for carpeted areas,1
for those who like intellectual jibberish if you liked high school poetry class you might like this movie both my wife and i hated it because the teachers always seemed to find some meaning in a poem that completely mystified us i thought this movie was going to be a search for the missing sixteen year old sister of the main character if she found out what happened it must have been hidden just like those esoteric our teachers found in the poems they assigned i thought the movie was still setting the background when it suddenly ended what it was all about i have no idea this is a movie for those who like to spout intellectual jibberish and think it means something or maybe you have to be on some kind of illegal drug to make any sense of this movie,0
after all it is poe great reading year after year his works endure wish i had had the opportunity to meet him in person no i will haveto wait until the afterlife hope we both end up in the same place,1
lullabies to paralyze well as this album leads from songs for the deaf i also have to say this is a really good album long slow goodbye little sister and in my head are really good songs and someone in the wolf another song on the album is good and practically every song is pretty good i would say the worst song s are broken box and you got a killer scene there man well let us see what our surprise is on the next album,1
flummery surely dear reader this book must be a parody of austen and trollope but one turns the pages with an uneasy consciousness that one has not been let in on the joke,0

my mistake i bought this to replace the that my dog loved and we lost in the woods i was excited about the when it arrived it is tiny my mistake as it clearly states it is for small dog my NUMBER lab does love it still i wish the came in a size for a large dog overall it is a sturdy toy my dog can break any squeaker but he does not destroy these very strong sturdy,1
nice to share i do not like to journal because of the big blank page staring up at me this is a great compromise because the space for gratitude is not vast my sister and sister in law were pleased to receive the journal as gifts too,1
great little journal received this as a christmas gift from a dear friend and i just love it keeps me in the moment and helps me remember all the wonderful things to be grateful for each day,1
this is great this journal allows you to highlight the good things in your life it makes you think of the positive rather than the negative it is a must have,1
excellent adventure but way bogus journey this movie was nowhere near the original so should you wish to watch it do not expect to be in stitches the whole time i honestly like it less and less each time i watch it which to me is a mark of a bad movie it does have it moments hence the NUMBER stars it is after all bill and ted it has to have moments my suggestion is rent borrow it before purchasing it if you love it buy it if not do not,0
bogus package labeled correctly whole family loved the first when viewed in NUMBER it is aging well this one is not aging well too many things are too bogus to keep the story line going the scene with the reaper challenge is the only redeeming scene and even that one is slower than most scenes in today comedies only watch if you are a bill and ted historian,0
worst freaking movie ever freakiing created although i do agree with all the reviews below mine i would have to say this movie freaking sucked it is the abomination of the movie world it should have never been created i got this in my cereal box yep i was pouring my fruity lucks when this dvd popped into my cerial bowl i tryed biting it to see if it was candy but to no avail it was actually the dvd i was so disappointed i decide to watch it i thought i might get a good laugh out of how corny and cheesey mmm cheese i want popcorn the movie actually scared me and i had to go to the store to buy beer and asprin i then went to a party and talked about how bad this movie was then i talked to alpha NUMBER about it i could not believe that there was a movie with russel crowe in it where he was not yelling anyway i liked the part in the movie where they died that was the only funny part and they should have ended it there good night everybody,0
funny funny funny bill ted are killed by robot us es they were sent from the future to prevent the birth of wyld stalions bill ted must now challenge death escape the afterlife to set things right side splitting fun recommended,1

way too small for anything but the camera if you bought a camera and you want somewhere to keep all your stuff nothing outrageous but things like cords a couple of cds maybe a wireless mic this is not your bag it will carry only your camera no extra stuff buy this to carry your stuff and you will still be relegated to carrying the rest of your items around in a plastic grocery sack,0
did not live up to expectations getting the book i thought it change my life through all the insight sennett would bestow on me sadly not the case it was a lackluster title i do not really have any suggestions as to what might be better,0
long and allegorical too long may sound good if you do not know your bible or biblical history the world will not end on NUMBER either,0
any fan will be happy i did have some concern from other reviews that mentioned the lackluster sound quality i am very picky about my sound but the price made me do it and i am happy i did this cd had all the songs i needed to fill out my collection the quality was not an issue at all this is well worth the money you will not be disappointed this is a perfect addition to that ewf fan that wanted to grab a few songs on itunes you can get this cd have everything you needed and more for the cost of a few songs on itunes,1
what up w jarrett this is a great album of atmospheric moody music gary bass sounds great and he plays well throughout jack accents the mood and only really opens up on the last two tracks i would consider this one of my all time favorites if not for one thing keith jarrett moaning and whining i can not understand it his playing is so beautiful and lyrical all overlaped w these strange and annoying noises i know it is an expression of emotion while playing but i find it highly destracting this album though is good enough to look past it barely,1
nice supplement to study meisner work nice explanations as to why you learn the words in the way that you do and all books in this series include notebook client pages for you to take notes or practice the exercises i liked the fact that he included questions of the class and his answers to those questions,1
a way to understand the language of film as a college film instructor i find persona a wonderful text for students to begin to understand the ways film language operates with it the critical viewer can surpass content based approaches to film and begin to understand the way film communicates visually not only do i find the film valuable for my students but myself as well i love to watch it and unravel its complex and compelling messages in approaching such a bold and innovative work i find much of what i love in movies that experience is beautiful persona is one of the few films which can do that for me as well as it does,1

works great most panasonic cameras have a pretty good battery life unless you shoot a lot of pictures or use the flash a lot in that case you will need another battery and this is a good choice,1
bleh well they do not taste like anything and they are really hard to bite into not crispy just really hard if you are a sailor from the eighteenth to ninteenth century and you are used to ship biscuit then i am sure you will love these as they have got more protein and better taste and are also in nice sealed packages no weavils they remind me of woody allen line i could make a lot of money selling these in a health food store i went for these because of all the rave reviews and i am now dissapointed i guess i can feed these to my boyfriend he might eat them if he really hungry and there nothing else,0
nice album for the sad times hefner is really awesome if you listen love will destroy us in the end you may find the most sensitive yet funny song of the album and it quite surprising that a band can do that without using epic arrangements with horns and all that stuff i recommend this album because no one has this one and i love to talk about it with anyone,1
do not buy this edition please do not buy this edition it is poorly edited and full of typos and errors get the penguin edition instead,0
good movie terrible dvd i have no problems with the movie but technically the quality of this disc is beyond terrible it looks like a youtube video does when you play it on a NUMBER inch plasma only worse compression artifacts tiling with squares the size of post it notes banding that looks like NUMBER bit grayscale it made the whole thing unwatchable for me,0
defective product i ordered and had to return two separate copies of this dvd because of wavy lines in the picture on both copies,0
detour made by a poverty row studio in just six days this cynical acid tongued noir exemplified what a skilled director like ulmer could do on a shoestring budget narrated by neal whose weary voice is that of a man recounting a terrible nightmare detour wallows in grim fatalism and sports a wildly venomous turn by savage as the castrating vixen who blackmails al into a seedy get rich scheme crisp pacing rabid dialogue and on the fly camerawork make this disturbing and fascinating detour well worth taking,1
great book wonderful book if you want to know more about the practices of the samurai i bought this for my boyfriend and he found it very useful,1
path to integrity this work is from the memoirs of an enlightened soul written some NUMBER years ago still applies to every day life in the NUMBER st century better than any self help book on the market it a self help guide to peace integrity and enlightenment of our soul seen through eyes of a free spirit indentured to service living by a code,1
insight into the spiritual ideals of the samurai the translation may be a little enigmatic at times but the core of the material is extraordinary as a historical document it reflects on the ideals that defined the samurai spirit and laments the loss of this selfless nature,1
love this mat this mat is perfect for me the NUMBER mm thickness provides the cushion that i need for my ankles back and knees i also love that it is decomposable recyclable does not absorb moisture is toxic free hypoallergenic and wipes clean with a mild solution of soap and water very much worth the price,1
best value for the easy to put together came with very good and clearcut instructions you have to have a good amount of floor space for it to turn though other than that it is a super buy,1
one sided and incomplete one can go on forever about who is pro this or pro that but the truth is that the most complete and recognized book on the subject of the liberty is written by jay cristol a united states judge who has devoted his life to the facts of what went on that day this book shows one side from an emotional person who was hurt and angry if you read this book you do yourself and history a disservice if you do not read jay cristol book as well i was horrified by the incident as any american would be until i read the explanations and facts addressed by judge cristol seemingly impossible facts to refute mentioned in this book have complicated but indisputable answers a country fighting for its life does not brutally attack its only ally in the world there are answers and this book does not have them judge cristol book does,0
i bought it by mistake first let me say that i ordered this movie by mistake i wanted to order more movies but i got this instead how are you supposed to get the movies you want now i have the movie i want so i watch it it is called theworld nuttiest nutcracker which is why i bought this moviebecause it about world records for who is the nuttiest of all let me repeat that i hate cchristmass but i love movies about christmass i do not have to deal with my own family because i hate them so now i watch this movie and i like it like NUMBER stars out of NUMBER it is insane there are all these people in the moviethat look like cheap plastic but wait they are not real they are realtime NUMBER d people fruit so that caught my eye and i loved the fact that this was a good choice to buy and then watch thisawfull film,1
not so great i purchased this video in a bookstore on cape cod last summer and was disapointed though i admit no video or photograph can match the beauty of the cape that i know this video is both dated and technically rough around the edges the content was a little superficial as well sorry if this sounds superficial but hopefully they will update it,0
touching tale of committment and love a young boy opts to adopt an abused and neglected dog in need of a home rather than raise a coveted purebreed pup and learns that hard earned love is sometimes the sweetest to receive ukrainian artist katya krenina illustrations are delightful and lisa mccourt tale of a boy and his dog seemed particularly relevant to our family own adoption story,1
on time and new as described reasonably priced and shipped on schedule valves and membranes were new and in packaging as described pricing is very competitive and purchasing was easy,1
no accolades here i threw this book in the trash i was so very disappointed characters are flat story lines are absurd why would i be interested in a stepmother sleeping with her stepson after the funeral of her husband all of you who seem to love this author switch to elizabeth berg superior author and stories with depth,0
unique subject matter come to me is a book of short stories each one dealing with outrageous extraodinary unimaginable subject matter such as love is not a pie about a husband and wife who bring another man into their bed or sleepwalking a stepmother seduces her stepson naughty silver water a tearjerker about a girl remembering her and suicide only you a bored housewife who falls head over heals with her hairdresser who happens to be a transvestite my favorite phychoanalysis changed my life a very smart therapist has a plan to set her son up with a patient unexpected and colorful if you are seaching for skillful writing unique metaphor truth and the element of uncut surprise this is definitely the book for you note even though i did not agree with some of the subject matter i found myself identifying with the characters,1
poor a very poor book do not bother from the title you think the book has interesting information from high level commanders it does not it mostly just a bunch of ramblings often contradictory the chapter on finland maybe would rate three stars i think the only useful information in the whole book otherwise was the information on the number of snow plows per mile that were needed to keep roads clear if you are looking for any other logistical info forget it the description of the book is highly misleading and i regret having bought it,0
neither savage or sensuous i must admit that the title caught my attention sad to say the music will not it reminded me of being in a department store elevator stuck in the mezzanine and unable to get out you can save yourself if you want good exotica buy a les baxter cd,0
greek this was not a very good movie nor well acted anthony quinn always play good movies but this one was just o k,0

college book thank you for sending the book fast so that i could start reading it for my college class,0
run a full size smaller but toasty warm i have several other pairs of slippers for winter and these are my absolute favorite they are so warm and comfortable my only two complaints though are that i like to see a more supportive footbed also they do run a full size too small so be sure to order one size up i did so at the recommendation of the other reviewers and they were right the sole of the slipper is also non slip,1
do not order these i received mine yesterday and returned them today the uppers are glued to the sole in a haphazard fashion once you put them on you can feel the edges where the uppers are glued and clipped on the inside i doubt they would last long glue is not the way to go they should be stitched shoddy workmanship all the way around i am sorry i paid for the shipping to get them and the shipping to send them back all in all NUMBER to find out they were shoddy never again,0
warm but less than perfect shearling is the best slipper material i have ever tried so i have owned a number of shearling slippers the sole of these is not as cushy as others i have had and they do not feel quite as snug which makes slippers snuggly having a non shearling outer sole as these do is key for any sort of durability not a bad buy at the price but there a little compromise,1
good christmas present my wife asked for slippers to replace some old warn ones i given her years before at that point the mall was beyond crowded so i went online after browsing for what seemed a long time i am a guy i hate to shop i found several and finally narrowed it down to this she loves them and for a color challenged guy i even picked the right color they are great,1
almost a whole size too small i bought these last year and tried them on too small but i thought perhaps they stretch out a bit wrong i have been wearing them now still almost new for a month now w no luck on any stretching my toes are smushed all the way to the end and they hurt i even have a narrow foot for what it worth not that the width would affect much still bummer,0
great for the price i bought these when they were deal of the day for around NUMBER can not complain about a deal like that in response to the reviewers who said to order a size up i say maybe order up a half size if you like your slippers fairly loose when i first got mine i thought they would be too small but after wearing them a couple of days they stretch out and i think they run pretty tru to size i would not pay NUMBER for them but if i see them for deal of the day again i will be buying them for all my family,1
fixed more than our table issues no doubt we brought this baby home expecting the most boy did we get it it was one of those nights clarance and arnold are on their way six others were expected i had an amazing recipe from marie curie spanish salad and ken had squeezed the juice clean from the cranberry we threw the table together and after some simple instructions and not less than two stubbed thumbs we were in biz i would decide to tell anyone that this tool really has something for everyone pleased customer,1
widge i like this product when using my bosch combo kit on my router table this base allows me to adjust the router bit height from above the router table by using the included hex key in additon i can leave this base permanently attached to the router table i simply pull the motor out of the base that attached to the router table and then stick it into one of the other router bases when i want to use the router freehand very convenient,1
bad product this product really sticks i bought a couple days ago and then had to return it i could not even set up the vnp because there was no proper documentation i call netgear and their support was no help at all the router could not work wirelessly and wired simultaneously for the same machine without reset the router what i am trying to say is if you connected wirelessly to the router and then disconnected that wireless connection and then plugged into the router with your wired lan cable you would not have a connection unless you went into the the router wirelessly and resetted it manaully the latest firmware upgrade they have for the router is a beta v NUMBER NUMBER and if you have a a problem with beta versions of their firmware you can not call them netgear you have to email EMAIL or something like that it does have alot of cool features but there are too many glitches hope this review helps,0
decent products awful technical support i have had a variety of netgear products over the last NUMBER years i have generally been pleased w features and functionality up until recently i have never had to draw on netgear tech support however after a year of working fine one of my firewall routers went kerplunk all the signs point to a hardware problem so i contacted tech support realizing that i have to go through the usual rigamorole sp to get an rma however despite a very detailed email description of the problems and the various things i did to try and fix them firmware upgrades reinstalls hardware resets etc the tech who answered me told me i have to contact them through telephone support currently NUMBER NUMBER pm eastern time NUMBER july NUMBER wait times for tech support are in excess of NUMBER minutes that unacceptable if you are lucky enough to never need tech support or to have an item repaired replaced then netgear is a fine option otherwise buyer beware,0
waste of time viewed NUMBER NUMBER rate NUMBER NUMBER zzzzz watching the addams family is like pouring nitric acid on my brain i hate all of the characters and it gets ever annoying to watch gomez to be fancy and exciting doing things it like can the nightmare end even though it is a NUMBER minute flick the addams family is just too long to sit through the plot is idiotic and the whole time i am wondering why could not they have electrocuted fester in hopes of kicking his amnesia over i am surprised that despite the fact that everybody in the family likes dark incidents and so so nobody was abusing drugs wake me up when somebody hires thing for a job like he has a social security number did the film really start the gothic trend where stupid kids in high school were dressing up all in black and pretending to have mental and emotional problems all in all the addams family is a terrible piece of rubbish that manages to make time to crawl very slowly,0
great look at the feastival i thought this was a great book especially for someone just learning about this like me the writing is easy to get into in some cases a bit too cutsy i am afraid but i looked past that i enjoyed the section on the history of halloween across cultures although in some ways it seemed like too much of a high level synopsis but it was an ok introduction the section on halloween symbols was excellent since we see all these things typically at halloween black cats witch hats etc there are some fun divinations which include runes and there are of course blessings and recipes etc i think this would be a great family book to give kids all of us really a bit more meaning to the day rather than just getting a stash of candy from the neighbors definitely a great introduction and fun stuff to do i am giving it NUMBER stars rather than NUMBER since i was expecting a bit more substance but its fun nonetheless,1
loved this book really opened my eyes on the myths misconceptions and superstitions silver made me smile more than once i plan on reading it again very informative also recommended reading is silver to stir a magick cauldron and to ride a silver broomstick check out author yasmine galenorn also,1
box of hair i heard that cub broke up if it true it truly tragic cub are a female trio from the great white north who specialize in sugary sweet pop gems with a very little bit of a country feel sometimes they remind me of the fastbacks they play clean with little or no distortion make good use of light hearted humor the last NUMBER tracks riverside not what you think live show that they can do much more than the seemingly empty cutsie pop songs their pop songs however are not as vacuous as they may appear to be on the surface they are smart creative heart warming i do not know if this is cub best album because they are all so good but i do know that if bands like heavenly go sailor butterglory make you happy then so will cub,1
poor performance this brand was my NUMBER nd delonghi thermal carafe model in NUMBER months after the first one broke after NUMBER weeks this one worked wonderfully for about NUMBER weeks until one morning i came in and found coffee all over the counter i thought i had not aligned the pot properly or something after another week of dealing with this the electrical system shorted out due to all the coffee spills this coffee maker made the best coffee and the carafe kept it hot all day i do not know what happened and we could not get it resolved we purchased a cuisinart with a NUMBER yr warranty not the one that grinds coffee and has worked great for NUMBER weeks,0
terrible packaging the kit came in one of those treacherous plastic molded shells designed to hang on a store display it took almost NUMBER minutes and several bloody fingers to access the contents of course the picture on the amazon website does not show this egregious over packaging,0
stupid amazon return policy amazon will not take back the item even if it is unopened even if i pay for return shipment what a second rate retailer,0

alan moore writing for comics i wanted more of a how to book on comic writing concerning breaking in making contacts etc too much drawing plot comparisons and witty talk it a small enough book to skim through and i did not find what i was looking for maybe it helps out the aleady established comic writer but for those of us who have yet to make it nah,0
how to create comics from the man who changed them alan moore work is among the most influential in the comics field this essay which is bound in a comic style format is short but gets the creative juices going he shares some useful insight into storycraft and framing plots for the comics medium i do not write comics prose fiction is my area but i dound this insightful and inspiring if you like his work in watchmen and swamp thing this is definitely worth picking up and it is very very cheap,1

great so where is it now if you like seal and his passionate powerful voice then this abreviated release is a must have stripped of all the production effects these raw versions of some of seal best songs show seal for the artist he is and they really highlight the emotional power of his voice the huge problem is you can not find this release anywhere anymore that a true disservice to seal and his fans,1
title is misleading you would think that a dvd with an alluring girl on the cover and had the word sex in the title would well have sex in the actual movie but you be completely wrong if you bought phone sex fantasies because there is no sex real or simulated in the entire dvd basically the girls talk dirty sorta and then take off their clothes that it,0
olivia the vocalist while promoting this album in NUMBER olivia appeared on a tv show with dionne warwick during the show dionne said how olivia voice could be defined clear as crystal and that exactly what this cd showcases olivia newton john crystal clear voice hitting wonderful high notes in such a soft way olivia delivers standards such as over the rainbow or reach out for me with that special quality that makes her so unique my favorite tracks on this are by far you will never walk alone and when you wish upon a star these always give me goosebumps originally intended for her then NUMBER year old daughter this cd is a perfect gift for moms to be or just simply a wonderful gift either for yourself or for someone else,1
just plane bad cap when i received this cap i thought i was getting a letter the cap was crammed into a flat envelope terrible quality very flimsy brim awful item i do not know where the positive reviews came from this is a cap i will never wear in fact it went from the envelope it came from straight into the trash where it belongs very bad buying experience would not ever buy from this seller again this is not a military cap it a crap cap made in china,0
best data NUMBER k usb modem macintosh as other reveiwers noted this modem can not stay connected you can reestablish connection by unplugging and plugging the usb but this is a pain instructions that come with modem are incomplete and do not give information about lights also best data tech support does not respond there are bound to be better choices,0

they work i have tried every ice pack on the market the ace ones are great but every single one leak no matter how careful i am with them they leak at the seams these are less expensive and with proper care last forever when using them cold you do need a cover of some sort an old pillow case works well folded over several times plus the size works well big enough to sit on your head for those migraines without falling off easily sometimes holding your head still to keep the ice pack on ends up hurting your neck which makes your head worse defeats the purpose for the money this one is a good choice,1

fair towards midland this book is typical of its genre it relies heavily on snorre sturlusson prose edda which is one of the clearest sources on nordic mythology it must also be kept in mind that snorre was writing several hundred years post heathen and was also highly influenced by classical forms of mythological models in short snorre work reads like greek myth with nordic characters not to mention that he was not writing a handbook on heathen belief he was writing a handbook on poetry particularly skaldic metric form and added the myth parts for reference snorre work is useful as a secondary reference at best and if snorre got it wrong and a book this one is based on snorres works well you get the picture,0
this light absolutely sucks do not waste time or money on this garbage you can not mount it and the replacement battery is very expensive useless,0

and most important my wife likes it i was not sure if i wanted a rocker or a fixed recliner for my outdoor porch i came across this glider by accident and at first dismissed it i remember as a kid seeing gliders made of metal with springs that groaned and made up of fused together rust after reading other reviews and taking a chance i bought it it went together easily enough except for one locking bolt that did not line up i had read another reviewers suggestion that i keep a drill handy and with that and a little persuasion it came together fine even though the wood was treated at the factory i live in florida where everything gets old before it time so i gave it a treatment with teak oil it looks great feels solid and is very comfortable great buy for the price,1
a word of warning to jazz fans this album has british saxophonist courtney pine really coasting smooth mellow with a predominance of synthesisers drum programming with no real blowing or hard edges very very reminiscent of kenny g with some synthesised reggae inflections also some rather schmaltzy vocal work if you like that sort of thing fine but in my humble opinion smooth jazz like this just is not worth the time or money given the abundance of truly high quality inventive jazz available,0
x pulse get your heatbeat pounding with the newest expansion to the popular mechwarrior NUMBER vengeance with the addition of new mechs like the sunder wolfhound uller and more you will be able to trade on the black market for new weapons and mech chassis i highly recommend this game as a sysop with the microsoft gaming zone play it online with up to NUMBER other people for the ultimate players experience,1

do not buy do not buy i read a lot of negative reviews about the purchase of high end expensive perfumes at amazon website however since this one was being sold by amazon com itself i decided to take a risk i am extremely disappointed with this purchase the fragrance is so subtle that even a person standing one foot away can not appreciate it and that is immediately after putting it on complete waste of money,0

last recordng by the best sax player of his generation the best sax player of his generation joined by one of the best pianists ever this is getz last recording and some of his solos are almost unbearably sad his lyrical inventiveness was never greater though getz does not embellish the original melody in his solos he makes comletely new ones of even greater beauty here they are often plaintive and full of pain jazz artists rarely display this sort of emotional openess but getz technnical skills and romantic imagination turn all this into high art barron of course is simply the best jazz pianist around together they have produced a truly great album,1
love it i got this as a used product and got a good deal for it the movie plays as good as new i like the whimsicalnature of this movie,1
unbalanced this is an unbalanced view of the so called aids epidemic in south africa thabo mbeki put his reputation on the line to challenge the aids orthodoxy for his reactionary intransigence he is marked with pejorative epithets like denialist he is vilified and demonized he refuses to accept that the health of south africans is declining because of their sexual behaviour not poverty and underdevelopment he opposes pushing toxic drugs on pregnant woman and their babies this honest and hard working leader deserves recognition there are fair and balanced books on the south african aids epidemic this book is not among them errare humanum est sed diabolicum perseverare,0
these are gorgeous i would expect to pay NUMBER times more for these lovely earrings in a boutique shop i have received compliments on them everytime i have worn them beautiful,1
disappointing the text of this book is some eighty pages which appear to be a very bare bones summary of various theories of learning often with charts inserted from other books with very few examples or guidelines as to how one would actually implement any of those ideas you really just get an academic summary of these ideas with virtually no context or elaboration i would recommend you rather go directly to the work of the israeli educationalist feuerstein see the book by sharron and coulter changing children minds and that of stanley greenspan numerous books which seem to be the key works reflected in this all too brief book,0
too small this brooch is far too small and expensive for its size i was shocked when i pulled it out of its pouch may i iterate it is far too small without a moment hesitation this brooch was immediately returned,0

good finale this book explores the life of olivia winfield a k a the grandmother in flowers in the attic olivia is a NUMBER year old maid who life is changed when the rich aloof malcolm foxworth impulsively asks her to marry him but upon arrival to her new home she discovers that she is only there to give birth to an heir this is a well written book which tells you how someone so nice can turn into someone so evil but i took off a star for the glaring errors that pepper this book,1
weird but good book strange things definitely happen in this book like olivia staying married to malcolm when she definitely had the means to leave locking alicia away for something that was not her fault was another strange thing about this book overall it is a good book with a lot of twists and keeps you guessing,1
the prequel to flowers in the attic if you have always wondered why the grandmother in flowers in the attic was so mean this book is for you this is olivia foxworth story of how it all began a great novel one of my favorties,1
shirt fine company is a junk mailer shirt arrive in good condition but the company filled my mailbox with junk mail so much so that i had to out a block on anythig that came from them,0
very disappointing as a big fan of rimsky korsakov operas i have at least one audio recording of all of his operas and am collecting the dvds as they slowly come along i was looking forward to this production of may night i was disappointed the recorded sound is poor distant and the production itself sets and costumes is quite odd for me decoding the action required a libretto with stage directions and fortunately a complete libretto came with the NUMBER saison russe recording we have been fortunate to have some of rimsky operas show up in good to excellent dvd productions le coq sadko mlada tsar bride even the quirky and drastically cut tsar saltan of harry kupfer is wonderful in comparison to this newest entry let us hope a good kitezh or snow maiden comes along at some point,0
poor graphics cheap animation this game is addicting but the graphics are disaterous and the sound clips like mad maybe it just my computer but the game seems to be pretty lame and pointless btw i have a piii NUMBER mhz NUMBER mb ddram,0
worthy software game when i looked at this game without opening it i thought to myself it reminded me of roller coaster tycoon the graphics are very detailed and wonderful i tried and game out let me tell you if you love rollercoaster tycoon you will adore this game you can build secure exhibits so people can see animals like the elephant penguin and sea lion but be careful if you do not have a strong enough fence or a fence monkies can not climb out of or your animals can escape and terrorize your guests there are many buildings to add to the fun like a japanese garden or animal show so all together the gameplay is pretty much the same as rollercoaster tycoon only this is a zoo instead of a themepark o,1
zootycoon rocks zoo tycoon is the best computer game i have ever had it keeps me busy for hours and i never get bored with expansion packs it even more fun i would suggest it for anyone who likes animals and is interested in zoos you also learn about animals and what they like in their exhibits the graphics are really good and the sounds are cool too it a little hard when you start out but it gets easier it the best game ever,1
works fine at half the price the picture for this shows a totally black tire but the sidewalls are tan however that matches what i had and i bought two for only a little more that what one would cost at the local trek dealer it was easy to install with no tools and works well so far,1
no kidding my dog ate this book the first day we left her alone in the same room with it seriously,1
do not be fooled the cover shows a cute silly picture of a dog i was expecting greeting card type goofy pictures and captions the pictures were okay the captions were tasteless sick and far from funny what a waste,0
dain curse in full love the quality of the moviei have a high def wide screen tvwent to the root menuthe audio had an echo like the sound in a movie theatreadjusted the audio from theatre to living room and that corrected the musicbut i still got the echo on my tv for the talkingi played it on my computer and worked very welli will have to deal with my tv later it readjusted the whole tv system ah the good old days before hd and all that jazz there must be a sound adjustment i have not adjusted yet,1
excellent resource i have used many of the team challenges in this book in my work in youth ministry and public education there are ideas for everything from ice breakers to large group challenges that are very effective for building community and encouraging people to work together toward a common goal while having fun at the same time while some of the ideas require more complex props many can be done with items you have readily available around the house or office all of the ideas would work as effectively with youth or adults in a variety of settings best of all the text is written in rohnke witty style that makes reading about the games almost as fun as playing them,1
aweful these earings are the worst they are way too heavy and the rocks on the bottom weent the same color on was grey and one was black i do not recommend this,0
helpful but full of mistakes although this pocketbook is helpful for beginners it has one big mistake phrases and words are written in amharic letters which is a good thing but the authors were really careless when they proofread the book in many cases the word or phrase written in amharic does not correspond to it english translation which leads to misunderstandings as soon as one uses the book for nonverbal communication and that was the idea behind the usage of amharic letters,0
kindle version must be beta whoever digitized this book was not paying attention there are header lines title and author in the middle of the screen text lines end in the middle page numbers appear in the middle of paragraphs i like this author and would perhaps enjoy this story if there were not so many distractions due to poor editing save your money until someone fixes this version,0
what can i use to upgrade i have office NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER will this count as an upgrade i do not want to buy this and find out that it will not i hate office but love entourage and if i qualify for the upgrade it actually cheaper than buying entourage on its own,0
do not waste your money despite reading the negative reviews i bought it anyway the weight part was ok but i was very disappointed with the aerobics part of the tape dance steps too hard to follow camera angles bad boring to much yelling in background,0
there is more bad about this dvd than just religion this dvd has very terrible sound and very low budget video footage the only good thing is it has alot of songs and the riot is somewhat interesting bad religion is a good band but this dvd is awful you will feel ripped off if you buy this borrow it first if you can before buying it i guess this dvd could always be used as an expensive cup coaster,0
disappointed they tricked me i feel cheated in some way i heard jack blades and tommy shaw on the howard stern show playing acoustic versions of these songs i liked the sound a lot then i bought the cd and found that none of the songs on the cd are acoustic at all i am a big jack blades and tommy shaw fan otherwise i would not have purchased the cd at all but these songs are really just cheap karaoke versions of great songs shaw blades bring nothing new to them the sound is very watered down like muzak in an elevator my advice would be to just buy the original versions of these songs as performed by the original artists i will show mercy and give it two stars which it does not deserve because i did like california dreamin although even with that one give me the original shame on you shaw blades are you really that hard up for money at this point in your career that you need to release a karaoke cd,0
truely awsome ralph towner has got to be one of the finest guitarists thathas ever lived this live album is spectacular i have hadthe great fortune of seeing ralph perform live on severaloccasions in the NUMBER solo with oregon and with thepaul winter consort his performances were nothing butawe inspiring this album is a masterpiece and its live,1

unimpressed the book has a lot of detailed step by step information on how the author runs his consulting business however he comes across as a greedy egomaniac i was unimpressed one chapter in the book suggests developing passive income like writing books i was upset that i bought this books to feed this man ego and revenue stream consider the patrick lencioni book series instead,0
a breath of fresh air this album is by far one of the best underground albums i have ever heard it is a very unique blend of russian gypsy style music and good ole the magic created by this colorado band is a wonderful breath of fresh air in the mostly stagnant popular music scene of the last few years i challange anyone to listen to this album and not be dancing their all over the place,1
good product good value i recently bought two pair of these noise cancelling headphones to replace earlier headphones we had bought from radio shack we wanted to upgrade quality while not going through the roof in price i did a fair amount of online research and decided to buy the well regarded pxc NUMBER s and am not disappointed at all my wife and i use these for traveling we travel overseas and try to be pretty light so the ability to fold up and become quite compact was a strong plus comfortable to wear not too much pressure on the head good noise suppression i am sure that we would get better fidelity and bulk with bose but at barely NUMBER per pair these are an excellent choice,1
outstanding noise canceling i use these both in airline travel and at the gym the noise canceling feature functions well in airplanes in the the gym it blocks nearly all the other noises and helps block the pain of exercise,1
noise cancelling earphones ease of use excellentbattery life lasted a flight to from hawaii and still in usedecreased cabin noise good nothing else to compare it to sound quality very goodprice not as expensive as bose,1
could not even finish this one i totally agree with the other one star reviewers i only fought part way through the book before i pushed it aside in disgust while a fiction work the main character is supposed to give you a sense of who john was the book portrays him as a hot headed legalistic old man quick to anger cowardly and needing to be led by those he had mentored where are his fruits of the spirit where is the wisdom he would have from walking with the master all those years the words he spoke in the book were drivel if you want a good fiction book to read sorry i can not vouch for the historical accuracy try francine rivers mark of the lion series it a three part series i highly recommend the first two books,0
mixing historical with fictional fill in interesting book of john is my favorite of the gospel accounts of jesus christ ministry on earth i like the mix of what is historically known about the apostle john with the fictional story to fill in and make an interesting read then the gospel of john and the NUMBER epistles written by john are also included at the end of the book have also read the other jesus chronicles by same authors about matthew mark and luke i recommend all of them love being able to download books to the kindle app on my toshiba thrive tablet,1
great this book is in great shape no missing pages hardly any damage i am very happy with the service i received i will be a returning customer,1
do not expect to pass the exam i have read the first book out of the four windows NUMBER professional NUMBER studied it inside and out took the sample test in the cd rom and got NUMBER on it i thought i was ready for the exam so i went and took the NUMBER exam well this book did not even come close to what the exam was like the questions were much much harder and longer scenerio type i did not pass the exam if you are looking to just learn windows NUMBER professional really well then these books are good if you are looking to take the mcsa or mcse exams then do not count on these books to help you pass,0
really poor product maybe it was just mine the reviews were great on this products that is why i bought it but when received mine in the mail and tried it out it was completely useless i think the worst NUMBER dollars i have ever spent it would not grip any hair of mine the quality felt very poor i had better experiences with tweezers from walmart really disappointed,0
the tweezer of tweezers this tweezer is the epitome of what a tweezer should be it even comes with a little storage case can not wait for my next splinter,1
tweezerman mini slant tweezer i do not like the slant tweezers they do not grip little hairs properly much prefer the straight tip and also the scissors type which appear to be unobtainable at present not a happy chappy,0
a good book for those with experiance with x NUMBER assembly this book does not serve as a tutorial to learn assembly rather it goes into many uses of assembly such as reverse engineering and protection from a virus if you know assembly already and want to use it more effectively this would be a good book,1
worth it explains how to view education in terms of the whole person there are also people you can meet who can help you follow this approach this is the real genius of the author he not only wrote well but there are people who he has educated in this way and who are available to get to know,1
if you plan to purchase only one nelons release this is it this has become my favorite southern gospel tape the group has made full use of the members vocal talents the result is a blend of soaring harmonies and little twists and turns that will have you placing your ear next to the player in order not to miss a single note,1
on the origin of species by means of natural selection the true title that darwin gave this thesis is on the origin of species by means of natural selection or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life amazon com makes no mention of this darwin believed that the peoples of africa were inferior,0
this smells good you only think it a kid scent but this stuff is manly it a bit citrusy kinda spicy i get compliments on it all the time seriously buy this i can not recommend it enough,1
addendum mistaking the trees for the wood i forgot to mention the most important aspect of bresson last masterpiece one of the greatest shots in all cinema in the immediate aftermath of a domestic murder blood flecked on dully garish wallpaper is briefly illumined by a fallen lampshade before it extinguished shattering,1
resonant this is not on the level of kangaroo jack or charlie angels full throttle but it will do,1
horrible purchased because it was a good price and was comfortable for baby regret completely the crotch latch is so short and uncomfortable for baby worst problem was trying to remove the pad for cleaning out of three carseats owned this is the worst to clean and put back together horrible,0
do not waste your money do not waste your money not worth the time to download much less the purchase price when it does start the display does not refresh properly and the screen fills up with garbage and you can not see what is happening on the screen,0
great show i used to live in new orleans and remember seeing the crews filming this show all around my neighborhood it a great show with a great cast and most importantly a great tribute to new orleans,1
the death committiee a gripping in depth story which historically records the training and emotional depth of those who choose to become key players in the medical community a must read which will jar your emotions and expose the drama the determination and dedication of those who want to be contributors in the medical revolution,1
not happy with this the whole point of going wireless was the move the computer to a spot i could see on the bike but to finally get this to work it was almost on the tire itself and even a shorter distance than the wired unit that i had went to using my iphone and a free app on that to track all my information it worked out better than anything i tried ended up giving this unit away,0
poor quality this product came with NUMBER pieces that are warped so the oven door closes too far and the fridge door will not close all the way the stove sink top piece is split and the screw holes for the faucet were drilled too small i would not recommend,0
disappointing video i must admit i was quite disappointed with this video the video is advertised as a collection of period car commercials and promotional films it is that indeed my problem with the video is that the commercials and short promos are all of mundane subject matter there are no classic commercials or promos of the performance models the rare trim levels the more desirable luxury models as an example one promo was about the relative fuel economy of the chevrolet impala compared to it ford and chrysler competitors in which each car had a glass container mounted on the hood showing how much fuel was left as each car drove along a test track this is not exactly what i would call an interesting classic car commercial the segment on the corvair was okay so i gave this two stars overall to me this was not worth the money unless one is interested in how many shopping bags can be put into the trunk of a dodge polara compared to others in its class,0
too complex i am a long time us robotics pilot NUMBER to palm v user who has been thrilled with the battery life and utter simplicity of the palm series this device does not even come close on the basic aspect of calendar entry or viewing the day week month chooser on the palm is always on the calender screen with ipaq it is always at least two clicks away neither one will allow greater that NUMBER NUMBER hr apptments that are clearly distinguished the screen however just absolutely leave palm in the dust if palm vc was out with the screen on the ipaq i would have bought it a year ago however it will virtually always eliminate one of palms other big attractions and that is either the loooong life of very simple and inexpensive batteries,1
parts purchase kudos to the guys that helped me purchase this part i had been through many local parts stores and everyone had me waiting many days or weeks even and alot more pricey i will definitely go to these guys again and i highly recommend them,1
typical NUMBER t a i remember back as a teenager watching a current affair when maury povich was still the host there was a story on this very movie because the opening scene was filmed at a high school and consisted of NUMBER or so scantilly clad women and a voluptuous teacher that greeted the hero with the line is that an apple in your pocket or are you just glad to see me obviously this was a dream sequence but nontheless i think that alone was worth the NUMBER NUMBER i paid for this movie the rest is pretty much mind numbing,0
not happy i thought it was advanced poses instead it was some kind of breathing it was a waste of my money,0
worth listening to the early years of tangerine dream produced some incredible music although mirage lacks some of the drama of schulze in the tangerine dream days it is a very competent effort that makes for pleasant listening after listening to this album you can start to identify schulze contribution to tangerine dream and also the musical personality of klaus schulze himself,1
the best for many reasons this performance is one of my favorites in a large collection of dance videos not only for the dancers and choreography but the music too,1
great package this package is definately worth the price i got it for my palm and could not stop playing it if you are ever bored in meetings or just sitting around the house this is a great way to have some fun me and my kids love it it is just like the shooting games at the arcade i would definately recommend it if you liked this one i would also recommend the NUMBER great games for the palm,1
undiscovered treasure i believe shirley horn and this cd are an undiscovered treasure well into her seventies and not recently in the best of health ms horn is a national treasure for jazz lovers while she barely sings above a whisper her emotion timing and phrasing are on par with sinatra heady company indeed this album showcases her vocal and piano skills in a golden light combined with the lush overlay of johnny mandel beautiful string arrangements this is a truly glorious cd that stays with you rarely have i seen a cd described on amazon in such universally passionate and glorious terms,1
shirley horn here to life there is only one word for this cd delicious went back and bought two more for friends they agreed with me enjoy,0

helen fisher final solution this book makes it clear that helen fisher hates men if a man wrote a book like this from the male perspective he would be justly crucified by the media this book is a blow to the good reputation of the anthropology department at rutgers university where she was apparently employed at the time of publication i would like to say something positive about the book in order to balance out some of the negatives but i can not think of anything except maybe that it is a good addition to the library of anyone who collects the works of notable bigots in short a truly horrible book,0
can you say creepy let me say that i had never heard of diane arbus before watching this movie in a nutshell she meets the stranger living in the attic of her apartment bldg who has a medical condition that makes his appearance that of a werewolf he is just as creepy as she is she falls madly in love with him takes up photography with the majority of her photos being that of his hallway and front door yes thats right neglects her family and becomes weirdly obsessed with her hairy lover strange movie i found it disturbing,0
what the point first of all why make a film that is an imaginary portrait of diane arbus it consists of a made up story about arbus and a neighbor with a medical condition that makes him hairy all over kidman of course is wonderful robert downey jr is very disappointing and ultimately the viewer is disappointed too i suppose arbus real life story was not interesting enough,0
in fur iating this movie is really quite unfortunate diane arbus was a fascinating woman and her life should have gotten the treatment it deserved they had been debating for years about how best to approach this what won out was probably the worst idea it is fictional and only loosely based on her amazing life it is pretty insulting to her memory the fictional allegorical love affair with her upstairs neighbor is kind of insulting for it portrays her as a naive woman needing a masculine figure to bring out her artistic notions the character itself pays homage to lionel the lion faced man and imagines a meeting romance they even change her kid names for no reason i hope another film does it right,0
keeps NUMBER yo son busy it was easy enough for my son to figure out and keep him occupied during long car rides,1
another poor little women novel gina and lawrence are the main characters of the book the were best friends in childhood and that friendship continues into adulthood both are married to other people and when gina marriage ends she ends up in at lawrences house being comforted in his arms his wife is somewhat understanding but feels that gina often outstays her welcome gina goes through every poor me emotion from the divorce and it gets obnoxiously annoying will someone please write a book where the betrayed women moves on and becomes strong without having to virtually distroy her teenage childrens lives too i will not go into detail of what happens next in case you decide to read this boring novel but let us just say that it predictable yet boring with no really likeable characters very flatly written i give it NUMBER stars,0
why would anyone pay to have an ad especially one this uninformative in their cubicle i would be reluctant to take money to put up this poster,0
the vice season two a disappointment season one of the vice was just terrific good writing and of course ken stott is a fine actor but season two moves like molasses certainly the first two episodes endless dragging repetitive no action the writers sadly appear to have let the series down here to hoping they regain their initial touch,0
natural selection among people NUMBER the mechanism of natural selection among people explained the races or species of men whichever term may be applied encroach on and replace one another so that some finally become extinct NUMBER the way this encroachment until extinction occurs among people extinction follows chiefly from the competition of tribe with tribe and race with race when of two adjoining tribes one becomes less numerous and less powerful than the other the contest is soon settled by war slaughter cannibalism slavery and absorption NUMBER the morality of darwinism the highest possible stage in moral culture is when we recognise that we ought to control our thoughts and not even in inmost thought to think again the sins that made the past so pleasant to us NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER those are the main things in the book in my opinion it fails on standards of systemacy abstraction exactitude verification logic reasoning neutrality and formalising of theory,0
very week book how this got printed i do not know wish i could have seen samples of the tutorials before i purchased online,0
a comparison of two books i purchased both the princeton review and the kaplan gre NUMBER edition book i found that while the princeton review book had some good pointers the kaplan book was better organized and a lot easier for me at least to study from if you are only going to buy one book i suggest passing this one up and getting the kaplan book what really sold me on kaplan was the fact that they divided up their list of vocab words into categories instead of one big list,0

a peruvian portrait of ordinary lives written NUMBER years ago this uniquely styled novel with multi page single paragraph passages apparently used to render community scenes in a unified format seems to me to be a kind of impressionist painting in words sliding fluidly between a smallish back country city on the edge of the desert and an island village in the upper reaches of the amazon with a motley population of mostly poor but proud peasants and indians some living by smuggling contraband others by the central elaborate house where an old harp player leads a combo of local musicians the hopes and fears successes and failures of the protagonists translate neither to heroes nor villains and sad or happy events follow each other in timeless progression the respected writer produced subsequent superior works but this difficult effort still deserves patronage,1
what her problem i read this book and it obvious that eartha kitt has a problem with being black she claims that the reason they did not show the movie she was in with sammy davis jr in the south was because the racist southerners might believe she was white if eartha kitt thinks that she would be mistaken for white then excuse me but this is the queen of england typing this review,0

an all time great to many hamsun readers this one will seem to be quite a departure for hamsun as it is an urban tale centering around a bohemian clique rather than the usual tale of the norwegian peasantry as i know only those that are already hamsun fans will ever read this let it suffice to say that this book is as good as any of his works even pan so hurry up and get a copy,1

great little product i bought this little toy at a local auto mart and it has saved the day it holds the charge for weeks and has never failed me in jumpstarting a car i leave it in my wife car during the winter months in case her battery does not start and it works great definitely a high recommendation,1
poor construction for terminals seems ok at first charged fine as advertised used it NUMBER times in the first day i had it charged lucky timing and the negative terminal connector flew apart each time had to reassemble each time and it still is shakey very frustrating in that attaching to anything of any size causes it to self destruct now i have taken to just holding it on to something a la a defribulator and hoping for the best would not buy again,0

where are the sources this book is fantasy it uses very few sources to support crucial elements and hypothesis and boils down to a delusional opinion of a right wing conspiracy theorist the author refuses to debate this material because it is far fetched and unrealistic and it should not be taken seriously it uses eyewitnesses who were in nanking as sources when they agree with the author however then when those sources refute the author opinion they are cast out read this if you want to know how not to conduct serious historical research the author should be labeled as a right wing fanatic and illusionist this should be listed under fantasy fiction,0
revisionist history at its worst according to this book there was no rape of nanking it was all nationalist chinese propaganda the book is just not true it presents a lot of facts but ignores others it doesent read well,0

how to show your own dog fortunately this book is currently out of print and should stay that way the illustrations and pictures throughout the book date back to the late fifties and sixties no where in the book does ms nichols discuss in any detail the finer points of actually showing your purebred dog to her benefit she did a very good job of depicting what it is like to attend a dog show and how champions earn their pionts unfortunatly most of this information is not laid out in any organized manner at times i felt like i was having a friendly cup of coffee as she skipped from one thought to another her biggest inside tip under the chapter tricks of the trade was keep your nose clean your eyes and ears open and your mouth closed until you know what it is all about good advice since you will not learn what showing your own dog is about from this source,0
you have to see this sherlock holmes film this one had escaped me you can not believe the actor who played minister of magic fudge was it in the harry potter series i never liked him in harry potter because he was so fake and luke warm wishy washy but you will loathe him in this film a nasty evil sort of dude causing more uneasiness because of the psycholigical nature of his crimes you have more sympathy for him if he ran around shooting people not that that good either he really makes a mean blackmailer the only movie i have ever liked him in was sense sensibility,1
pigs at the trough this was a very poorly written book it was repetitive rambling and boring i suspect she had someone write it to make money,0
too little details too much sarcasm first of all NUMBER of the words in this book seem to be devoted to sarcasm it was funny at first but then became tiresome the book follows the pattern of telling you what wrong who guilty and how much money that person sucked from the american taxpayer personally i am more interested in the details of the loopholes how do offshore tax havens work how do corporate lobbyists operate in washington these details are not available in pigs at the trough,0
riotous mercifully arianna injects enough humor into this book to keep the reader out of the inevitable funk that would come from the revelations inside well done,1

great book this the second book i have read of his and it was well paced and kept my interest plan on reading more of his work,1
if you are a bela fan you will have to see it the devil bat is a real poverty row effort from the NUMBER s when bela lugosi was being offered roles of diminishing quality that being said it does have a certain campy charm as lugosi trains his electrically enlarged bats to kill at the scent of his special shaving lotion formula the big bat has to be seen to be believed and its attack cry is really something all in all a fun hour of viewing,0

the worst whoa boy i have seen some pretty lame flicks last year but the skulls definitely comes in as one of the worst it a mind bogglingly stupid tale about a pretty boy joshua jackson who stupidly decides to join a secret society and it seems all the members of this society called the skulls are pretty dumb in their own rights too of course this did not prepare me for the lame as heck finale which features a duel that right a duel involving two flintlock pistols,0
who does this remind you of lightweight film but interesting premise the sons of wealthy powerful families get inducted into an ivy league secret society in return for a vow of mutual lifetime assistance they get all sorts of advantages expensive cars grad school admissions forgivable student loans old boy network at the highest levels of society best of all their darkest secrets are whitewashed covered up and forgotten darned if this does not remind us of a skull currently running for president,0
the skulls i am a william l petersen fan but if i had a choice on watching this video again or being bashed in the skull i would take the skull bash thank you very much,0

how not to learn a language i moved to spain a year ago but in the NUMBER months before i left nyc i decided to take a spanish class to give me a head start my teacher was a native spanish speaker so i trusted his decision when he required this book i have i quickly realized after NUMBER lessons that you do not learn a foreign language by memorizing list of related vocabulary i am sure we all remember that from high school but how many of us actually learned how to speak a language that way no one once in spain and entered in a school with a real book i realized that you learn by natural assimilation of ideas a chapter or theme might start with a silly picture or story and go from there as the topic is further discussed it brings in further vocabulary in a way that is natural memorizing lists works for no one,0
a great book to have bought this ebook primarily because i was assigned a few of its short story in my north american writters class the stories are amazing my favorite ones are rip van winkle and of course the legend of sleepy hollow this particular edition the sketch book of geoffrey crayon was free on amazon com and although it is very well organized and there were not any errors that i could find i am docking one star for a critical flaw on the ebook design the table of content is not hyperlinked so if you just want to read a certain story instead of the whole book you need to go through the entire book page by page in order to reach your desired destination if the table of content had been hyperlinked i would have given it the full NUMBER stars,1
the legend of sleepy hollow and other stories the book that i read was called the legend of sleepy hollow and other stories the author of the book was washington irving i thought that was book was not that great that depends on if you do not mind an old fashioned type of language that they spoke i thought that the book was a little too complicated for me because i did not understand what the people were saying sometimes i thought that the actual theme of the book was pretty good but otherwise i did not really care for it that much i reccomend this book to anyone who ever read the actual verson of sleepy hollow and liked the story by andy c,0
do not waste your money horrible movie i actually laughed a lot but it not supposed to be a comedy the acting was terrible storyline bad the way the movie was shot was supposed to be arty but just ended up looking like a NUMBER year old child did the camera work i only gave it one star for a rating because they will not let you review an item without one if they had a zero star rating that what it would get i am sorry i wasted my money on it,0
slow and pointless i have read several of steinbeck other works they are generally good this book although is slow moving and has several irrelevant chapters thrown in the ending is definitely not what i expected,0
exactly what i needed i read a review of one of these notebooks that made me think they were teeny but i was happily surprised to find that they were almost as long as my hand and fairly wide the perfect size for a notebook to bring around with me for whenever i need to jot down a thought i ordered a few all of which i love but this one is my favorite the painting is just beautiful,1
read the club dumas instead i bought this book because i found the club dumas to be excellent i was deeply disappointed where the club dumas sparkled the seville communion merely exists and while the club dumas transcended its genre the seville communion is deeply rooted in it and that a shame because it means the mastery exhibited in the club dumas is a one shot deal rather than the arrival of a major literary talent,0
yawn a handsome priest is sent by the vatican to investigate mysterious goings on in seville after a hacker breaks into the pope personal computer and issues a warning that a church there kills to defend itself the church our lady of tears is slated for demolition and two people involved in its potential closing have already been killed perez reverte provides long i say overlong descriptions both of his characters and of seville including for example list of the names of NUMBER bars in one section of the city i read this book because it was on the list for my book club maybe i am just not enough of a mystery lover but it did nothing for me,0
a real pearl perez reverte disappointed me in the nautical chart book it was artsy too many references to books and movies as if his characters could not emerge out of their actions that not the case here his priests are real that a lot tougher than creating real cops in this world and so his vatican dibden cabal works the same vein but the comparison is all in perez reverte favor he closer here to death comes for the archbishop than to cabal cather gets the NUMBER th star that the only reason the seville communion does not,1
do not bother i had really grown to enjoy perez reverte books after first reading some of his other stories such as the fencing master the flander panel and the queen of the south i thought i gotten a good bargain by purchasing this book at NUMBER but sometimes it better to hang on to loose change in this book the plot was weak from beginning to end and the climax was unrealistic even with a stretch of the imagination i was completely disinterested in the characters whom for the most part were unlikeable anyway on several occasions i thought about putting the book down and had i not been spending a week on the beach with not much else to do i probably would have this book gave me the impression that the author was simply trying to fulfill his contract with the publisher to write a certain number of books regardless of quality before a certain date,0
review fraud the institute for american indian studies did not review this book the attributed review originated with the author,0
too vague i found this book to lack depth and explanation it vaguely lists certain herbs and plants that are of a healing nature but the true content i was looking for was not here i wanted more in depth remedies for particular ailments where this book applies certain remedies to a very hazy and small range of problems i was also looking for a guide to ritualistic traditions rather than unmeasurable herbal concoctions,0
not made for the real mobile dj it doesent have a hole in the back for the cables thats the down side thats it u have to make a hole and the amp didnot fit had to custom fit cuts in for the speaker cables,0

a book with some gorey details heart of a jaguar book had an o k plot and there were some good parts however the gorey parts made the whole book unenjoyable for me since many of them are not appropriate to discuss on the internet i will not give examples but they were disgusting occasionally the characters did inappropriate things or used profane language i know this was how people acted in mayan days but the discription of some things was a little bit much so if you love reading about bloody and gorey things you would enjoy this book,0
yaya the heart of a jaguar was a pretty o k novel with inaproprite parts it tells all out about the mayan civilization,0
heart of a jaguar review heart of a jaguar is a superb book for young adults though there is some blood and fighting explained in great detail it is a tale of great interest this book explains about a boy balam and his hardships balam a descendent of the maya has trouble finding his place in his village he is not a boy but not yet a man his village along with many others is experiancing a great drought over all heart of a jaguar is an extrodinary tale of a boy who is asked to make the biggest desion of his life this novel is geared for young adults and contains some mature material and violence,1

safety questionable i am returning this car seat after only using it twice the belt clip pulled right out when i went to clip my child into the seat i was disconcerted when it came out so easily and wondered how easily it might come out in an actual car accident the manual tells you how to re insert it but the model i bought only has one slot for it so there is no reason to make it easy to pull out since it is not adjustable with multiple slots for different sized kids i am not taking my chances on this seat,0
decent for life this product is good have not had any concern or problem with yet latching it to the car is alright since my car is decent one,1
just fine this is not a very pricey car seat but i think it just fine we have bought more expensive and presumeably safer cars seats but with twins and the need to have NUMBER seats i got this one because it was lightweight and could be used more for in and out of my husband car and family members that might take the babies god forbid we should ever be in an accident and have to really test them out but they seem safe and sturdy enough for older babies,1
great toddler and boster we got this soon after our first grew out of the regular toddler seat i found this easy to use and buckle we love it it easily converted to a booster seat too,1
can not beat the price we bought NUMBER of these for christmas gifts i would not have paid NUMBER for them but they were an excellent bargain at NUMBER each i should have bought one for myself,1

best crochet book ever i taught myself how to crochet and this book answered the questions that i had all the other books i have never explain certain things like where to stick your hook in your chain row it also contains alot of patturns i actually want to use rather than NUMBER or NUMBER in other books,1
mediocre at best happy hooker is neither a book about a hooker or how to crochet this is less than mediocre try vogue knitting on the go crochet basics vogue knitting on the go,0
errors and more errors i was so excited to get this book i wanted to make almost everything in this book because it was all so cute however i could not get the patterns to work i looked up the errata page on the book website and it still did not work there are so many errors in this book that i can only successfully complete one pattern for the granny square afghan i loved the driving gloves but the pattern is so incorrect i never could finish them i do not know if every pattern has errors the problem is that i do not trust the patterns to be correct and i am not experienced enough to figure out if they are correct just by looking at them perhaps if you are a true expert in crochet you can figure out how to fix the pattern problems on your own however this book just sits on my shelf unused because i am not going to buy the yarn and spend hours working on a project i can not finish,0
please come on the number of errors i made the capelet twice even though the ending stitch count was not what it should have been due to the pattern error an intermediate crocheter would simply know to make increases or decreases if appropriate and move along a beginner may just be frustrated when it does not turn out as it should then there was the beanie pattern that i basically winged and made from memorizing other beanies that i made before the fashions are cute and inspiring but very basic and can probably be found for free on the internet,0
lives in denial having read most books on krishnamurti i would give this book only two stars lutyens decided not to disclose the extent of the personal relationship even though by her own admission she knew about it from krishnamurti himself to that extent sloss is accurate however sloss is living in complete denial by not acknowledging either the culpability of her father who was a court established embezzler of public funds not to mention her mother who was a married woman at the time she began her relationship with krishnamurti there are some other allegations against krishnamurti as well but the lack of any objective evidence indicates they are likely a projection of personal bitterness sloss has certainly not helped her credibility by waiting for several years after krishnamurti death to go public with her version of events that took place many decades earlier,0

not what you think first off this helmet is enormous even in a medium it is the right size for my head and fits ok but i might as well flip it upside down because is sits on the top of my head and does not really go on or around it there is so much padding inside it that it does not even slide halfway down your head obviously a knock off with the materials used i do not understand why there are so many good reviews the chrome looks nice but it so easily corrupted that i scratched it with my fingernails trying to get the stickers off of it i can understand that in order for it to be dot approved that it should include a lot of padding but the only way this helmet would be safe is if you fell straight down from the sky onto your head i am definitely returning this helmet despite having to pay for shipping both ways i will up my rating review if the refund goes smoothly,0
one star for amazon all the stars in the heavens for mozart zauberflote of course but there seems to be a bizarre confusion on this product page and in the reviews that follow it the two editorial review must refer to different books several of the reviews suggest that they concern a children retelling of the magic flute story in english with illustrations is this a full musical score with the libretto in german without translation as another reviewer complains or a story book for children your guess is as good as mine but i would not buy it on guesswork,0
good clean show my daughter requested these for christmas she watches them over and over this is a good clean show for teenagers highly recommend,1

i could not put this one down this book is NUMBER pages long and i read it in NUMBER days putting the book down was impossible and i took it wherever i went even though the book is kind of a copy from lord of the rings it still will get you hooked i recommend this book for ages NUMBER to adult interesting turns are always happening to the characters if you can live through the semi boring first NUMBER pages you will love this book,1
my favorite book do not listen to the people who are giving this NUMBER and NUMBER this is the best book i have ever read if you like fantasy books you definately have to read this,1
adam s NUMBER i thought eragon was one of the best books i have ever read the best part had to be the end i am deffintly reading eldest and the rest of the series,1
i love you little one overuse and improper use of language no starsboring one dimensional characters no starsboring one dimensional and repetitive plot devices no starsabsence of originality but the weyrcat pretty cool anyway one starbrom eragon relationship okay one stareragon arya relationship with yucky adolescent wet dreams minus one star getting me to read the eye of the wheel NUMBER starshaving my husband leave me annoying voice mail in a deep raspy voice saying i love you little one NUMBER starsand that adds up to one star no paolini in my future,0
adventure magic and enchantment i loved it i begged my mom i screamed i threw a temper tantrum for her to read more every night because i wanted to know what was going to happen next just kidding no temper tantrums but i did beg it filled with cliff hangers that make you need to know more it sad and somebody important dies i have to confess that it has been done before there were alot of things similar from other books like somebody important dies in harry potter too but still it is done in an original way christopher paolini has his own unique attitude and stlye i can not wait to see what will happen in the eldest there is a red dragon on the cover not blue and this book left me wanting to read more in the trilogy,1
i think i have read this before wow i have never seen so much borrowing done it amazing in my opinion this should not be allowed to happen but evidently i must be in the minority perhaps most people are not so well read as i and think that this book is in some way original in my opinion it is in no way original there are borrowings from every major work of fantasy and most minor ones it really distracting as you attempt to read this is one of the few books that i have started and could just not continue with it was truely horrid wonderful beginners work i guess and great for a seventeen year old but why publish it,0
horrible one of the worst books i have ever read ever i forced myself to read it only because it was a gift but honestly it not worth the paper it was printed on i wish i had those hours of my life back i totally regret reading it the characters are flat and have only one demension the names are either copied from better books impossible to pronounce or complete cheese through out the whole book you feel bad for the characters because the dialog is so bad i have read better work by NUMBER year old class mates,0
good read despite the elitest raving i read this book in two days at work i liked it very much though i did find that it had many common elements of other fiction what does not everyone should know there is never anything that is original now everything is a copy and it can be easily argued the people raving about how bad this book is are simply elitist they have had favorites in the past and are acting like they are rouge scholars and this book is not worth there very valuable time they are full of it i say congratulations kid i look forward to reading on and finding out what happens to our young hero,1
cute story but its been done while i applaud the kid efforts and see a fine writing future for him i must point out that this book is a regurgitation of every other major fantasy series to date if it were not in fact his parent publishing company i doubt he would have been published the story itself is cute but the writer is young and needs many more years of polishing before he can reach the standards of those authors he parroting in this book it quite sad that there is nothing new in this book i had hoped for better,0
bland the kind of repetetive banal tolkien referrenced nonsense that gives fantasy a bad name loved by pre teens juveniles and neophytes to the genre not a bad introduction to fantasy if you are young but definitely uninteresting to an adult reader,0
rip off this book was the dragonriders lotr and harry potter in one even the names arent original the hero of destiny lotr aragorn eragon eragon the elf mistresss lotr arwen eragon arya the evil foot soldiers lotr uruks orcs eragon urguls the wizard lotr gandalf eragon brom the evil speacalist lotr nazgul eragon rozack lotr mordor eragon morzan the list goes on and on the character development is the same and the nations are exact both have dwarves who have shut themselves from the world and a love story between a man and an elf shaky alliances between the evil foot soldiers and the evil empire and the spells all resemble that of harry potter this book is ok but if u want a real adventure story thats original read all of tolkiens books,0
if their was a NUMBER star i would choose it i definitley give a NUMBER star i would if it were an option some well known to eragon NUMBER aria and eragon will probably turn out to be brother and sister NUMBER eragon is mad at murtagh for being not enough and later in the book is happy that murtaggh is such a fighter NUMBER guess what story this is a boy and an older man go off for an adventure nope your wrong its not star wars NUMBER aragorn and arwen eragon and aria call me crazy but they sound familar i am sorry i wasted NUMBER hours reading this book,0
five stars does not even do it enough justice fantastic amazingly thrilling paolini deserves an a very original action packed and all out cool this book is defenatly a best seller by the way saphira was so well developed i pictured the perfect dragon in my mind no young author can out write this master of the english language,1
an awesome read eragon is an awesome read for people of all ages ecspecially those who enjoy fantasy eragon has managed to hold my attention better than many fantasy books including the lord of the rings series it a fantastic story about a boy that enters the ranks of the legendary dragon riders i do not want to give too much away so honestly if you have a chance read eragon it incredible just one warning start early in the evening if you do not you will find it well past midnight before you manage to find a good place to leave off,1
it not worth reading there are a lot of one and two star reviews about eragon they seem to fall into NUMBER categories NUMBER the fantasy fans who have read other fantasy books or watched fantasy movies and therefore know that eragon is a rip off and they are not happy about it NUMBER the people who know something about good writing and therefore know how badly written eragon is and they are not happy about it NUMBER the people who think the book is boring and predictable and can not finish it personally i did not like it because the female characters in eragon are a joke well all the characters are but especially the females i think if you buy it you will probably regret it take it out from the library and see what you think because it quite possible you will hate it,0
ewww this was one of the worst books i have ever read the plot was quite interesting but the way it was wrtitten was horrible it dragged on and on about unimportant topics and was extremely boring the action started around the two hundreth page i would definitly not recomend this book,0
i do not care how young the author was at the time it sad that so much of the hullabaloo over this book comes from the fact that the author was a teenager when he wrote it that all well and good and impressive but that does not mean the book is super i am sorry but when i read it i did not think about how old the author was and take that into consideration the fact is that this is a so so fantasy that follows the lines of so many other so so fantasies without doing anything the least bit original the characters are flat the pacing is horrid and someone needed to rip the thesaurus from little paolini hands no one needs that many adjectives per sentence painfully generic and nothing at all special,0
great audio theater i had already read the book and the eldest book before purchasing this set it is an excellent quality audio book it amazes me that one man did so many different voices he is an excellent actor the dragon voice sounded funny to me at first but now i can not believe they will use a women for the voice in the movie dragons are big creatures with big voices a few friends have listened to the cds because they did not want to read it all before the december NUMBER th movie is released they loved it too and the eldest cds audio books done well can be a great way to experience a story i have purchased other audio books that basically just read the book aloud this was acting its worth the money we have enjoyed listening to it at least NUMBER times since it was purchased,1
i was forced to read this book at gunpoint by fan boy terrorists when i was in grade school i could remember the corny holiday card making projects those with no originality which were the majority of kids in school sprinkled glitter and crappily and happily glued little bows on the card those few who rebelled and wanted to differ from the class herd drew santa on fire or added some far different materials on it the point of the metaphor is yeah you love like eragon not so much because it is your genuine preference but because you do not want to differ from the class herd that and you probably lack a basic reading in significant literature but hey if this author can sell out and sell his books out more power to him you have a right to your opinion but that does not make this book read any less like hackneyed cardboard fantasy prose it still does,0
eragon have you ever been in a place where riders and dragons rule the book i am writing this review about is eragon by christopher paolini the book takes place around the medevil ages in the NUMBER in early europe i would classify the genere of this book as fantasy and adventure because of the dragons and the long journeys the story is about a young boy named eragon who finds a blue stone that really a dragon egg eragon has to battle to save a kingdom with his dragon saphira against dark enemies there is a sequal to eragon called eldest and there is currently a movie out based on this book i like this book because it makes you think about what is happening because the writing is descriptive i think eragon is appropriate for middle school and high school students because of the difficult vocabulary you should read eragon because it challenges you to believe that what is happening to eragon is real,1
childish and too unoriginal the amazing thing about this book was that it was written by a NUMBER year old but the bad thing is that it was horrible the charactors were so much like lotr i felt like this book was too slow paced and lacked action it also had a very loose story line and lacked any epic feeling i also felt that is was hard to love the charectors they all old or young had the heart of a NUMBER year old brom the old wise rider lacked the wiseness that charectors such as gandalf had overall i hated this book and i do not intend on reading the rest of the series,0
i have read it all before i have been a bibliophile since i was about six years old and this is the first and only book that i have ever thrown onto the floor in disgust from the poor orphaned farm boy who gets swept up into an exciting adventure to the completely predictable dragons dwarves and elves to the star wars esque evil empire and resitance movement to the appearance of the white bearded wizardly mentor tm it seems as if every single stale fantasy cliche gets trotted out and pressed into service this is a book composed of stock characters and overused plot points in an entirely typical and unimaginative pseudo medieval fantasy setting anyone looking for a good ya fantasy novel would probably be better off with something by diana wynne jones garth nix tamora pierce phillip pullman j k rowling holly black monica furlong susan cooper or any of the many other writers out there who have come up with vastly better books for younger fantasy fans,0
some southern girl ok i got to say christopher chris book eragon may have given away future plots in the story but you always had to guess when they came i mean do not you people think it nice to know how things work and yes you may be able to tell he was real young when wrote eragon but for some fantasy books that i have read by NUMBER year old people eragon had way way more action and about the whole crying thing if you acctually read the book you would understand that eragon had alot of pain in his life and to top it all off it was all happing at the same time first with people he loved dieing and losing good friends for a while come on people show some sympathy so to conclude my review i give it a two thumbs up chris could have done a little better but that what practice is for right but if this goes against what you think deal with it,1
almost amazing the story of eragon has all the makings of being one of the best fantasy books i have ever read it only falls a little short during the few passages and plot lines that seem forced and do not allow you to get completely sucked into the book overall its worth reading,1
obviously writen by a NUMBER year old this book may have a good plot line but by chapter three i began dreading picking this book up to read each night i picked this book up because i am an imense harry potter and artemis fowl fan i was very disapointed the subject and typically the first word of every sentance in this book is a proper noun trying to keep track of the he she they and its quickly became annoying also the author can not mention any inatomate object without giving you several long metaphores or symolies to describe it this book reads as though it was writin by someone who has never heard of any literay devices other than symolies and metaphores and believes writing a good story means cramming as many of them into it as humanly possible sometimes less is more,0
eragon book review this book was wonderfully imaginative and captivating it contains all the elements that a fantasy reader could want and more the action emotional features and the bonds of friendship are so clearly shown that it is nearly impossible for a person not to get caught up in it all christopher paolini brings out the hero in his brave yet young character eragon paolini shows us how destiny controls our lives and that we have to accept who we are no matter how much we wish otherwise in the end we may have bigger plans made for us in our lives than we ever could have made for ourselves christopher paolini my thanks for the wonderful journey,1
i love this book wow this was a great book i anticipate the rest of the trilogy i am a fan of pern and when anne mccaffery had rave reviews of eragon i had to buy it i have not been disappointed i highly recommend this book and intend to have my NUMBER year old son read it starting this weekend i am normally a very slow reader but i was finished with this tome in less than NUMBER days something of a record for me my congratulations to mr paolini i can hardly wait for more,1
hmmm this is alright for a beginner but i hope his next book improves greatly otherwise i will not even bother to read the third one one thing that bugs me about this book is that the author seemed to keep changing his mind about almost everything for instance his dragon she keeps almost changing shape she supposed to be so huge and strong but can not carry three people she flies way up in the air one day but the next day she can not breathe that high it makes no sense its as if the author keeps switching from one story to another i do not think it was written well,0
a knockoff yeah but i liked it ok so its obvious paolini was a tolkien fan and his descriptions of elves and dwarves come right out of middle earth but i could not help it i liked his story as it progressed i found myself checking his map and seeing exactly where his characters where and where they were going and i was hooked although i could tell a teenager albeit a talented one wrote this book i thought paolini writing and plot got more polished the more i got into it i will be reading the next one for sure and i am not even a kid just a middle aged housewife i am sure any young reader would love this story,1
cliched derivative passable eragon is a fantasy novel written by christopher paolini he started when he was fifteen and finished when he was nineteen which is truly a noteworthy accomplishment this book has been hailed as a phenomenon and has become an international bestseller but honestly i wrack my brain trying to understand how and why for those who have read and love eragon i hope you become exposed to real fantasy and science fiction soon for those of you who have not read this let me make a suggestion read lord of the rings and watch the original star wars trilogy you will know all you need to know about eragon and you will save your money,0
needs works i picked up this book based on some of the hype generated around paolini while i have to agree with some of the other reviews regarding the writing style and the portions of the story which are influenced from some very geat authors even though paolini has taken plot lines from other authors i will wait to see where these stories end up i do not want to trash his first effort completely and look forward to seeing what the next volume has in store hopefully the editing issues can be resolved by then,0
not too great this book is a major acomplishment for a NUMBER year old but so much stuff is ripped off of lotr it really predictable and you can see what will happen chapters early if you are NUMBER years old what really bugs me is that paolini describes every single thing in the book i mean do we really need to know what all the unimportant characters look like with so much choppy detail also sometimes the characters speak like it middle earth and sometimes they speak like it today,0
great book MENTION the bad reviews the inheritence series is a great series to read i loved every word in it also read the next NUMBER books,1
a real stinker eragon is a total joke i am like the only one i know who finished it most of my friends tossed theirs does any character do anything it makes sense on it stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid,0
borderline plagiaristic eragon is a fluffy version of lord of the rings or the wheel of time it should not have been published i recommend reading the golden compass by philip pullman instead of eragon it is much deeper and much more original,0
had he been much older i doubt this would have been published sure it good for a NUMBER year old but that does not make it good literature i think i have seen fan fiction better than this so many elements of the plot locations even names are almost shamelessly derived from other works of fantasy such as lord of the rings and wars i read this in NUMBER th grade and of course loved it now i have gone back re read it and it almost painful how so much of this over praised purple brick is clearly written by a kid it good for a NUMBER year old sure but to me that does not save it from being mediocre nonetheless if he keeps this up paolini shows great promise at an older age but for now i much rather read philip pullman dark materials or anything by tolkein instead this overrated purple brick of a fantasy novel kids will probably love it but anyone older will probably be able to see through it,0
i could write a better book the only thing that grabs any attention to the inheritance series is that paolini is only NUMBER if the exact same book was written by a NUMBER year old the book would have sold about NUMBER copies the book is completely a ripoff of good sci fi stories and the plot makes no sense no sense whatsoever do us all a favor and buy a get fuzzy comic book peace out local crazy monkey,0
best fantasy book ever despite what other people have said about this book it is most likely the best fantasy book that i have ever read the people that complained about his language and choice of words obviously did not read the book that i read his vocabulary in this book was outstanding i can not believe that he is only NUMBER and just because he knows to use other words besides does not make the book tacky i think that its awesome that he uses rich vocab many books written by accomplished authors do not even write as well as this man did i can not believe that people could criticize a book and dislike it just because he has wonderful vocabulary in this book the people whom criticized it probably are just upset and jealous because they did not know what the words meant and do not have that good of a vocabulary this book is awesome with a deep plot developed characters and tense battles read it,1
fun read this book was a fun read there are times that you can tell that the writer was in his mid to late teens when he wrote it and other times that he writes far beyond what you would expect from someone his age excellent read that i would recommend to any fan of this genre,1
very entertaining i enjoyed this book quite a bit while it is a bit derivative the way it was written is entertaining and there are enough original components to keep you interested,1
boring and bad writing all i can say is that i could not get through it poorly written and rather boring i love a good fantasy book and there are many good ones out there that others have listed do not bother with this one,0
save your for something worth while like so many others i was not going to comment on either of these books but some of the recent reviews pleading with people to read it makes me sick begging people to read this do read the reviews however and do read them with a grain of salt the good obviously are there to promot the book but many of the not so good reviews are there to promote it too do not fall for this and waste money lining this author pockets i rate this as negative NUMBER star do not buy this book you are better off without it,0
do not leave me hanging i just could not get this book i was so confused with this made up language and the the main character drove me nuts is he this great dragon rider who can use magic or is he a pouty teenager from the NUMBER st century when i got to the end i was so upset because i felt that there was so much that has been left unanswered i felt that i was left hanging with some important issues such as eragons parents it seemed to me that at the begining of the book he cared a great deal with wanting to know about his parents especially his dad but when it was discussed later on in the book eragon never tried to find out any information especially when the character brom talked about his mother and the fact that he knew her which led me to come up with my own speculation of was brom his father who knows because nothing was revealed,0
copy cat overall i thought eragon was a pretty good book i liked the way paolini described the land people and dragons although he needs to learn to be more original i can see getting your inspiration from a book the lord of the rings but this is just taking it too far paolini is obviously talented so he should use his talent and creat something of his own eragon needs to stop being so inquisitive some of his questions that are needed to describe things could be answered through the story instead of by the characters the story has an okay plot line and i am eager to see where it takes eragon but advice for paolini on future books use your imagination and do something original it easy to imitate other books but it takes talent to come up with something new,1
exquisite and riveting when i had first heard of the book i thought it would be a ridiculously confusing science fiction fantasy book that was not worth the trouble of reading however i gave in and checked it out form the library after my curiousity rose when i saw its unpublished sequel being sold on amazon i am very glad i did eragon staisfied my appetite for a good decent and understandable story about dragons and eragon and saphira i enjoyed the plot development and the creativity paolini put into making the story and its world seem real and fascinating i wait patiently and curiously for the second book of the trilogy eldest which i hope will be as good or exceed eragon loved it and recommend it to all fantasy genre lovers enjoy,1
boring and well boring i believe that my title says it all but i will add a little more if you have read this book you might have noticed that the main charactor eragon is knocked out during all but one battle scene from this i conclude that the author is a wimp and is too frightened to write out the details of a battle do not read this book and read the tolkien books instead,0
not even close to the hype poorly written cross of pern middle earth and all the rest you will find yourself stumbling over tedious descriptions and unneccessary dialog tags trying to read a story that you feel you are read before this is quite frankly the kind of writing you find in online fan fiction,0
eragon i got an arc of the upcoming random house release of eragon at the bea in los angeles read the book on the way home out of curiosity i got a copy of the self pubbed book to read and compare i loved both i wish the best of success to the young man the random house reps are spreading this review of eragon to the trade full praise to eragon and i want more a winner tip of the hat to young master paolini anne mccaffrey,1
do not let the rave reviews fool you like many our family bought this book and the next based on the glowing reviews of the many readers unfortunately we were in for quite a shock as these are the most unimaginative poorly written books ever published at borders where i returned all four books we purchased NUMBER copies of eragon and NUMBER of eldest there was a pile of returned copies of eldest behind the counter i was in fact unable to get a refund instead i got store credit on a gift card eragon is an uninspiring story chock full of tired overused characters the prose is unimaginative very wordy and fails miserably on all levels each characters talks just like every other character i do not know why everyone said this book was so good my kids are in tears thanks a lot chris paolini for ruining our last week of summer break,0
two things eragon has two things going for it NUMBER the cover come on ya got to admit that it pretty right NUMBER the plural of galbatorix is galbatorices,0
a kid review awesome book i am NUMBER years old and i really do not like to read very much but my mom suggested i should read this book i started reading it and loved it eragon is an awesome book and i think everyone who likes action packed fantasy books should read it its about a teenage boy who finds a dragon egg and raises it to be a powerful beast together they go on a journey to fight the evil king galbatorixs this book is NUMBER pages of fun i can not wait to read the next one,1
yuck shallow characters uninteresting story and an unoriginal fantasy land fail to sate my sense of wonder it like so many previous reviewers said its all been done before and chris has just stapled all these mediocre fantasy staples into one humdrum conglomerate of nothingness kind of what stephen king did in the dark tower adams baum only at least king can write anyway do not bother with this steaming pile of sentence fragments and embellished adverbs if you want a good young adults fantasy saga check out philip athans his dark materials contrary to this you will not be disappointed,0
you can run but you can not hide this book is a rip off the famous star wars saga i can not stand it it also borrows a few ideas from the dragon riders of pern and lord of the rings it may have been an enjoyable read but still pathetic,0
excellent effort having written fiction since i was NUMBER that NUMBER years ago i am impressed by what this young man has achieved it not great literature nor even particularly original but it an excellent start i could not have done as well at his age and i am a dam good writer,1
not great but not terrible ok it was pretty derivative although i admit i never clued in on the star wars similarities until i read some reviews and the writing was pretty pedestrian but i did enjoy it and that has to count for something a good introduction to the genre for young readers yeah i think so,0
an entertaining read is it the same world that others made up yes that true there little originality in eragon universe is the prose below the level of tolkien obviously it is on par with robert jordan which i think is decent enough as eragon is merely another fantasy novel and not an epic work is the plot completely and utterly predictable it is so predictable that the complete plotline of the entire trilogy is spelled out in a fortune telling early on but is it entertaining yes if you can settle for the penultimate if you can enjoy a book for its vividness and adventure even if it was not written by an oxford scholar then you will love eragon it is not lord of the rings it is harry potter,1
eragon is amazing eragon was looking for a deer to eat for his family he tried to get the deer but he found an egg instead he did not know what was inside of it one day the egg hatched and a baby dragon came out then the dragon flew in the sky and turned into a big dragon but then eragon had to fight the darkness and kill the person who makes fire read this book to find out if the firemaster dies this book is for eight year olds and up,1
time for credibility reality check the reason people claim to love this book is because it was supposedly written by a kid definitely time for some truth in martketing knopf paolini is at this time NUMBER years old if i do the math and go back NUMBER years that makes him NUMBER or NUMBER when eragon was published a NUMBER year old is not a kid so why market this book as written by a kid only reason i can figure is since the book could not be sold otherwise as for litery quality or merit this book has none i did not dislike it due to the fact it was derivative i disliked it because it was contrived poorly written and lacking any redeeming quality parents before letting your kids read this think twice about the poor example being set,0
verbose this book is full of adverbs and adjectives and extremely verbose sounds amateurish lost my interest stick to established fantasy writers to get your money worth from your reading,0
wow a wonderful book full of fantasy and wonder when you think you have the plot figured out it changes and changes again better than lord of the rings and harry potter in my opinion,1
geez as other reviewers have alredy stated eragon does draw too much from other much better works of fantasy what i noticed the most though was how much was taken from david edding belgariad the stories are so alike eragon is a farm boy just like garion eragon is an orphan just like garion eragon befriends a storyteller who turns out to be a sorcerer just like garion eragon does magic in the same way garion does through the will and the word i could go on and on i think paolini counted on the fact that most people have not read edding masterpiece one of the only resons his book sold so well was because he was so young when he started writing it also the dialogue is stupid and it is obvious that he tries to make his writing sound impressive through flowery writing style,0
i really wanted to like this book really i wanted to like it that why i kept reading but ultimately an editor needed to sit him down and tell him to take it down a notch or two it was soooo overwritten and totally unoriginal i got the feeling that paolini is used to everyone defering to his superior intellect and that nobody around him had the sense or the heart to tell him his book was crap it took me days to plod through it,0
good but written by a teenager this book was pretty good it took a while to fully get into the story and i did not think the plot or action moved along enough but am interested to see what happend to the cahracters in book NUMBER you can tell it was written by a teenager as some of the vocabulary plot development and character assessment were rather rudimentary i did like how there were some new types of chracters introduced into the fantasy world such as the werecat but overall it was worth the read,1
even for a seventeen year old this is among the worst fantasy books i have ever read and it infuriates me that it is getting so much attention i could possibly forgive the utter lack of ingenuity of its plot or the language which is more suited for a NUMBER year old if only i saw some signs of the author caring about the quality of his book unfortunately it is obvious for the entire first third of the book that it was not even edited for basic grammar and i find it insulting,0
wow what a disgrace oh my god this novel makes me want to eat six lemons and call my mom to tell her i hate cats this is not in any ways original what is happening to childrens fiction these days,0
meh this book redefines derriviative it seems like the sort of fan fiction where the writer goes in to other writers worlds kills their dragons steals their gold and makes out with their arwen this book makes a fine door stop or paperweight though NUMBER star,0
not impressed the author makes many radical and unrealistic assumptions based on the bible with not one reference or footnote and no bibliography,0
learn the lessons in the bible to be able to go through the entire bible verse by verse chapter by chapter book by book with such an amazing bible teacher is such a blessing pastor chuck clearly teaches topical lessons we can learn in the bible which were put there for us by god,1
the book was great this movie not so much nowhere near as good as the book nothing like it you might like the tv personalities though still love deepak though smart man,0
light funny british christmas fun my kids and i really enjoy creature comforts it is laid back dry british humor the characters and voices together make the creatures endearing clean humor it has no plot to speak of and no action so if those are important to you you might not like it,1
positively hilarious this has become one of my favorite annual christmas viewings and the funniest of my very large library of christmas specials so original and creative and so very hilarious good pickup for just about anybody,1
creature comforts christmas i really love this short movie and i am glad i could actually find it and for a great price so thanks a bunch,1
interesting i found the book interesting enough to stay reading it i was never bored with it i am always looking for a good western,1
another great addition to the collection not as magical and is darker than the first NUMBER movies overall it was a great movie the ending leaves you anxious to see the next film,1
harry potter movies are outstanding the harry potter movies are great my favorite is the goblet of fire it has a lot of action in it other than the to be expected it was closer to the book than i expected,1
great prices i was very happy with this item it was shipped quickly and it was still in the factory packaging just as promised and the price was perfect i watched it the day i got it,1
harry potter rides again another fine adaptation though you get the sense that they could have added in more the students are growing up the stakes are getting higher and this of course features the full return of voldemort and of course there the character played by an actor doomed to play that infernal pasty white sparkly vampire in the years to come where a voldemort or wormtail in those twilight films when you really need a sparkly vampire dispatched anyway,1
guilty drek in the first degree all of the harry potter movies as well as the books are artless adolescent no rules fantasy composed of pubescent cultural drek of interest only to those newly familiarizing themselves with incipient secretions of estrogen and testosterone mature adults stay away unless you consider gagging and retching forms of entertainment the most recent goblet of fire is actually the worst mostly for the length of time NUMBER NUMBER hrs it takes to pass rawlings is no tolkien and director newell provided no improvements the special effects especially flying are too fast and furious to be appreciated as anything but blurs if you must see this travesty complete the experience with stale popcorn,0
is this a bootleg copy i ordered this to replace a missing copy for our home collection the hp movies are our favorites and we watch them often i loaned goblet to someone can not remember who and it been more than a year i finally decided to admit it not coming home and ordering a new one unfortunatly you get what you pay for here i was excited to find a coopy for around five dollars and did not think twice about it since blue ray is becoming popular and it an older movie now but when we watched it last week the dvd plays but skips and catches every NUMBER minutes or so and the picture looks i have not bothered trying to replace it since it was only a few dollars but i will be looking for a real copy soon,0
bait and switch warner bros has shown us the dark side of the entertainment business by releasing this ultimate edition without the extended version it unfortunate they will still make money on these flawed editions from people who were pleased with the year one and year two sets as was i which included both the theatrical and extended films who will feel compelled to keep this incomplete set i will be returning mine i encourage everyone who feels the same to write about it whether it in these reviews a blog or emails directly to warner bros letting the powers that be know that their customers are dissatisfied is the only way they will even consider terminating these shady business practices the following link is to warner bros studios online customer service,0
very entertaining i am not certain that this edition is better than the dar kand disturbing prisoner of azkaban although it is solid entertainment in a sort of potentially fatal olympics kind of way the acting is improving with the maturity of the cast and the goblet of fire really brings this into the light a must see film for fans of the series although perhaps not the best of the series fans of this harry potter type of fantasy also check out artemis fowl or the uncommon adventures of tucker,1
italian language available someone could tell about italian language on ultimate edition thanks for helpharry potter and the prisoner of azkaban ultimate edition blu ray,0
not extended there is an extended version and this is not it it is on television all the time clever of the wb to make the first two extended and not the next two i assumed they were extended and bought them,0
what a dirty trick ran into bestbuy today grabbed the first dvd of potter i saw got home it was one disc no special features why not just make one edition like with all the other potter movies what a dirty rotten trick pulled by warner brothers,0
betrayed if you are a fan of the book do not watch this movie they have turned what may be the best book of the series into an amusement park ride all flash and no substance as the books evolve j k rowling has targeted an older and more mature audience this movie targets the mindless,0
why a director is able to ruin an adventure of a lifetime harry potter movies NUMBER and NUMBER and NUMBER are excelent they cut obviously but the story was still a clear presise message then along comes a yodelin rough backin coyote to change everything the way he sees fit heres just some of the loose ends left untied why did neville go nuts by the cruciatus how did crouch live escape attack moody who killed crouch where did the house elves go when is fudge going to call dumbledore mad what about rita skeeter or spew and theres hardly any snape at least the actors were good daniel radcliffe emma watson and rupert but the director must think that because they call it harry potter it can not be about any one else i quote potter and the goblet of fire is about harry potter and the goblet of fire period,0
good job geniuses okay everyone who given this movie a good review and critiqued the rest of us for comparing it to the movie is not too bright what you fail to realize is that the movie does not form a coherent plot unless you have read the fourth book so the book fails on two fronts as a movie it is not coherent enough to be considered good too much time is spent on things that are not crucial while crucial events are extremely undercovered see chapters NUMBER as a movie replicating a book it miserably fails all can agree NUMBER star next time pick a side and stick to it,0
enough chumps will buy it anyway goblet of fire the movie is an unacceptable hash sure the original is a long book did the mercenaries running this franchise think perhaps to make it into two movies and sell them both i understand that a film adaptation of a novel is an adaptation not a copy in another medium but it must still be a finished work in its own right goftm is so disjoint and illogical and the progress through it so unmotivated that a fair amount of what happens in it makes no sense it would be a complete waste of money even if the book did not exist this is not a film but an insult slapdash haphazard chopped up exploitation the cinematic equivalent of a barbie doll,0
very cool book beautiful book cover and art are incredible very proud to display in home this is a great quick read and this edition is very nice,1
greatest author this novel is one of the best ever written by the greatest author ever i first read this book when i was in third grade and still love it five years later this story was the first to get me into the fantasy genre and it has truly been a marvelous journey ever since to anyone who enjoys a good story read this tale of elves dwarves dragons trolls hobbits and wizards also if you choose to read this novel do not forget to read the even better lord of the rings trilogy by the same author remember to read this first however do not listen to the other reviews which state that this book is a load of hogwash it is in fact a wonderful adventure that a reader will never forget,1
cheesy boring sometimes when i was reading this i just feel like why am i reding this people told me that its a goodbut technically it makes no sense at all its not tht great honestly,0
there and back again a hobbit tale by bilbo baggins this is the story of bilbo baggins a hobbit of bag end under hill hobbiton the story tells of how bilbo came to be involved in the dwarves mission to travel to the lonely mountain defeat smaug the dragon and retrieve their treasures and their homeland it a great tale of survival through untold hardships when all seems to have failed and yet a little luck and a little perseverance sees them through the hobbit is a great introduction into tolkein world and a great set up for the lord of the rings i highly recommend it,1
nicely done this audiobook is a good i was looking for a good audiobook where where i can relax and listen to well i found it a very good renbition of the hobbit buy it,1
what a horrible book i just do not see how everyone loves this book it is a never ending tale of bilbo baggins and his with the wizard and dwarves j r r tolkien is a quite horrible writer the story goes on and on and on continuing with them hiding in a cave fighting a dragon or another thing of that sort i am a pre teenager and i still can not focus on it because of its pure stupidity,0
well this book wins the award for the most boring stupid this book had way to many characters is boring from start to end and has no point what the hell does this book mean,0
deluxe pocket edition i own many copies of the hobbit to include the audio and ebook this is a perfect travel version and read it often font size is perfect for me and the maps in the cover are great for quick reference i have noticed a large number of one star reviews for this product that have nothing to do with it with most being either the kindle version or the audiobook take heed when you look at the reviews,1
all time favorite this is a classic that can be read over and over good for reading aloud to the kids on trips too,1
i loved it again i have several ragged copies of this here and there in and out of boxes i do not have to hunt any more it will always be on my kindle,1
the hobit the book is about a young hobit that goes on an adventurer to get rid of a ring that if you w where it you turn e ebook,0
how do you keep an idiot busy for hours if you have some extra time on your and feel like pissing it away then read this book i love literature however i can not believe i wasted valuable hours of my life on reading this so called book i have read technical manuals that are more interesting if there is someone you really do not like suggest that they read this book,0
the stupidest book i have ever read i thought this book was the dumbest book i have read in a long time i hated it i found it very hard to get into with all the characters listed in it i would give it NUMBER stars if i could,0
amazing i have read this book several times and it seems to get better each time i love this story very different tone than the lord of the rings after learning more about jrr tolkien it makes total sense the hobbit was written to a younger audience who would be adults by the time lord of the rings was published amazing talk about attention to detail read this book if you have not yet it is simply fantastic there is beautiful imagery sword fights dragons and trolls what not to love,1
amazing this is the best book ever as it explains many things and story in the lord of the rings book,1
classic there nothing bad to say about this book everyone should read it before they die great entertaining book for anyone,1
do not buy the audiobook please note that this review is specifically about the non bbc audiobook version i adore the hobbit my first memory of my father is hearing him read the first page of the book to me as a very young child and i have read the book countless times since then given my long commute currently i have become a big fan of audiobooks i picked this up with high hopes what a let down the audiobook is abridged although the package did not note that anywhere the abridgement choices are odd at best leave in beorn but take out almost everything of rivendell the voice actors seem to be interested in portraying the characters as comically and unpleasantly as possible i want to give all of the elves in the audiobook some throat lozenges and to top it all off the sound quality is incredibly poor and inconsistent,0
hobbit i really liked this book the beginning was kind of slow but if you keep on reading you can not put it down i really like how he used the main character as a hobbit or really small person instead of this tall masculine person who works on a farm and all the chicks dig him because people like that have a really hard time proving themselves that why i like the hobbit because bilbo proved himself even though he three foot tall it shows us that height and weight have nothing to do with our character we could be four foot five and two hundred pounds outside but a seven foot high one hundred forty pound body builder inside,1
i read it again after NUMBER years still good read almost as good as the lord of the rings trilogy but more of a kid story very enjoyable even so,1
good only for insomnia actually i would prefer to give it zero stars in a number of attempts to read this thing i succeeded in falling asleep every time in ten or so attempts i was able to get no further than page NUMBER so dull,0
the hobbit disappointed did not receive the item at all and the transaction said it was successful even got an email confirmation saying my order was successful,0
lotr is better i did not like this book very much it seemed more like a children book compared to lotr just an opinion,0
good quick and e as y read pictures are to large had to continually turn book to see them good digital copy,1
slow but good story this book takes a while to get into but i guess that is to be expected with an older novel and with tolkien writing style however a good story overall and worth reading,1
the hobbit i am not much of a reader but i must say i really liked it had little dragged out spots very adventures,1
am i missing something i read the lord of the rings trilogy before the movies came out in anticipation of them having always put them off for one reason or another naturally i was drawn to this book afterwards as a way of looking for some of the background to the story honestly i do not know what it is and hate myself for saying this but i simply did not like this book i am not sure if it the style of the narration or what it is but i found it a struggle to read i normally read until the end of a chapter and then stop for the time being but with the hobbit i found i could barely get through one chapter in a sitting i know that many are going to hammer me as not helpful for knocking the book but i just want readers to understand that this book much like lotr is not for everyone the lotr is a much better read than this one and in my opinion the hobbit is really only a necessary read for those diehard fans who really need to know where it all began,0
little people versus a huge dragon the little people win of course but boy does it take awhile for that to happen,0
great book to a great series first off i gave this book a four because in my opinion it was not as good as lord of the rings which i proudly would rate a five writers mature getting better in their writing style on their second third book tolkien did a fabulous job on the hobbit humor confilct but no romance good for children good for just anyone i thought bilbo to be hilarous the dwarfs just as funny a true classic was the hobbit that it will remain on my read again books forever until i die of course if you have not read it yet i highly recommed for anyone who is looking for a good book to try this one out i know others have said it and i will not be the last but tolkien was a master writer of our time,1
some people do you find it interesting that all the people giving this excellent book a rating of one have dozens of spelling and grammar errors in their reviews i think that is just about the least shocking thing i have ever seen and can anyone tell me where the schools that make students read tolkien are at my school we have to read crap like the scarlet letter i am jealous of you people who were forced to read this book in the sixth grade my teacher suggested that i read the hobbit and l o t r since then i have been a fantasy maniac i followed it up with terry brooks and death gate and i have not stopped yet i owe it all to the hobbit how could anyone not like this book,1
good book but no music on kindle touch the book is fantantic with lots of information and figures the only issue resides on the missing habilitie of the kindle touch to reproduce the authors voice on poems and music inside the book this can only be done in fire version or kindle for iphone or ipad not even on kindle for pc i really can not understand,1
poor edition for amazon own kindle fire hd i do wish i could review the book separately from the edition but you can not so let it be known this is about the edition for whatever reason amazon has decided to provide this book in its most complete form only on the iphone ipad the book on the ios platform has the audio available within it however on amazon very own kindle fire hd that feature is not available kudo to amazon for telling you that up front but i find it really sad that amazon does not fully support its own platform,0
awesome little book this is the second time i have read the hobbit but the first time i have owned it it is an absolutely beautiful copy gilded pages leather cover with embossing and a handful of illustrations definitely worth purchasing,1
this book is absolutely the best i read this book NUMBER years ago and it has never left me since bilbo is an inspiration to us all you can see yourself in his character i have been suggesting this book to all of my friends since i read it and each one who read it thanked me immensly for introducing them to the world of tolkien now i am tackling the lord of the rings trilogy,1
gorgeous book i had recently saw the movie and was intrigued to find out how the story ends so i bought the book i am not a big reader and have never liked paperback size NUMBER font books and this was def an excellent choice for me its an easy read and the bigger spaced out font just makes it more enjoyable to read for an extended amount of time its absolutely gorgeous and will look great on the bookshelf when i am finished,1
wonderful i have read j r r tolkien the hobbit and i think that it is a great book i recommend it to everybody it is my favorite book,1
a fine beginning while tolkien was nowhere near as excellent of a writer at this point as he would become years later with the lord of the rings the hobbit is still an enjoyable introduction to middle earth the story is more simple and the flow is more like reading a fable or children story to me compared with the more serious and high fantasy style of the lord of the rings the hobbit is more fast paced there is more action happening all the time but it not as atmospheric this is the story of bilbo joining a band of dwarves to go get treasure from a dragon named smaug along the way he braves many dangers such as orcs trolls giant spiders and meets gollum and finds a ring it a good prelude but nothing amazing however the book does hold a special place for me because i found a copy in my parents book collection in the basement when i was a kid and it became the first book i ever read i owe tolkien a thank you for hooking me on books,1
awesome this is a great tale i loved every second of it it is by far one of the best stories i have had the pleasure of reading,1
lived up to the expectations was a great book unlike lotr which i tried to read once i found this book to be very easy to read and it went rather quickly,1
great but not outstanding i enjoyed anderson book especially the background into tolkien sources and early writings that is invaluable i must say i have read the hobbit at least NUMBER times and yet i have never enjoyed reading it as much as when i read it with anderson anotations i especially appreciated the philological background into the many proper names and archaic words that tolkien used what is a carrock or what does confusticate and bebother mean now i know i also enjoyed the immense number of illustrations that were included many of them sketches and pictures made by j r r himself alas they are not in color most are black and white prints of original color pictures if more had been invested in the visual quality of this book it would have greatly added to the level of pleasure in the words of tolkien that anderson comments bring out still worth the money hopefully anderson will add color in the next edition,1
always enjoyable like visiting with old friends and enjoying a lovely chat i have read this multiple times and always find the adventure great,1
the hobbit is exceptional the story is adventure and adventure exciting and thrilling it left me breathless the characters were so real and compelling,1
somewhat overrated the hobbit is considered a literary classic for the fantasy standards it created and though there a wonderful story here the riddles in the dark chapter with gollum is particularly exciting but i was turned off by the quick writing style that emphasizes innane background details and cordially dances past what could have been epic sequences for example we get a full paragraph or two describing bilbo hobbit hole yet a measly sentence or so describing a battle in a thunderstorm between giant rock monsters the hobbit is an imporant piece and many will undoubtedly love it but i found it difficult to enjoy,0
great for kids learning about j r r tolkien my NUMBER yr old son became interested in the hobbit after a lego catelog showed up with lord of the rings and hobbit themed lego sets he tried to read my copies of the lotr and the hobbit but it was a little to much for him i was excited to find a graphic novel version of the hobbit the pictures are engaging and keep to the spirit of the story i know it misses some details that you will only get from reading the originals if he loves the story as much as i do then he will eventually read the full length novels when he is older,1
amazing book NUMBER best book i have ever read love it recommend lord of the rings as well j r r tolkien really is an amazing author,1
the lord of the rings light this is lotr light well written but not nearly to the fullest extent of the literary powers tolkein reached later with lotr the story too is more for younger folks it should however be read before lotr because it provides necessary background it a quick read too NUMBER day,1
hobbit when i read the hobbit i could hardly put my kindle down it s magic and quite a few strokes of brilence from our favorite burglar bibblo baggins,1
adventure thrill treasure a delightful tale of fantasy the hobbit is different from lord of the rings firstly its short but equally interesting the hobbit takes you to the wonderful world of mr bilbo baggins the hobbit and how he is swayed away to the world of adventure it has everything a fantasy book should have trolls goblins elves wizard and of course the magic ring i loved the book because it keeps you hooked from the first page and keeps the excitement right till the end it descriptive and a light read all throughout history we human beings have been fascinated of being invisible invisible man hollow man lotr and of course the hobbit the beauty of the book lies in the presentation and the creativity of j r r tolkien enjoyable NUMBER page read with a good adventure and strong story,1
classic i fell in love with the cartoon version of this movie as a child now as a teenager i can appreciate the book all the more and i thoroughly enjoy every moment of bilbo adventure NUMBER big ol stars,1
pretty good book the hobbit was grappling it made me feel like i was the main charecter the book is about bilbo baggins a hobbit who meets gandalf the wizard who takes bilbo and a group of dwarfs on a adventure to reclaim the dwarfs lost treasure and kill the beast that killed almost all the dwarfs in the castle that it took over this book is for someone NUMBER years old and likes magic elves goblins etc etc etc,1
an amazing novel i am sure there are many reviews for this book already but i will heap more praise upon tolkien genius the hobbit relates the reader to the character the story is also adventurous and exciting i remember the first time i read the book in fifth grade it thrilled me then as it thrills me now when reading for the third time a land of hobbits dwarves dragons and wizards the adventure is suspenseful and well worth the time after reading the rest of tolkien books i appreciate the hobbit even more it is a small part of his work but the detail he uses to weave a creative plot is astounding,1
the epitemy of fantasy this book is a travesty to everything ever written swoar lil fools wack for reall j r r tolkien is clearly a man of minimal intellect and an insufficient grasp on what a a real novel is composed of boy ai not nuffin but a playa hatin scrub daniel miller anonymous in kentucky mms,0
best book ever why NUMBER stars because it the best freaking book ever the hobbit has NUMBER adventure NUMBER an awesome villain and finally NUMBER an epic group of characters,1
the hobbit i had never read this book but having enjoyed the lord of the rings i thought it worth reading this earlier tale it is sometimes too predictable with a satisfactory outcome i look forward to seeing the film,1
trail blazer arrived on time in new unwrapped condition amazon connects with topnotch retailers that providegreat customer service,1
great listening we bought this at our daughter request when we saw that it would take NUMBER hours to hear the whole book we asked her if we could test it on a drive to phoenix and back at christmas with her approval we will take it to her this spring when we visit her in china we were entertained for the whole trip plus another hour when we got home now we have seen the first of the three hobbit movies too and were more familiar with the characters than we would have been without the great preview,1
classic we bought this book to read together with our son it was a great experience we also got a few lego sets to bring the book to life,1
fantasy master one of the best fantasy novels ever many have already outlined why this is such a masterful story so i will not replicate that effort i enjoyed this book as a young grade schooler and plan to re read it again and again this is the kind of book you want to read out loud to your grandchild and to the kid in you,1
the hobbit although the hobbit tends to be a childs book it is a must read before the lord of the rings saga it is also about to hit the big screen,1
a magical tale i loved the hobbit it was a fun delightful read tolkien was obviously the narrator and he had a way of inserting little quips that would make me chuckle the story moved along quite nicely as it was short and you ended the book feeling like the story had come full circle i would recommend that everyone should read this it a classic,1
enjoyed reading again after so many years i read the book many years ago in high school and wanted to read it again before i saw the movie it is a classic and i loved being introduced to all the characters once again,1
hobbits are just another type of elf i would strongly recommend this book to those who play dungeons and dragons i honestly do not care which of the NUMBER races of little people someone belongs to this book had a few highly actioned and interresting parts in the book but overall this book is dull and bilbo the main charachter complained most of the time for instance there was often a large gap between action scenes i was really looking up to the death of smaug a charachter who ego was expanded into godlike preportions died a pitiful death with hardly any contact with the adventuring gang and finally my favorite charachter gandalf left prematurely,0
supurbe cain coxela NUMBER the hobbit jrr tolkienbook review NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER the hobbit by jrr tolkien is about a hobbit named bilbo in the book the hobbit gets taken on the adventure of his life in one of his adventures he meets some trolls that have a cave behind them and he is sent to look in the cave to look but before he can get into the cave he gets caught by the trolls the only reason that he was alive was that a wizard saves him i thought that this was an exciting and adventurers book it had a great plot and a great story about wizards hobbits dwarfs goblins dragons and elves if you like that kid of thing you should read it it great for all ages the hobbit was a great book with a fabulous plot so if you like adventures you should read the book the hobbit by jrr tolkien i would recommend this book to people who like fantasy,1
perfect compatibility checked with sears and they could no longer help i had one remote that i had to hold just right to get it to work i ordered two of these remotes the compatibility match is perfect these are exactly as described it took me longer to get the ladder out to reach the green button on the back of the garage door opener unit then it did to set the frequency on the two i ordered took approximately NUMBER or NUMBER seconds to set the frequency on both remotes extremely easy perfect match perfect replacement wish i had ordered sooner,1
did not work this product tho it seemed to match our current one failed to synchronize with our garage door opener it did not work at all a waste,0
the bad outweighs the good this could have been such a wonderful book the prose was elegant the story was intense and everything came together well except for the fact buzz bissinger has a vendetta against sabermetrics and sabermetricians the attacks on the book moneyball and the flipant remarks attacking others like me who love the game was sickening i would avoid this book and look elsewhere for that summer classic,0
book was good the book arrived in excellent condition it was a fast enjoyable read although i feel the contents were geared to a woman no older than forty,1
i do not like it as a man i bought this book to help me try to understand how women think this book scared me the author seems to have a narrow idea of what men are i found it sexist and almost racist women that read and follow the guidelines of this book will only find men that the author describes selfish and lazy i was going to give this book to goodwill but i think that i will burn it instead,0
this is the problem with american women if you think this is how a woman should act in a relationship you have another thing coming athough i suggest to you that we neither want a meek woman but someone inbetween who can hold her own and still be a lady such a gross misrepresentation what a man wants ugh,0
beth this book is fabulous i am a NUMBER year old female who has always been the nice girl it not as if i have not had relationships yet even in those relationships i always felt like a doormat my friends and i always wondered why the guys we did not like kept coming around we would sit in the car and read this book aloud to each other this book is liberating and i recommend it to any woman looking to take control of herself and her love life,1
why men love bitches the best there is sherry is an excellent and the greatest writer there is a must read for all women out there this book is the absolute best t h e b e s t the contents in the book are amazingly true and real no other relationship books can be compared to this you just have to read it and you will see why sherry is so awesome be your own judge i love it sherry teaches you all the principles that every woman should know to believe in yourself and put yourself first start counting yourself as number NUMBER instead of number NUMBER sherry please keep writing you are truly amazing you are a goddess,1
one awesome book for any woman i was the nice girl before reading this book this book has helped me so much when it comes to dating i find myself being happier in relationship than ever before if you give to much to any man in your life i strongly suggest that you buy this book you will not regret it i am even going to buy this book for my closest girlfriends before dating another guy read this book he will help you out tremendously,1
not completely accurate this book is directed towards a certain type of women to advise them them on how to act towards a certain type of man contrary to what it suggests not all men are alike no more than all women are alike this book seems to categorize all men as chauvinists and all women at least the target audience as dumb blonds does not necessarily work out that way if you are having social issues of the sort that this book alludes to you might want to see a counselor instead of taking advice from someone who is probably as the title suggests a bitch,0
i can not believe how amazing this book is i am was your classic doormat kind of girl and i realized that i just might be doing something wrong one day i was discussing this with my friends and she recommended this book in the first NUMBER pages i learned what exactly i was doing wrong i recommend this book for every woman who feels like she needs to change herself for the better and no longer wants to be a doormat,1
great book on dating this book is hilarious but it is also very helpful i learned a lot of new tatics and approach women have a lot of power and when used properly we can get what we want from a man,1
wonderful i have told all of my girlfriends single and married about this book it is right on point and gives very good insight into the males ways of thinking and how we should interact with them we as women sometimes lose our identity to please a man and it never works i have always held my own in a relationship for the most part but i have found new insights into loving myself and loving my man without losing myself in the relationship and have found it totally true that a man appreciates a woman more when she stands up for herself has a live apart from him and does not make him her world but a part of her world i can hardly wait to read why men marry bitches,1
i do not know if this really gets to the point i am a fast reader by nature but this book took months to get through although she made some good points i think it pretty much what every other book out there says,0
wow this book was manipulation and games to the max i understand why guys think girls are so crazy sometimes because of books likes this some of the things mentioned in this book were okay but playing games catches up with you and then nobody is happy,0
the title should be for women who have no life outside of dating men if you are a woman who has no life outside of whatever man you are trying to pursue then this is the book for you this book pretty much tells women to pretend to have a life outside of your boyfriend or lover only then will he realize how truly amazing you are only then will the man will try to pursue you and feel like he is winning you over you alpha female you man thoughts gosh she has friends that she goes to the mall with on saturdays and yoga in the evenings on weekdays she such a busy and important lady she does not need a man in her life that why i like her for all women out there i know finding the right person is tough but please stop caring so much about having a relationship with a man find your own happiness within yourself you do not need to read this book to tell you to go out and have a life,0
girls it so true i personally loved this book it gave me a completly different outlook on relatonships and how to hold my own in one i used to be auch a doormat seriously this book transformed my entire demeanor and has helped me to become a dreamgirl that men respect and ultimatly want this book gives great advice and real life exapmles of how to deal and be happy with a man basically if a man is walking all over you you are doing something wrong man up girl and dump him haha i would honestly reccomend this book to any woman who is looking to improve herself her relationships and her overall attitude and confidence level,1

a hodge podge of personal trivia i doubt this would have been published if crichton were not crichton just a hodge podge of stuff medical school a few good travel essays a lot of paranormal stuff energy balancing auras channeling etc etc i see a lot of readers loved it but i thought it was a waste of time,0
crichton at his best the book arrived ahead of the promised date in fairly good condition this book blew me away wish i read it when the author was still alive i would have made an effort to talk to him about some of his experiences from the book a must read for anyone with an open mind,1
not typical crichton fiction travels is a fascinating truthful revealing compilation of adventerous essays it humorous silly terrifying at times and enlightening crichton takes his readers with him in all of his journeys to places where most people have never been it reveals what makes crichton crichton the best part of this book is that he does not expect you to believe everything if you think that the paranormal is hokey stuff then fine you can believe it is hokey stuff you can be skeptical about it i am but he encourages his readers to experience things for themselves,1

fyi although i have not read this book by nicky cruz i thought i just add my own NUMBER cents this is just a bit of trivia about the author this is the same nicky cruz who is mentioned in the book the cross and the switchblade he was portrayed in the NUMBER movie of the same name by a young eric estrada tv chips,1
a disappointment i am going to make this short and sweet what a disappointment i also waited with much anticipation for this book and was so upset i almost but a match to it the ending left me wanting to throw it out the window i loved all the previous books but like other reviewers i found myself skipping page after page searching for some action i am hoping the next one will be better usually i buy the hard copy i may wait and get it from the library,0
very disappointing if clan of the cave bear was as mediocre as this book its likely that the series would have ended right there clan was an excellent book and the others in the series were also very good but this book is very lacking in drama and repetitious to the point of boredom the detailed research which was skillfully woven into the story in earlier books and gave life and dimension to the characters and events appeared in this book as lengthy descriptions which interrupted the story as an auel fan i have eagerly read all of the previous books in this series and was hoping that the negative reviews on shelters were exaggerated sad to say they are not the only positive thing about this book is that auel fans will have a chance to re enter ayla world again after a long wait i am hoping that the next book will be better,0
a long wait for disappointment after re reading how fire is made what seemed like a NUMBER times i decided this was the most boring book i have read in a long time,0
dissapointment after waiting so long i felt cheated after reading this book which could have been summarized in one sentence ayla reaches final destination mates and has jondalar baby the rest of the book is totally plagarist from the other books in the series all the events are exactly the same just the names are changed there was absolutely no new plots involved what a shame,0
repetition repetition reputation wonderful series prior to this shelters of stone however tarnishes jean m auel reputation quite frankly i do not believe she wrote it herself,0
a must read book this book goes with the others books in this series and is a great read well worth the money and very gripping,1
snore i painfully read the entire book just to see if something exciting would happen up to the very end of the book it did not,0
fans only what is this series i guess it is romance in the same genre as those thick novels with a woman and fabio on the cover if one starts this book with that in mind you will not be disappointed it still has ayla inventing everything and healing everyone and jondalar is still an amusingly dumb blond with one endearing attribute the animal friends are still there wowing the prehistoric residents of france auel still manages to make sex scenes tiresome singlehandedly she may keep teenagers from having sex because she makes it seem so boring but a fun bubble head read nonetheless smart of the publisher to release this book in may it is the perfect beach read,0
boooring ugh how much can one read about the landscape the rocks the rivers and ayla jondalar having sex i skipped through most of the book and was still bored what a disappointment after waiting so many years i do not recommend this book to anyone i will not be reading any other sequals of the earth children after this one,0
a NUMBER year wait and this is the best she could do repetitive slow and too detailed how could there have been a NUMBER year wait for a book that was for at least the first NUMBER pages a repetition of the first books how many times do we need to be told alya has to go to the bathroom more often now that she is pregnant do we have to have her show how to make fire over and over and over where is the plot the suspense the action i do not recommend buying this book get on the waiting list at the library,0
worth the wait i thought the book was very good it does get a little boring to me because of so much explicit detail written in on everything the book is around NUMBER pages but well worth the read can not wait for the final book,1
tedious boring and tedious repetitious story line both from earlier books and from within this story how many times do you have to tell ms auel i am not stupid you know hard to remember names and an error ridden kindle transcription add to this reader frustration i am new to kindle and wonder if all kindle books are subject to transcription errors or did someone forget to edit this one tell you what amazon let me be an advance reader give me the titles for free and i will edit for you,0
same old same old but worse read the first couple of pages and then skip the next NUMBER it is all review auel should assume that people who are reading this book have read the others and should not spend NUMBER pages re hashing what we already know we already know people will be amazed and disbelieving of ayla and jondalar previous adventures we do not need to sit with them while they tell the story to each of jondalar relatives we also already know ayla and jondalar share pleasures more and better than any earthly couple ever did or could i am not reading this story to get a thrill in the last book it got to the point that whenever auel wrote about pleasures i just skipped it because it disturbed the flow of the story this book was no exception i want more depth more story and less review i have not given up on the series yet but if i have to wait another NUMBER years for the next i will not be buying it,0
i waited how long for this after waiting with great anticipation for NUMBER looonnggg years i actually took the day off work when my copy arrived so i could immerse myself back in the ice age NUMBER pages later i gave up and decided to clean house instead i now know why the book has the shortened title of sos if i ever saw a book in distress this is it i am now perfectly willing to believe all those rumors that jean is dead she could not possibly have written this drivel well actually she did it was just in books NUMBER this has been my favorite series of all time and now sadly i do not care if she ever gets around to publishing book NUMBER even ayla skills as a medicine woman can not revive this victim,0
worst book i have ever read jean auel should return any and all monies she received from the sale of this book to all the tortured readers who had to endure it,0
slooooooow i was a big fan of auel right until this book arrived it approximately NUMBER pages long and it took nearly NUMBER pages before it starts to get interesting i skipped chunks of pages because they are pure repitition from earlier in the book i will probably buy the next one but only because of the first three and to see how it ends hopefully auel will not let us down if this book was half the length it would potentially have been great i was disappointed,0
bad graphic design the first four books as they originally came out followed a consistent and attractive design pattern thus they look like a series on your shelf and are artistically pleasing the new binding looks completely different simplistic boring and the text in no way lines up with that of the previous books i do not believe they are going to get people to re buy the earlier books in the new design and the new design is not a correction to the original design the decision makers at crown publishers have once again shown a lacking in sense of aesthetics and a lack of concern for their customers,0
tedious sorry but i had alot of trouble even finishing this book i have read the entire series so far and enjoyed all the others there are so many characters one needs some sort of outline to keep track of who who the dialouge is extremely tedious with far too much small talk that adds nothing but words to the book i am thinking ms auel wrote this in a hurry to fullfil a contract obligation,0
the shelters of stone my teenage daughter and i both enjoyed reading this series this book in particular was full of interesting insight as to how people may have lived and communicated pre ice age very well written and enjoyable to read caution not for younger readers due to sexual content,0
no stars no story unfortunately amazon does not let you rate a book with zero stars how so little could happen in so many pages i will never know,0
kindle edition rife with typos i was excited to have the earth children series available for my kindle but the ocr errors in shelters of stone make it almost unreadable surely someone must review the copy before the book is made available for sale the quality of the story notwithstanding the plot rather drags as others have noted it incredibly distracting to come across so many mistakes in the text when trying to read the story publishers need to institute better quality control when issuing kindle editions of old manuscripts,0
extremely boring and repetitious i used to be a huge fan of ayla to the point that i even read the first three books more than once the fourth book however did not attract me as much until i had read NUMBER pages i find auel latest book very boring simply because there is nothing new in the book the rest of the reviewers explain perfectly how this book has nothing offer so i will not repeat their comments i would not recommend this book to any friend,0
the shelters of stone remembering way back when this series started with the clan of the cave bear how well and entertaining that and the following books were till many years later when this book came out and then the entertainment just stopped and it became a boring read i lost all interest in the characters i truly did try to read it through but i just could not do it i had to stop half way through maybe it was just too long between books or maybe i have just outgrown the writing,0
brainless dribble perhaps i was expecting too much given the long wait since book four and considering that i thoroughly enjoyed the other four books in the series however this book for me was nothing but a brain dulling barrage of introductions and recaps of the other books in the series in fact i must admit that i did not finish reading this book after NUMBER pages of pure nothing i finally decided to discard it i had help with this decision though a good friend of mine began listening to the book on tapes at the same time i began reading she finished only because she has a long commute and nothing better to do and quickly informed me that absolutely nothing happens that there is no drama action or any form of brain teasing within the pages of this new book from jean auel,0
a cure for insomnia this book is a real snooze i plan to keep it near my nightstand for the next NUMBER years just in case i have trouble dozing off i loved clan of the cave bear and really enjoyed the next NUMBER books but this book is nothing more than a NUMBER page description of the way the continent of europe looked NUMBER NUMBER years ago boring stuff as for the brilliant ayla she is relegated to a pathetic shell of her former self i agree with all the other reviewers about the boring sex scenes rehash of the clan ways etc etc that hunt on the NUMBER nd day page NUMBER thru NUMBER or so was very contrived they were so greedy they had to have NUMBER hunts this was done more to show off ayla skill and jondular spear than to entertain the reader it seems that way too much in this book is just i will not run out and buy the sixth book ms auel when i hear it been published i will re read clan of the cave bear,0
agree with just a reader the author is obsessed with her exploration of the historic sights and forces descriptions of minutiae on us that add nothing to the story in fact they take the place of character development and divert the story line as much as i liked the first three in the series i put this one down for good just over half through i would give no stars if the rating system allowed that,0
do not buy this book like everyone else i waited for tweleve years for this book and i ran out and bought it as soon as i could i want my money and my nine hours back the characters are bland there was no plot no twists and just about nothing happening that was not either easy to foresee or a rehash of books one through four wait till book six comes out then pick this one up in paperback and skim it trust me i am trying to save you the anguish of characters you can not get into events that are just plain silly and the endless retelling of events that you do not need to be told about if you bothered to read the rest of the series,0
sigh i guess it could not last forever no one is a bigger fan of the clan of the cave bear than i am i have read it cover to cover at least NUMBER times since NUMBER and the same goes for the others in the series especially the mammoth hunters which were all really great i will not be rereading shelters i am sorry to say i got the impression that the whole story inflated to over NUMBER pages could have easily fit in the first NUMBER pages of the next book all the conflict built up to in the last few books especially the very big question of the zelandonii acceptance of ayla and her clan background and son were dismissed entirely oops i guess jondalar did not have reason to be worried after all kind of makes you wonder why he almost left her behind out of fear of his people reaction there no story here just constant introduction and repetition read it only if you plan to read the NUMBER th so you will not be lost in a maze of characters,0
what happened i eagerly awaited the coming of this book but after reading it i am sorry i wasted my time there were so many chances for drama that were missed so many segments that did nothing to advance the story what little bit of action that did happen was so weak that is was not even action it seemed to me this book was just a comercial for the next book the first NUMBER books are well worth a second read but this one should be forgotten,0
like a seinfeld episode this is a book about nothing ms auel really phoned this one in and i could not be more disappointed my advice if you have not started the series is to read the first three skip four and five and hope six lives up to the first half of the series unless you want a slightly less boring version of a research paper on the topography of europe NUMBER NUMBER years ago stay away i think it took her twelve years because she kept dozing off i never have written a comment on a book before the only reason i felt compelled to do so now is after all the anticipation i feel cheated and let down of course who cares because of course i will buy the sixth one too just to see if things look up still i think i will wait till it gets to the NUMBER nd hand store next time,0
enough already only reason to continue the series at this point would be to see how many more pages it takes for ayla to invent the wheel and is anyone else as irritated as i am by the constant capitalized spellings for nearly every activity from ceremonies to having sex seriously i can guess why auel is constantly rehashing material from earlier books to hide the lack of a story or interesting new characters and i had particularly looked forward to meeting zelandoni the previous great love of jondalar life for an entertaining and far quicker read on the subject of stone age life read joan wolf trilogy daughter of the red deer the horsemasters the reindeer hunters i have recently reread the book and while still giving only two stars i must say that it reads faster the second time around maybe because of knowing which segments to skip over altogether,0
i wish it was longer i just finished it and i have got a great big smile on my face it starts out slow but by the end you want more thats half the fun imagining what will be next if your the earthy type this series is a must read my all time favorite set of books get the series and set off on the adventure of a lifetime if the next one is truely the last please please make it twice as long,1
would the real jean auel stand up would the real jean auel stand up this book the shelters of stone seems like the author had three people read the other books in this series and then had them each pen the chapters it is a great drop below her other books no real finality to the problems that were introduced in the last book and with the new problems introduced in this book the reader is left with a sense of loss no closure to ayla pain about durc no meeting among the clan and the zelandonii ayla has to be able to strut her stuff for the good of her new people,0
ayla is like a prehistoric mcgyver this book is tiresome took real effort to read it all the way to the end i was very much looking forward to this book which turned out to be a real snore by the end of the first hundred pages i felt like ayla was a prehistoric mcgyver good grief the needle bow and arrow etc i wondering how it was she did not invent electricity wait no that was ben franklin the effort to get to the end of definitely not worth it,0
ties up loose ends i gave it five stars because i liked it i considered giving it four stars because i do not think this book will hold much for a person who has not read the previous books in the series it ties up loose ends and sets up an interest for upcoming adventures but it does not carry a lot of excitement of its own obstacles are too easily overcome this book works well as a step in a larger series but i do not think it could stand on its own,1
classic read this book and it was the same as the movie or the series that i saw a good read from cover to cover,1
love it i read this for the first time about NUMBER years ago and when the books free this book and the books after it were great lousia may alcott made NUMBER girls that seem real NUMBER girls with problems that girls have now i especially loved the bond that the march family had how happy they were when their father came home wonderful book NUMBER stars,1
grosset dunlap illustrated jr library ed i am sure there are plenty of reviews on the actual story so i will just comment on this particular edition of little women i am referring to the grosset dunlap illustrated junior library edition i found this at a local borders and was immediately attracted to the cover illustration this is a beautiful book there are many illustrations throughout the book both in color and in back and white the majority are in black and white when i looked it up on amazon i was a little hesitant about buying this book because i had read reviews stating that it only contained the first half of the story NUMBER pages the book i bought at borders contains the entire story NUMBER pages so if you like the appearance of this particular edition but are put off by the lack of the second half it is available with the complete story just be careful when making your selection,1
little women i found this version to be very trite and the voices did not match the depth of the characters i was quite disappointed compared with other audiobooks that i have listened to,0
wonderful book very tasteless introduction the book was absolutely wonderful but the introduction was written in very bad taste the insinuations were offensive and with out just cause had i read the introduction before i purchased the book i would have chosen another copy i had purchased it and then read the introduction so as i write the pages have been cut out of this book louisa may alcott did not deserve the insinuations from this person,1
this was a really good book and was very interesting this book was a wonderful story which was very similar to real life i liked the romance in the story and how there was a little sadness in the book as well this book was also definately worth reading even though it was long the text in the story was extremely descriptive and the whole plot of the story is definately NUMBER for a lot of the books that i have read it was a book that was hard to put down with all the struggles and problems the characters overcame in it i advise mostly everyone to read this book because it is pretty easy to read and you seem too be done not long after you have started by slg jdg,1
greaaaaaat book you will never want to put it down louisa may alcott weaves a wonderful and touching tale about the march sisters amy meg beth and jo the way she describes it tells the story has a touch of old fashioned charm in it taking one back to the days of long gowns bonnets rich lords and ladies and the such the four sisters personalities are also vividly described in louisa alcott eyes,1
it only the first half of the book i bought this book as a gift to impress the receiver to my shock the receiver told me the book was very nice indeed but it contained only the first half of the book i did not see anywhere where we are told about this being only half of the book unless you include the library journal description,0
good book this book is an old favorite love the old movie and loved re reading about simpler times comforting and enjoyable easy reading with some funny times happy sad and is good to get lost in am sight impaired and have not long had my kindle it is fantastic amozon have been great and easy to use this book was one of my first and i am really enjoying the story of the march family their ups and down and will look forward to reading the next in the series,1
a story about four girls who change their whole lives a brilliant book of true lives of great hopes and tragedies a story someone has to read till the end,1

a great book this is a great book i was thrilled to find it at my library because everyone told me that i should read it this unique story shows how the march sisters deal with problems together i have two sisters so i can relate to that the four girls meg jo beth and amy form a tight bond as they deal with frienships money marriages and much more during the civil war when their father is away when their mother marmee goes to help their sick father they struggle to find any help for amy who is dreadfully ill with the scarlet fever this and many more problems fill their lives and they learn to live a better life as they mature and grow strong within each other this is a wonderful classic and i encourage you to read the book watch the movie or listen to the cassete of which i have done all three,0
compact durable i received my first of these flashlights as a gift after it was stolen out of my truck i bought two more it is compact and durable the xenon light is very bright and the leds provide a good close distance flood light the best features are the compactness and light options the negative aspects are the special battery requirements and the weight i still like this flashlight better than the maglite,1
good overview this book gives to a foreign lawyer who represents customers of securities dealers a good overview of the american securities dealers law and the procedures his clients have to go through,1
enjoyable family movie i had never read or even heard of the book so i was able to approach this movie with no bias at all i found the movie to be pleasant and enjoyable the roles were all convincingly played and i found myself really mad at the scott wilson character judd travers wilson did a great job at being a despicable villain the other major and supporting roles are well cast and played by seasoned actors and actresses which contribute to the overall ambience of the movie blake heron plays the part of marty preston our stories hero and is convincing as the young lad who falls in love with a dog the dog is in trouble and turns to marty for help marty reacts to the need and decides the dog is his responsibility that decision is the beginning of marty time of testing that will lead to an ending that will not disappoint this is a first class family movie and one the entire family will enjoy,1
a bad film adaptation of a great book it really is sad to see phills reynold naylor great masterpiece about a beagle puppy trampled on like this this film was not at all faithful to the book the first difference is that in the book shiloh had a black spot just behind his left ear about one inch in front of his leg in the movie the spot is way over on his back in the book shiloh tail was a couple inches long in the movie it like a foot the classic this little piggy goes to market scene has been ommitted and scene where shiloh tries to hump the kid leg was just plain unneccesary this is supposed to be a family movie avoid this and read the fantastic book trilogy instead which i also wrote a comprehensive review for,0
very good but does not follow book we loved the movie very much my NUMBER and NUMBER year old girls loved it especially the ending we did not find it too scary at all however both my NUMBER year old and i enjoyed the book far more it gave such a deeper insight into marty heart and into the world of a boy and his dog we were both very affected by the book it made an impression on us that the movie did not i especially did not like the addition of another child a girl into the story it seemed hollywood wanted to add a little childhood flirting to make the movie more sellable that just served as a distraction from this fine story there were many differences from the book but this was the one that irked me it still was a very good movie with a heartwarming ending if you have not read the book you will like it even more cause you will not be comparing differences,1
awful book cover and content when you first see this book you figure well the content has to be better than the cover as amazing as it might sound the content is even worse the amount of errors really baffled me and stressed me out trying to look up things and the entire layout is just awful how awful books like this get published is beyond my knowledge perhaps someone lost a bet or schiller owns their soul maybe if your a NUMBER player this would help you break NUMBER if your getting this book thinking your going to be able to defend d NUMBER i guess your going to have to find out the hard way how shoddy this book is a bad chess player that writes awful books is a scary thing i think ken smith and schiller should start their own club donate your money to a good charity or buy yourself something worth having the only use this book has is the hope of being burned when no logs are left,0
a century in the life of the hog clearly a grand advertisement a fine way to take a peek at the transformation of the hog along the way you will catch glimpses of both ten decades of advertising dressage styles if you are expecting to see the development of the mystique we have come to associate with the hog you will be disappointed for those who make the hog are not necessarily those with whom it is associated i do not think i have seen so many squeaky clean carefree people up close sans helmets too actually a fascinating book certainly one any lover of motorbikes the open road social styles will enjoy,1
a classic in pristine condition the problem with old esp foreign film is that it can be hard to find good editions classics like this which have already survived the test of time tend to get picked up by two bit distributors and released in the most disgraceful of manners thank god for the criterion collection this lavish transfer will not disappoint those with a healthy aesthetic reading a lot of the other reviews i have noticed that they have mentioned something about the sound quality it true even in the newly restored edition there are some imperfections but i do not think that is enough to merit less than NUMBER stars maybe NUMBER NUMBER but that not an option,1
much cheaper at target i have not even taken this out of the box yet but i got it at target for NUMBER this item is definitely overpriced,1
ax genrich super session germanofon at one time the insanely rare NUMBER solo effort by the original guru guru guitarist NUMBER but some of us might already have this lp on another title it included on the admission to music pressing of ax genrich NUMBER see my review tunes that make this title a keeper are tripping der platzhirsch super normal rider a national affair and the quirky acid drops and sweet wine line up ax genrich guitar vocals hellmut hattler kraan bass vocals dieter moebius synthesizer fellow guru guru member mani neumeier percussion peter wolfbrandt kraan guitar and jan pride drums did not even know about this particular reissue until recently a must have,1
great play i strongly recommend this play it a powerful piece and especially great for women to use as cuttings for auditions,1
louder than a diesel engin the pump sounded like a good deal sounded is the word that needs to be taken into account here i bought the pump for a reef aquarium before i installed the pump all i could here was the trickle of water from the other pumps turned this one on and i thought i was in the middle of the freeway loud other reviewers had said it was loud i should have listened i will be returning it this week hyperflow it should be named hypersound,0
in times of trial cheryl brodersen is a gifted teacher she candid humorous and real i would say she has both her parents chuck and kay smith gifts of exhortation and teaching speaking from her heart she helps you find god grace in and through your trials,1
agree with other reviews does not last long overall i liked the case but as two people previous to myself pointed out the belt clip falls out too easily within two weeks of purchase the soft leather that was supposed to hold the plastic tab in place had stretched to the point where it was freely rotating after less then two months it plastic tab falls out entirely dropping the phone to the ground at inconvenient moments it looks like i will be looking for another case again,0
read vicsarjoo review more entertaining than the film i could hardly believe this film was being high listed for possible dvd release during the amazon com voting let us be honest it is not that good a movie neither acting nor plot nor cinematography unless you have an intense need to see some gymnastics and kurt thomas but do make a point of reading vicsarjoo review for a delicious satire of over blown and mis guided reviews if you enjoy that review one of my favorites there are some other classics by him if you link to his other reviews though some seem a little half hearted compared to this review by him cannibal women in the avocado jungle of death is another fine example of his dry wit thank you vicsarjoo for making me smile,0
excellent finally such an amazing movie appears on dvd it is no wonder ingrid bergman won the academy award for this film she is spectacular as an abused wife driven mad by her husband the only reason i gave it NUMBER stars is because you can get it cheaper somewhere else the actual publisher list price is NUMBER NUMBER and i am not entirely sure why amazon offers it for almost NUMBER more this is the same with the masterpiece edition alice in wonderland amazon lists the price as NUMBER NUMBER but in stores the list price is NUMBER NUMBER curiouser and curiouser,1
absolutely mesmerizing i bought this movie based on a recommendation made to me years ago that i had completely forgotten what a waste of time i have not seen a movie this engrossing in many many years the acting is superb and you just can not believe what you are seeing or take your eyes from it in the age of eyes wide shut and similar movies where sex is used so freely to capture your attention it is refreshing to see pure acting and story telling keep your eyes wide open and fixed on the movie highly recommended,1
interesting this is a very interesting movie considering that now the term gaslight is being used to describe a form of abuse i had never known what it was until a friend mentioned it a while back and then another friend recently mentioned this movie i was delighted to watch it here on amazon and do love the old black and white movies the setting is so wonderfully done the acting is marvelous this is overall a good movie to watch regardless of the form of abuse and message being sent across,1
incredibly stupid film this film really made me angry and pissed off i bothered watching it the characters were cardboard and i can not believe ingrid bergman starred in this junk the main character totally lost it believing all what her husband was saying about her she was totally unthinking in the whole episode until it was revealed that her husband was a con,0
i have to say this there are already over twenty reviews of this movie at this site but i had to put my two cents worth in gaslight is the earliest of bergman works i have seen we know from studies on facial expression and nonverbal communication that the face is difficult to read because of the rapidity of movement of the many features of the face eyes mouth checks chin but i swear watching this film makes me believe that bergman could command the movement of her hair folicles and skin pores there are facial movements in this film that absolutely can not be seen with the naked eye it appears that she has not moved a muscle yet she has conveyed a powerful emotion that why bergman must be in the top ten actresses of all times the story was good but watching ingrid was superb,1
you know what they say about sequels i loved the list of NUMBER but this book pales next to it and is a disappointment the characters and story are good but sparks fall from grace and the things he does during it are disappointing and i think unnecessary to the story it takes away from his lustre as being the inspiration for sherlock holmes this is not a book i will read again,0
big disappointment i thought the author could not do worse than his job with the list of NUMBER how wrong i was the NUMBER messiahs is an endless stream of predictable moments and horrible plot development characters and situations seemed trite and confusing and the last part of the novel was a complete waste i still believe frost has the potential for great exciting fiction but somehow he fails to deliver,0
save your money this isnt a repair manual i own dozens of haynes and chilton manuals and they actually show you how to service something this book goes over nothing it gives very basic info that does not help you at all i was working on a NUMBER yr old duetz and it had a few pages on NUMBER models but no spec sheet or repair info on anything i ended up having to pay someone to service it because i could not track down specs and apparently neither could the author of this book waste of money,0
the best clarke you will probably never read this book is out of print and pretty hard to find but if you ever come across a copy of it i highly reccommend you pick it up it is a masterpiece of speculative essays in it clarke accurately predicts many things of course lots of things about space and satellite communications and even an accurate description of the internet also of note are essays on what we should do if we have contact with an alien race a debunking of ufo sightings much needed a debunking of the cliche nothing is impossible with a listing of things that are much talk on the speed of light and relativity and of course a lot about space the two most interesting essays in my view are one that speculates on what the star of bethleham clarke settles on a supernova also there is the short essay god and einstein which is one of the most thought provoking things i have ever read in my life highly reccommended,1
a beautiful song i got i hope you dance for my eight year old who is a dancer she looks so sweet dancing to it it is a beautiful song i also got a song for my son for my mother groom dance with my son at his wedding in june i love this song too thanks to some great writers and singers both my children have a special song from me,1
disappointed i bought this album just for the hope you dance song that i liked so much on the radio i was very disappointed to find the song had been with somebody called the sons of the desert whoever they are it detracted so much from the original that i returned the album,0
it is a necessity for anyone over NUMBER this is a workbook for both those comtemplating death or planning for it as an eventuality it is also an instructional book on various methods of dealing with property so that one wishes are fulfilled after death even young adults should have this to help parents or friends deal with loved ones with fatal or potential fatal diseases,1
me quede aterrada con ese final isabel allende tiene una forma unica y peculiar de escribir me gustan mucho sus libros pero tiene un problema da demasiados detalles y se sale de la trama esta era una fantastica historia sin embargo no le dio la importancia que debio darle al personaje se intereso mas en describir la vida en chile y otras cosas que le restaban importancia a lo que verdaderamente la tenia la historia de eliza no es que no me haya gustado si me gusto pero el final es algo tragico e inesperado me quede con las ganas de saber que paso despues se habra quedado con se habra reconciliado con miss rose eso nunca lo vamos a saber,0
no es tan buena esta novela es entretenida pero definitivamente no es el mejor trabajo de isabel allende el final no deja mucho que decir mi recomendaci n es que lean otras novelas de isabel allende como la casa de los espiritus que es mucho mejor que sta,0

great magazine we love this magazine my husband and i are planning a move to maine and this magazine is a fun read for us,1
excellent book great examples this book covers almost every aspect of exchange that you will need to pass it also has study questions that are almost identical to the ones that you will encounter on the test the cbt that comes with the book is useless though,1
good book with detail information this study guide not only lets me pass the exchange NUMBER NUMBER exam but she provides a very useful information about the exchange NUMBER NUMBER in which i can not find from other mcse books i quite enjoy to study the chapter NUMBER managing an exchange environment and chapter NUMBER migrating to exchange whatever you choose this book for exam or knowledge that a good choice,1
hangman diary with a vigorous style franz schmidt diary is written in a pity vigorous style which probably reflects the way he went about his unenviable business the supporting material is just what is needed to make us understand the world of franz schmidt,1
great features poorly built bought the yepp NUMBER online exactly a year ago and it is now broken the battery case will not shut this has happened to many other customers buyer beware however the mp NUMBER player does have nice features good sized memory NUMBER mb is alot of storage you can get about NUMBER songs with that buy the media card it cheap slick lookingthe yepp is very nice looking it is also pretty small good to exercise with remote controlits nice that they put this here but it is pretty worthless the lcd is wothless and the fm tuner on this is extremely weak voice recordergood feature in summary nice features but poorly built if you want to take a chance on the mp NUMBER player go right ahead,0
not a best buy yepp NUMBER h is nice looking but apparently only works with itunes NUMBER NUMBER or NUMBER NUMBER on the mac platform itunes is on NUMBER NUMBER with NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER being the last working version that ships with apple products it is useless to say mac compatible on a pc the unit caused my computer to crash and repairs to software loads needed to be done to recover so i was not able to get satisfaction via that route either may be a good idea to just go and get a ipod for mac or pc the buttons on the yepp are difficult to use unless you have tiny fingers the rocker switch slips and it easy to depress the play function while rocking confusing your input the remote is cool though the fm tuner worked medium well,0

no one did it better in my opinion charles dickens remains the writer who defined the art of characterization in the NUMBER th century this novel contains a bevy of characters that the readers will find unforgettable the haunting figure of miss havisham has stayed with me since my NUMBER th grade literature class almost NUMBER years ago and my recent rereading of the novel brought her horrid existence into full view again the plot has twists and turns and although i found myself having to stop reading and letting certain episodes sink into my understanding the beauty and scope of the writing is truly remarkable as a young student of dickens i resisted the long descriptions and difficult dialogue and i do not remember loving the book when i read it the first time as an adult however my admiration for the novel is undeniable,1
a very true side of human nature charles dickens novel great expectations explores the side of human nature that many do not like to read in novels in the united states in the NUMBER st century people would rather read about romantic style plots where all turns out well for the protagonists dickens however chooses to illuminate what man can really be capable of betrayal duplicity unfaithfulness and a handful of other negative characteristics definitely an interesting novel great expectations will undoubtedly have its audience intrigued and constantly pondering i would highly recommend this masterpiece,1
enjoyed it more now than in high school get characters all kinds of emotional confrontations some things would be politically incorrect now loved it nice break from some of the thrown together single topic stories i have read recently,1
in repsonse to a reader from st louis mo you said no one who is still is high school will understand this book that is not entirely true i am in seventh grade i not only loved the book i understood it too i have done character analyses for instance bentley drummle had a troubled childhood and critisized pip character my mom insists that he a loser but then again she never did have that much insight into character the poor guy is in love so he can hardly see straight anyway i do not pretend that i am average because i am not but i enjoyed it and understood it,1
did not live up to my expectations i had to read this book this year for my english class at first i was interested when pip was a child but i quickly became sick and tired of it boring nature i am in the honors program in my school and we only had about NUMBER and a half weeks to read it but it seemed like NUMBER and a half years i was disappointed most because this massive plot builds up and i was waiting for something to happen but nothing really did furthermore it was a bit hard to understand especially since my mind was drifting becuase it is hard to pay attention to this book,0
a deeper pip worth re reading as an adult this was mandatory reading in middle school nobody of that age could get the full story with all its nuances at that age it like reading a new book what a wordsmith charles dickens was,1
you can never go wrong with dickens how nice to reread an old classic as an adult instead of in the classroom a wonderful novel of pip who comes into his great expectations via an unknown benefactor who he believes to be miss havisham we see how the influence of money and position affect pip relations with his family and former neighbors and not necessarily for the better there are lots of surprise twists and turns in the plot especially about miss havisham and her adopted daughter estella and her true parentage as always a dickens novel is peopled with wonderful and unusual characters that eventually all play a part in telling the story i understand that there were two endings of this book published the version i read had only one ending and i do not know which one it was i will have to search out another version of this book to see which i liked best,1
bo ring this book by far is the worst piece of shi garbage i have ever laid my eyes on the story has a skeleton and a little bit of meat and i like meat but mostly it just fat especially the second stage of pip expectations which finds pip devoid of any characterizations beyond i am rich and you are not and oh how i do love the lady estella it enough to make you vomit mr dickens should have made this a much shorter novel or maybe even a short story it still would have been boring but maybe not as boring,0
long winded excruciating to read and finish i had to read this for a high school summer reading list it was the worst reading experience i ever had and i love reading books i cried several times trying to plug through the long winded obviously dickens paid by the word presentation while some themes are mildly interesting there were no scenes that captured my attention or held it for any period of time this book might be great as an adult which i will gladly never know but definitely not as a NUMBER year old sucks sucks sucks note to teachers and principals please do not assign this to your high school students there are so many better and more captivating books this was the first book i ever read that truly took the joy out of reading for me,0
ever the best of friends this book and i are i had to keep reminding myself that this story was fiction otherwise i probably would have gotten much more emotional about it than i did many of the emotions pip went through i have also at some point what does not kill you makes you stronger or at least very sick poor pip,1
classical literature great expectations was the greatest book that i have ever read the way that the book was put together always left you wanting to know more the book was told by a young boy named phillip pirrup that falls madly in love with a young lady name estrella he ends up being sent away to england to become a young gentleman and strays away from the love of his life a great deal of scandal goes on and if i tell you anymore than you will know what happens but i will tell you this if you like a dramatic sope opera filled with love suspense and action than you will find this book astounding i can tell you i loved this bok and i am sure you will too,1
great book i had to read this for my ap english class at first it did not catch my attention but to my english teacher urging mrs brodmerkel i read on actually if she was not there to explain each chapter after we had read it it would not have been as good this was a great book and i think everyone should have to read it there are so many different social conditions that still pertain to life today dickens does well in making this novel timeless,1
the book was kind of confusing but the idea was great it took me a little while to get into the story and get to know all the characters but once i did i could not put the book down charles dickens is a wonderful writer and great expectations prooved it,1
overrated worthless and so very boring this book reminds me of algebra its boring time consuming worthless and you will never have to use this in your whole life never so when you are teacher asks you to read this book do not do it read the cliff notes or watch the wishbone version,0
long entertaining dickens story for the car i listened to the unabridged audio tape version of this book narrated by michael page it one of those deals where you listen to each tape entirely on the left channel then play the whole tape again on the right channel to get the next part of the story which is kind of awkward since you forget which channel you were on if you also use your stereo for music but these editions are probably the least expensive by the hour audio tapes you can buy i think dickens tendency toward exhaustive descriptions works a lot better when you are listening to it in the car than when you are reading it in print i might never have had the patience to read the actual book while sitting in a chair but listening to it in the car was pretty entertaining colorful characters humor suspense unexpected plot twists i can picture a lot of it in my mind even now a recommended story,1
still a classic do not waste the classics on kids i remember having to read and write book reports on musty old classic books in school dull and boring now i am ready to enjoy these books great expectations shows how much of our lives are lived on incomplete information the hero assumes that he knows who is guiding and helping him to live and grow beyound his simple beginnings only to discover at the end that nothing he assumed was true the hero does live up to the expectations of his benefactor and beyond the expectations of many others he also finds out what it is to be given a better future and how much you owe to those that believe in you i enjoyed this story and recomend you read reread this enlighting story of growing up,1
beyond my expectations i know for sure now why charles dickens is such a famous author for works other than a christmas carol the reputation of the book and the author speak for themselves i was overwhelmed with the quality of dickens writing the intricate nuances of the plot and the many surprise twists the illustrations in the book plus the alternate ending were also bonuses i could not be more complimentary of this book and plan to read many more dickens works starting with david copperfield great expectations is now one of my favorite books of all time,1
profoundly worthless just think of all the trees cut down to make all the additions of this classicly boring novel this ranks with catch NUMBER and huckleberry fin as one of the worst novels yet published in the english language was there a plot no do not kid yourself the fool author made it up as he went along not caring if it made sense or if the characters had any meaning i hate this novel with a passion so great it scares even me i like to see all copies burned okay not really that a little extreme but at least take this garbage out of school curriculums its making us stupid making us believe pip world is what the world really is pip if a fool that got dumped too many times and where the sex was dickens scared of it i believe that all great novels should have sex in them it brings some humanity to them great expectations is a fantasy on level with the bible but worse tragicly worse,0
finally some clarity i have a pile of xml books on my desk they all seem to assume too much or assume to little those written at my level appear to be written with the stream of consciousness approach to technical authoring this book is a breath of fresh air as a novice with only a basic understanding of xml i jumped right into the chapter on schemas and felt i had a very strong grasp of it in just an evening every topic was explained with clarity and yet it did not seem too slow or dull the code samples included line by line explanations if i got it just by looking at the sample i could move on otherwise the explanations were there to illuminate the sample for me the review and exercises at the end of each chapter follow the collegiate textbook formula why is it a formula because it works what a sense of accomplishment to get to the end and be able to answer the questions and perform the suggested exercises,1
other reviewers must work for the author the book does not show a user how to use the lang in a real world environment the examples in the book are to simple for the user to understand how to transfer the in to something a user can use,0
sorprendente y entretenido me record aquellos libros de la generaci n kronen un libro muy pop donde ha calado el lenguaje cinematogr fico para presentar la trama personajes bien definidos un libro entre yorkshire y la nostalgia del levante espa ol sorprendente y entretenido,1
hi i ordered this movie off of amazon NUMBER months ago because my uncle in lebanon wanted it so i ordered it a month and a half in advance and i still have not gotten it this is horrible,0
eliminates rusty bolt freeze up i started using this on the recommendation of a sports car mechanic lug nuts i then started using it on anything that was going to be exposed the the weather now things like spark plugs head bolts license plate bolts etc it always works the bolts come off w o a breaker bar but never comes loose either i have been using it for about NUMBER years now and it has never caused any kind of problem except maybe the silver colored product itself is hard to wipe off of your hands and work clothes actually that is a plus i know it will stay where i put it not leak out under heat or pressure all of my friends now have a tube in their workshop i see them using it everywhere it is cheap enough and solves tons of problems get a tube yourself you will never regret it,1
great shorts very comfortable and durable shorts i bought several pair of these shorts and wear them constantly i recommend them highly,1
you can find better there are better shorts out there these felt rough not soft or comfy and too heavy the waistband was not smooth and was distinctly uncomfortable with a backpack on,0
this one is the perfect afternoon read the story princess by rebecca winters harlequin romance NUMBER november NUMBER what a charming love story i was enchanted from the very first pages when we are introduced to peter and michael wolfe fans of the story princess and to their cynical father who warns them when they enter a contest to meet her that she probably does not even like children in real life domini aka story princess is not at all what jared expects but he insists on interpreting her words and actions to fit his picture of who he thinks she is the boys were delightfully portrayed and domini and jared undeniable attraction and very human insecurities made their journey to a hea such a satisfying one this one is the perfect afternoon read,1
no problems the material was as described and was delivered on schedule the packaging was less than adequate since the bar broke through one end cap of the shipping tube otherwise it would be five stars,1
different being a person who enjoys the sound of trance but not necessarily a fan of it i thought i knew what this album was going to sound like but it was not even that of which i thought expecting a fast paced and heavy techno sound such as from paul oakenfold tranceport the album was very different sasha experiments with all sorts of sounds and many different tempos and emulates the sounds of heavy trance as well as slower paced techno beats like you would hear from the crystal method or paul oakefold ibiza this album dips through the sounds of trance pop big beat and even a slow trip hop beat in mr tiddles airdrawndagger is one of the most diverse albums that i have heard is the trance dance genre and no trance or dance fan should be without it i give it NUMBER stars,1
this is quite oddly yet deservingly perfection i have been listening to trance for NUMBER years now to be truthful over the last year i have started to lose my aggresive stance on trance and its success it has let me down quite a lot lately sasha got me with this one he starts with a magnificent intro song that completely brings you into the album from the start he holds the bass that you are craving off for the first NUMBER songs and it is well worth the wait it all so perfect in the way that he manages his sounds bringing you up with any one sound and holding it until you can not take it anymore and then adding just at the right moment either a kickass breakbeat or another airy keyboard that is completely unique sasha is good once again in my book this is definitely one of my favorite trance albums of the past year and a half,1
profound i bought this cd blindly just because i needed something to listen to and i am amazed one word descibes this cd profound it definitely strays away from sasha normal groove and i hope he can keep this up this is a beautiful cd,1
disappointed been looking for this movie for a long time and i really was happy for have gotten it what happened was that at place them in my dvd the disappointment was that the film was poorly recorded es mas can not be viewed say no more movies buy me ubiece least liked that before sending the revised ubiecen,0
a classic this is one of my favorite movies and i was so happy to find it on here for sale it not only has the dvd but also special features the movie quality is great for the date of production would definitely recommend this movie,1
truly a classic this movie came out when i was NUMBER and it been a fixture it my movie collection ever since there are so many memorable moments some filled with sheer hilarity others that are quite touching the acting is great the story is good and this is by far one of my all time favorite performances from tom hanks in addition to the immortal line there no crying in baseball there is a large selection of quotable moments from many different characters i am not even a big baseball fan but for some reason i have always loved baseball movies perhaps there is an innate fun and big hearted nature to the sport when you use it as subject matter to frame a story films like this and sandlot and field of dreams and rookie of the year have always had special places in my memory because of the fun and humor they inspired,1
one of the best movies this is one of the best movies ever the cast stands out in this movie about a women baseball leaue during ww NUMBER tom hanks usually gets top billing in this movie but the top billing should go to gena davis and lori petty who play the sisters that the movie is based around,1
a must read for any ladakh traveler ladakh is an unbelievable spot very unique although almost NUMBER years old this book has not lost any of its magic and relevancy it helped me understand ladakh and its buddhism better,1
i like to thank the academy this album features a large english chorus singing traditional christmas songs songs are sung not just in english but also in french and german it certainly well sung but it pretty boring to my ears most of the songs do not have that much energy other than the bombastic hark the herald angels sing but fans of classical music will probably enjoy it more than me,0
plastic taste we tried everything to get rid of the plastic taste we ran through plain water coffee baking soda vinegar all told we ran through at least NUMBER cups it still tastes like plastic i am thinking plastic infused water is not good for us also my husband is taking it back to costco this morning,0
the keurig special edition model is not recommended the special edition model is not recommended i recently purchased the special edition model as a replacement to my single serve tassimo i changed because my favorite starbucks single serve coffee changed from the tassimo to the keurig well after about NUMBER weeks of using the keurig i have found that the special edition keurig is poorly designed the water container is a joke even with the larger NUMBER oz container it is so oddly shaped that it is difficult to remove and impossible to replace on the unit without spilling some of the water in addition it seems like every cup of coffee tastes about the same this was not the case with my old tassimo i have tried a few brands provided in the assortment pack and like the starbucks coffees however all the starbucks coffees taste the same and even different brand coffees all taste about the same very very disappointed,0
great product great service thanks kathy i had an issue with my b NUMBER and keurig was absolutely great about resolving my problem thank you kathy in customer service i did not realize that my water is very hard and combined with my low use of the machine it naturally caused build up on the sensor this wouldnt have happened if filtered water was used or the hard tap water did not sit in the container for several days at a time building up mineral deposits which was my fault for doing not a product issue but keurig kathy was really super about taking care of this for me i have had a great experience with keurig and the b NUMBER product and will say their customer service is fantastic,0
perfect for the reckless consumer we had this machine at work and made maybe NUMBER cups a day on a busy day within a month the machine broke keurig did replace it right away but then the second broke as well a co worker bought one for his home and had the same problem they gave us an upgrade on the model and this one is still going the coffee was good but the tea was not most importantly people is it is wasteful with little plastic cups filling up the garbage and in our case two machines in the dump come on people lets have some conscious comsumerism and slow down what ever happened to putting the coffee in a paper filter and pouring hot water over it and letting the fragrance wrap around you if you are that busy and needy for coffee instantly maybe you should be looking at the job ads or self help books and not over priced hunks of wasteful plastic for greedy americans,0
floating pieces of black plastic after having the keurig for one year the plastic lip inside where the coffee pod sits completely broke in several different pieces and landed in my coffee cup three friends of mine had the same thing happen after having the keurig for a short time it seems the heat from the keurig eventually weakens this piece and makes it brittle enough to break apart,0
shrunken version of original is way too small the original much larger version of this bible is excellent however this printing is way smaller the text is so small it barely readable my NUMBER year old who is used to the other version started crying and needs a magnifying glass to read the text get the original much larger version if you can,0
illustrated children bible this is a great illustrated children bible my only complaint is that the font is extremely tiny,1
shocking small unreadable text waste of money waste of money i had no idea that this book was a pocket edition that is unreadable i wish i had read through all the reviews before i purchased this item the book is tiny and the font size is ridiculous i would return it but would cost me more to return than to just throw it in the bin really disappointed with this seller not informing buyers more clearly obviously a lot of people have the same opinion as me and would like amazon to do something about it if they can so others are not ripped off i have used the larger book for quite a while and it is an excellent book that you can actually read unlike this one,0
way too small with the price i naturally assumed this book would be a typical size hard back book however it is just slightly larger than a pocket size the print is ridiculously small and i have perfect eye sight not at all pleased with this purchase,0
disappointing although the text is wonderful the print is so small that a child can not read it actually it difficult for adults as well there is a larger book children illustrated bible that is sooo much better however on amazon i could not exchange this book buyer beware,0
very small print for the young eyes if you are thinking of purchasing this bible spend the extra money and purchase the larger book this one is a nice personal size but the print is so small it is hard to read i bought it for my granddaughter who told me it hurt her eyes to read it,0
fonts are too small for children to read my children love the content but i can not let them read the book for too long double the size of the font and print it in a larger format would be better,0
children illustrated bible i bought this book for my NUMBER yearold grandson and did not even give it to him the book appears to be miniaturized the print is so tiny that many people would not be able to read it without magnifying glasses it is not appropriate for children given this tiny print the pictures are well done and it would have been a perfect gift if the print were not so small,0
her best record to date davis really shines here her first two records were commendable in their artistic integrity production values and market risks but this record really nails down what she does well sings the arrangements are stellar and the layers and twists really showcase her composition skills her singing is rugged and compelling and if the lyrical content is any indication this is clearly her sade record somebody must have broken her heart and the listeners get to benefit from the raw emotion that shines through from her experiences she channels all of her previous potential influences and the freedom that running her own label affords and comes out with a stellar record,1
foods just another mainstream american cookbook with the words foods heading the title i expected to find whole foods vegetarian dishes and low fat recipes i did not this cook book is exactly like every mainstream american cookbook i have encountered it is full of meat recipes only NUMBER recipes made it into the vegetable section in addition there are ingredients called for such as mushrooms onion soup mix and cream of mushroom soup one sauce recipe for a meat dish called for a half pound of butter i am not what i consider to be a health nut but this book fell far short of my expectations i could not find a publication date so i am assuming that this book was written before there was clear health information on eating whole low fat foods,0
tiffany ortiz review this was a refreshing book i thought it was written with great insight the ending was a change from the typical happy ending the characters seemed real not fictional i liked that your evil character virgil had more than one personality trait thank you for having a conference call on a saturday morning that was really gracious of you to do that thank you for writing this wonderful book i can not wait to read any other books you write,1
a look into a complicated man this book brings you into a thinking mode while entertaining you a capable man who can make practical reality based decisions whodeclines to take control or make things happen in his personal life a man who reacts rather than acts through most of his life it is also introspective of a man view on loss i truly felt this was a thinking feeling person book all the more remarkable for a first novel writer even though an experienced writer looking forward to the next book from this writer who shows a brilliant future entertaining emotional and educational what a combination patt gronick,1
waiting for the world to end review waiting for the world to end to me was a very interesting novel i thought that the book was a lot different from other books i have read in the past the ending was not what i had expected but it was unique waiting for the world to end related to real life situations and controversial issues the book showed that not everyone is perfect and everyone does make bad decisions in their lives the book gave me faith and let me know that when life is bad to just hang in there,1
review i had neutral feelings torwards this book i did not hate it but i did not like it i thought the book was rather boring and was hard for me to get into i did like how the story was easy to understand and follow i do like that about books i did not like how the book ended in all the book was not bad but it was not my kind of book i would chose to read,0
imagination when i read a book i do not choose to keep trying to use my imagination i prefer the author to take me somewhere and i did not feel much for this book,0
waiting for this book to end the dialogue in this novel is as stilted and ridiculous as its characters here the premise a grown man with a successful career in education meets the mother of one of his students and after a few seconds he madly and deeply in love the dilemma on which the rest of the plot depends i was expecting the main character to metamorphse into a serial killer but it does not happen this book is not worth anyone time it author obviously thought writing a good book was not worth her time and it definitely not worth yours,0
works ok i personally like this but it dries too fast i constantly need to reapply this after a few minutes the feel of this is pretty nice and the consistency is a little thick but overall i thought this was pretty good,1
very satisfied dvd movie was as promised very satisfied thank you saw this movie ages ago when it came out still very good,1
an excellent tale of the military good and bad i first read this book many years ago and have reread it several times since through my time at west point in the infantry and special forces now that i am retired i can safely say the characters rnig true to include the bad ones i recommend a couple of other books about the military if you are interested andy mcnabb sas books which are NUMBER bestsellers in england and an excellent view into special operations the sas was not that much different than sf closer to home i have enjoyed bob mayer special forces series wish they were all in print as i had wished for years they resissue this book but you can get some here at amazon,1
a dissppointment our neighbor across the street has a little girl with downs syndrome and my daugther who is NUMBER has started to notice that she is different from her i wanted to get her a book that showed someone with downs syndrome doing real things so that i could use it as an example unfortuntately the pictures are so far away that you do not really get to see russ it would have been better if there were some closer photographs,0
easy and useful i have these in the corner of my daughters nursery with various little things on them vase of flowers framed photos my first mother day card and they are nice and strong i painted them the color of her accent wall and they really pop they paint easily and install even easier a good purchase would be great in a bathroom to keep little necessities at hand,1
problem with these discs is anyone else having issues with these discs when you first place the discs in the player it skips over the main menus then the menu button will only start and stop the episode selected but it will not return you to the main menu there is no spanish or portuguese dubbed audio on the discs despite what the menus and packaging claim and the episodes automatically play with spanish subtitles even when the subtitles are turned off the only way to avoid this is to choose other subtitles with the remote this appears to be an authoring issue as i am using a two year old sony dream system dvd player and have not had these issues with previous seasons i am exchanging my discs immediately but i have a feeling they might all be bad anyone else hear about these issues,0
a diverse determined collection mixed explores the mixed race experience and successfully dismantles so many common misconceptions about people of mixed race or cross cultural heritage it a gem that ought to be featured in high school literature courses not only for its collection of outstanding stories but for the insights its contributors shed on the realities and paradoxes of the contemporary multiracial experience,1
great cd this cd exceeded my high expectations highlights for me are the title track monasterio de sal punta umbria la nina de puerta oscura amazing and el vito but all of the songs are good i have definitely got to buy some more of his cd,1
very good but not the kick i am looking for there no doubt that green mountain dark magic k cups make extremely good cups of coffee it just that i do not think it packs that much of a punch the finest espresso k cup i have tried so far is gm espresso blend i like my extra dark coffee to have a little bitterness to it that quality makes me know that it strong and espresso blend has it dark magic is lacking that something extra i think the word sweet in the product description is the culprit here either way i still recommend these to anybody but espresso blend is the best espresso like coffee to date note i have NUMBER varieties that i have never tried coming in the mail black tiger double black diamond and revv it highly possible that one of those could unseat espresso blend can not wait to find out,1
some tropicalia in your pants i must say that if you do not hear the very intense influence of the most brilliant NUMBER tropicalia band os mutantes here you must be deaf i give them props for letting themselves be influenced by such an incredible revolutionary band of brazilian tropicalia geniuses but in the end would not you just want to listen to the mutantes buy it anyway this is not run of the mill by any means these guys much like mr kurt heasley of the lilys know the art of intelligent complicated songcraft in the sway of the fantastic sounds of the NUMBER with a slight modern twist and for a time where music was new where guitar had never been heard like that before what better than to pay homage to such an important time in pop history the wondermints do it right and you better do it right than do it at all otherwise you just look ridiculous purchase my friends,1
the gangster chronicles i remember the original nbc tv series as it started my love affair with gangster films this movie has taken all of the guts from the mini series leaving it complete flop in all regards joe penny and the rest of the cast deserve better than this butchered mess i want the original at just about any cost can someone help me find it e mail me at EMAIL thanks,0
this book may can be life changing i first was given this book to read over thirty years ago as a very young christian i could hardly put it down i was so struck by the very personal relationship david wilkerson had with god and how god led and guided him so intimatley it caused me to seek god direciton in my own persoanl life and i can honestly say changed the whole depth of my relationship with god i work with teens who are incarecerated and i recently had one of them tell me that becasue of reading this book he now believes there is a god he was struck at how god led this man so personally the kids love the book this book and run baby run which is it counterpart are a couple of the most popular books that kids check out in my little library i offer them in the detention center i highly reccomend this book it is an awesome true story,1
i thought this was going to be a live performance from kenny g instead this was just a recording with a fire place burning not what i was expecting,0
major loose end two days after i finished this i thought hey wait a minute she never explained just how the anti semite group just happened to have a knife with tara blood on it to conveniently plant in the teacher car they supposedly did not know who did it so how do they explain having the murder weapon did anyone else pick up on that and if so did she explain it anywhere,0
what an incredible letdown at first i was unable to put this book down the intriguing beginning piqued my interest and the compelling theme grabbed my attention and forced me to continue to find out what happened sloan style of writing is very skillful and her artistry is outstanding therefore my question is how come she began a book with such potential and promise and then proceeded to force on her readers such a disappointing ending it a shame because the book had so much potential too bad she wasted it on such triviality and shallowness her writing style made it very clear that she could have done much better i only recommend this book if the reader stops after the first half it better to make up your own ending than accept the author,0
captivating who dunnit keeps you guessing again and again captivating throughout though in the end i was not shocked by who did it i had figured it out almost from the beginning good twists and turns i was made to think twice more than once the characters were well developed and real this is movie material to me hmmm jimmy smits as the chief of police kyra sedgewick as our heroine i recommend the book great beach book,1
a must for art quilters an absolutely inspirational book for the art quilter who prefers the art quilt to be based on historical blocks a refreshing approach using patterns that are accurate and directions that are concise,1
not a usb headset i typed in usb headset in the search box and because this one was the cheapest i purchased it when it finally arrived i found out it was not a usb headset which was never written on the product description the sound quality is good and the mic quality was horrible,0
i did not know i owned this i love the jingle in this movie x more days till halloween halloween halloween etc and being born on halloween it is even more fun now how do i get my movie,0
this movie rocks forget about the other halloween movies this is by far the creepiest halloween movie i have seen the scenes are dark and atmospheric the moody synthesized soundtrack is truly the best i have ever heard even by today standards yes the acting and special effects could have been better but if you look at the movie for what it portrays ancient wichcraft stonehenge rituals sacrifices halloween origins end of world events etc it really deserves a place in your movie collection,1
classic horror first off i am the biggest fan of halloween of all time and i love halloween iii season of the witch it may not have michael myers in it but it still has that john carpenter innovativness and plot making it a classic the movie does have its share of blood and gore but still relies on suspense and carefully planned scares the cast may be rather low budget but still manages to pull off a good horror flick those who trashed this movie need to open their minds and realize what a classic this is i highly recommend it,1
worst movie ever this movie is discraseful it is is tasteless boring and stupid the plot is ridicilous the characters are horrible and the script is possibly the stupidest piece of s t ever written tom atkins might be the worst hero ever he plays a doctor investigating a patient murder and why the murderer lit himself on fire the res is to stupid to even bother talking about do not see it or else you will be those poor little kids having bugs and snakes coming out of your mouth p s it has nothing to do with micheal myers sorry,0
do not let the good reviews fool you this is by far the worst horror movie i have ever watched i really can not say anyting else about it it could have been good but the director did not succesfully put the story to film its worth watching once just so you say youve seen the worst horror movie ever made,0
worst movie ever this is the most horrible excuse for a movie that i have ever witnessed and i want my two hours that i wasted seeing this back,0
cool h NUMBER is a very different kind of sequel no michael myers this one has witch craft and all that sci fi stuff above average,1
loaded with special features a pretty underrated movie that would have much more acclaim if not for the halloween iii banner above the title this disc is great for collectors as the special features are top shelf two audio commentaries and a half hour retrospective documentary a solid transfer and good sound recommended for those who watch the extras,1
what are you people crazy first of all it has nothing to do with the famous michael myers searching for laurie strode jamie lee curtis series which sorry people but it is sooo not played out not too mention it the dumbest movie i have ever seen there really not much of a plot and the main actor who made out to be some sorta hottie looks like he got run over by a mack truck also i had the horrible jingle eight more days till halloween halloween halloween eight more days till halloween silver shamrock stuck in my head for like two weeks terrible,0
possibly worst movie ever this film is quite possibly the worst movie i have ever seen oh it true what a waste of time no mike myers jamie lee or the doctor why even have halloween in the title then there absolutely nothing scary here except maybe the acting and cheesy effects horrible NUMBER usda garbage,0
time to make corrections ok lets get this right out in the open for some of the other reviewers that do not know what they are talking about john carpenter had nothing to do with this movie the only one he ever had anything to do with was the orginal which by the way is by far the best of the bunch i do not really even count the others at all well maybe the second one it was not too bad as for this movie i will be honest i have never even watched it i guess i will rent it someday and see what it all about at least it does not have michael myers in it which is good cause in my opinion he died after the second movie i do think they should of changed the name of this though i mean every halloween movie has had a different director naming this one part iii does not even make any sense at all,0
wow but wow is this movie bad i really hate this movie it so bad i can barely describe it in words i despise any film that uses children as nothing more than sucker punching props to inspire sympathy when they are completely undeveloped like the rest of the characters in this trash if you really want to see what in this movie go to to see my video review of it get ready to laugh,0
wasted witch stupid piece of trash that is the black sheep of the halloween franchise because it has nothing to do with the michael myers saga after the death of a toyseller a doctor and the toyseller daughter investigate his mysterious death there snooping leads to the silver shamrock mask making company and to it owner a warlock bent on destroying the planet by way of his magical melting masks that children wear on halloween turning them into slimy snakes bugs and venomous insects universal pictures bought the rights to this turd along with halloween ii hoping to take the franchise into a different twilight zone style direction with a new halloween film supposedly coming out every season instead the studio put the series right into the toilet john carpenter wrote the music and serves as executive producer with debra hill and nick castle the shape from the original directs this piece of celluloid waste stick with the original,0
worst horror movie i have ever seen where is michael shame on moustapah akkad for naming this movie halloween if you want to see a good movie see halloween NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER and h NUMBER o skip this one,0
has not anyone got it yet i liked this movie not because it was a break from the originals but because it was what defined the series most people who criticize this movie obviously did not watch it several times over to get the whole point of it the first NUMBER movies never truly explained what the curse of michael myers was and how it came about nor did they emphasize on the history of samhain like this one did this movie attempts to explain that and halloween NUMBER curse of micheal myers finishes it up try to read more into a movie people and not be so quick to judge,1
outstanding horror movie an original this has got to be one of the greatest and underrated horrormovies i have ever seen they do not make movies like this anymore and they are hard to find this movie has all the esseintial key components for a great horror movie NUMBER mood NUMBER plot NUMBER atmosphere this movie is only for the true horror fan and this movie is well acted to a t by tom atkins great movie from the NUMBER s,1
bad i thought this would be ok but i mean not a good title people say bad title but some said it was ok but not only is it bad but bad acting bad special efects and kids were pupkins on there head stupid stupid stupid and the death scenes kids shake there heads and die and a guy trieng to take over the world bad plot,0
the award of worst movie of the century goes to this movie was okay i have it NUMBER star because it lacked in suspense and acting i am sure people would have liked it better if it never had anything to do with halloween and it was an independent movie but no the stupid writters had to install this horrible peice of junk the only reason i have this movie is because i want to have all the halloweens but i want to actually watch girlfriends or ally mcbeal while i am watching this i did not like it boring i advise you carefully watch halloween NUMBER instead i advice,0
halloween iii do not waste your time i am a fan of the haloween series of films but have never seen part iii due to eveyone i know saying its terrible after all these years i wanted to give it an objective chance and was excited to actually watch this film please note going into this film i knew michael myers has nothing to do with it and was just fine with that well this film is terrible by any standard i would classify this film more as sci fi and what a far fetched even by sci fi standards plot this was sloppy story line that does not flow horrible acting and the movie moves slow without much suspense the only question you will ask is how much longer is this movie after the first NUMBER NUMBER hour i love the idea behind doing something different with the movie besides michael myers but this one misses badly which is probably why it went back to the michael myers theme too bad believe the negitive reviews you have heard and do not waste your time,0
what witch why did they call it season of the witch there suppose to be a witch in this movie i really do not like this movie it has nothing to do with the rest of the series a factory produces masks with a computer chip installed on them that turns children heads into snakes and insects what the heck is the purpose of that this movie should be on mystery science theatre NUMBER,0
gruesome well you will not see michael myers in this sequel but it still watchable an evil maker somewhere in northern california provides young children with devilishly made pumpkin masks need i say more,0
halloween NUMBER is a classic piece of garbage halloween NUMBER is the worst horror flick ever made i would rather eat guano while sitting on thumbtacks and drinking bile while watching leprechaun in space than watch this NUMBER minute slaughter of the prestigous halloween series what was john carpenter smoking when he came up with the worst possible idea in the history of horror films if you purchase this film then you have just donated your hard earned money to foundation of crappy movies remember have a happy halloween from silver shamrock,0
why why how they could call this movie haloween i do not know i understand that was carpenters idea but it was stupid micheal myers is the coolest horror movie killer i can think of and calling this a sequal to NUMBER and NUMBER is an insult to the movies it was not even that scary and the plot was horrible even worst than nightmare on elm street and that is saying something the only thing i can think of that is good is the director but he made a terrible mistake with this movie so i give it a NUMBER star for that one factor people may say this movie is okay and stuff but a horror movie that has nothing to do with it prequels that not scary almost at all has a horrible plot and is just plain stupid is not worth calling what it is do not watch this movie maybe maybe rent it just to see why it is such a bad movie and then you can tell all your friends that you just saw a horrible movie well that all i have to say,0
charles mann NUMBER well written and fascinating my first purchase for my kindle firekindle fire full color NUMBER multi touch display wi fiwas the perfect choice mann research of indigenous people living in the americas prior to columbus arrival was thorough and his conclusions well balanced,1
good read this is an excellent book well researched a little heavy sledding in some places author does a fair job of showing where he is speculating and where he is reporting,1
good overview of pre columbian world i have not kept up with recent research in pre columbian america and this book gave alot of good information on what the recent discoveries and controversies are the information on how advanced and extensive some of the south american cultures were was good however i found myself getting a bit impatient with all the details about royal lineages who killed who etc a bit more micro focus than i expected the information on ecology and the impact of the native cultures on the landscape was very interesting it seems there should be more interchange between biologists and anthropologists the issue of what is natural and how humans fit in with the natural world has major implications for our world today,1
NUMBER by charles c mann every chapter was a revelation about the demographics of north and south america before columbus most american indian populations were agricultural with substantial population centers with running water and covered sewers unlike the european cities of that same time period the scale of the devastation caused by the introduction of european diseases particularly smallpox is so immense as to be incomprehensible the rate of fatality in the european black death episodes was NUMBER in NUMBER while that for the smallpox plagues in the americas was NUMBER in NUMBER,1
over the top i liked the author story but i can not believe all the things that he assumes for what was happening in the americas before NUMBER,1
droll and boring if you like to learn the entire hierarchy of old native american and latin american cultures than this is the book for you dispersed facts about each culture that could be interesting if tied together and actually filled the book make it worth perusing however the book is entirely too long and filled with drivel consistent with reading a list of kings for every country in europe for the last NUMBER NUMBER years information about each king would be written out and spoken as fact though when the source behind the information is given you begin forming some serious doubts about the authenticity of it all,0
book was destroyed content is great the company that sent it to me however did not mention that the book would come in two parts i was horribly dissapointed i am however a social studies teacher and i use this book all the time in my discussion of pre conquest americas,0
a must for hard house fans well i got this cd for christmas and i am extremely pleased with it i think cd NUMBER which is more hard house than trance is the better mainly for florian f surreal brazil which is a masterpiece but still i like the harder feel of this disc number NUMBER is definitely lighter and trancier but gets a bit harder towards the end although it is spoiled at the start by using too many tracks with vocals i think a definite no no in trance but even so there are some gems like moogwai viola so overall if you like stompier hard house tunes buy it and listen to cd NUMBER cd NUMBER has too many cheesy vocals for me so if you want good trance wait for the soon to be released binary finary album instead,1
NUMBER episode dvd jamie oliver original tv show is superb better than his subsequent ones the episodes on this dvd season NUMBER are chef night out hen night babysitting the band birthday party girlfriend and christmas comes early with a special feature pick a dish dish by ingredient and method,1
tent play easy to set up big enough for several kids to play in does take up a lot of room just be careful with the rods when setting it up we did get a tear overall the kids have fun playing with it it a good play tent for several kids and older kids as well,1
shine i bought shine and found that the sound was inaudibly small with maximum volume control so i complained and got a new copy which turned out to be the same for this dvd of a story of a mentally unstable genius pianist the sound is the most crucial but it failed i advise you that you should have checked the quality of sound before you put on this item for sale,0
not my kind of movie too slow not much going on i could not even finish it there was no character study no plot that i could see nothing i kept waiting for something to happen or for something to mean something or to see if there was any direction in it maybe it was just me but i do not get it,0
very nice color i bought these for my daughter to use before a dance she used NUMBER towels she said they fell apart but the color was very nice she is very fair with red hair and i thought the color looked very natural i will be using these this summer,1
tales of alhambra multiple pages missing ie blank had taken this book on vacation to spain and was disappointed as i could not completely read few stories the pages were blank fist bad experience of a purchase from amazon,0
wonderful i bought this tent for my NUMBER month old for christmas we were so excited when it arrived that we put it together early we bought it for NUMBER and i think we are definitely getting our money worth very durable perfect size he likes to put a chair in it and watch movies,1
too small we bought this toy to replace a tent that was falling apart that our kids loved and used in the house this one was way too small good for one kid only,0
chinese phone the keyboard and the default language is chinese after spending a long time i was able to find out how to change the language to english but still it would store names in the address book in chinese language only they should have warned the customers about this issue will try to return the phone,0
a bit much while i appreciate the daunting task of putting all that history into one volume you will find this book to be like the old adage more his story than history the writer personal value system shines through the book as he interprets his view of history one interesting rant about his major premonition about the roman empire and how it was defeated by a child in bethlehem other than a giving us a few vague moral lessons van loon gave us no insight of what jesus christ did that was so revolutionary to topple the largest superpower ever could you give us a bit of depth i do not get it,0
there are no illustrations i was very disappointed when i realized that this version does not contain the illustrations or maps i had planned on my fifth grader using this for history,0
if you are having a hard time letting go this is for you i love this guided meditation when i fall for someone i fall in love really hard and i can have a hard time moving on after a breakup even though logically i know i should and i want to this cd helps guide you through your feelings so you can release and move on every time i have used it i cry really hard which is weird to me because i would not expect to before the meditation releasing the sorrow is a big part of the healing process i highly recommend it to anyone after a recent breakup or divorce or anyone that is having a hard time letting go this will speed the healing process so you can go out and enjoy life,1
good bike rack bought this bike rack and it works perfect amazon was running it on a deal so i like that i got it for even cheaper than it was originally posted my only complaint is that if your bike is not shaped just so the bike sits a bit funny on the rack it still works but you have to secure it from a bar that fits into the plate,1
a call for rationalism in religion the patriotic writer and essayist of the american and french revolutions sets forth his beliefs on the place of religion in society he affirms the need for rationalism in religion attacks national religious institutions and points out inconsistencies and fallacies of the bible this was first published in NUMBER and it is still interesting reading today,1
dissapointed in cover and description looking at the book cover and at the now defunct editor description there was no indication this book was primarily aimed at and indeed was written for photoshop elements users the copy said it was also for photoshop users but it only covers through version NUMBER and the introduction says using applications other than elements for the actions described may not work i have not used elements so i have no idea whether the book will be helpful there it certainly not helpful for me i am a professional using photoshop cs and thought some of the tips might be worthwhile i also use paintshoppro NUMBER i thought some of this book might be worthwhile for me but i am nothing but dissapointed,0
one of the best this is probably my favorite album of all time i purchased it about NUMBER years ago and listen to it regularly can not understand a single lyric from it a few excepted but it remains one of the best i own it is soulful enchanting exciting and mysterious all at once if you are in the mood for something different that will grow on you try this one you will not regret it i promise for something similar and equally intoxicating try antonio carlos jobim wave or the composer of desafinado plays both fantastic choices,1
waste of money cheating this is not a dvd to watch it is only audio music of brad paisley with NUMBER stupid background slides they are not even real photos just digitally created a big cheat if you expect to see somehting of brad paisley,0
the best book in the series this was a awesome book that focused a lot of it attention on dairine nita annoying younger sister since i myself have an eleven year old brother who irritates me quite a lot though i will admit he not as bad as dairine i found myself truly resenting dairine character in the other books but since this book told a lot of the story from her point of view i began to dislike her less and finally in the end i realized i identified with her quite a bit this book was definitely the best in the series both in character development and in writing quality the lone power is such a cool foe kind of like the dark side of the force except it more solid than that this book would be good for anyone who likes fantasy and even those who do not might change their minds reading this books like these,1
beginning of the end of american leadership in sciences the sad reality is that year after year fewer american students are going into the fields of science and the best students and teachers are increasingly brought in from overseas most recently non citizens in the u s have received more phds in the sciences and engineering than citizens the fact that un intelligent design is given a sounding board or that idiots like phd theologians are pining on scientific theory shows how far we have fallen behind in a generation or two moronic id theories will vie hand in hand with new age idiot beliefs while leadership in real science and technology migrates to europe and asia shame,0
please guys you can not take this seriously to understand intelligent design you have to understand the political and psychological position that the united states is at intelligent design and christian science are concepts needed to create the orwellian society that the us establishment needs to propagate their position as a superpower guys open your eyes you are being lied to how come you are the only ones not seeing it,0
could be better the reader of this story was hard to follow because there was no difference in the voice of each charater i found this hard to listen to and understand sorry,0
iagogo as dull as unbuttered toast the only thing worth mentioning briefly is ewan mcgregor iago young cheerful well spoken and winning mcgregor is the most charming iago i have encountered in any medium for awhile that is very nearly enough one understands why people like and trust this man one also understands why no one takes him seriously as lieutenant material but as the play progresses and iago cruelty deepens mcgregor unvarying amiability seems incongruous a strange countertextual interpretation emerges reminiscent of auden trickster theory but with a novel twist of its own in brief iago tries to play a harmless joke on othello only to see his prank spiral out of control the poor man is forced to improvise desperately as he struggles to resolve the mess he unwittingly created iago as the boy who cried adulteress a feckless but innocent victim of events that is indeed a novel take on the play and it would be fascinating if it were not ludicrous,0
shakespeare king henry iv part NUMBER with notes wordcraft new english to old english dictionary and thesaurusif you only know shakespeare by the fact that he existed and was a play writer and you decide that you want to read one of his history plays and the history play that you pick happens to be king henry iv part one then just reading the text alone will be extremely confusing barbara hodgdon has done an amazing job editing this play and her notes are extremely helpful besides her explication of this play there are historical graphics and historical maps that will help you when reading or seeing the works of shakespeare this book is more than a college textbook it is enjoyable historical reading craig barr,1
horrible fragrance they use the same base fragrance in all of these shower hand gels and it is nasty i do not know how other reviewers give it such a high rating i had to use alchol repeatedly to remove the lingering smell from my hands after trying it nothing pleasant about this product how hard can it be to add a natural lime essence to scent a wash gel camille beckman uses some kind of artifical scents instead yuk,0
zoom in or out alvin lee zoom album is a non pretentious work but a truly well done one simple direct great from start to end is music at its best to be joyful to dance no matter if the lyrics are sad or happy it fullfills the quest of making musical sounds,0
perfect combination for adults and children even though my four year old was not ready for the entire movie she refused to leave until the credits were over because she loved the music so much i think this is a great soundtrack for both grownups and children it does allow you to visualize some of the fantastic scenes in the movie with silly songs like hot chocolate yet the soundtrack also throws in some of the beloved christmas classics for good measure all in all it is a great compilation that should please both children and adults alike,1
keurig green mountain coffee nantucket blend a very nice coffee not overly strong and with nice flavor the green mountain line of coffees are a good choice for the keurig system,1
smooth cup of coffee the nantucket blend is one of my favorite k cup coffees that i have made it a medium blend coffee that tastes great with flavored creamer or just regular creamer or milk i will definitely buy more of this one,1
fit my fuel pump canister exactly the original bosch fuel pump died in my NUMBER saturn after NUMBER years of service a replacement part was NUMBER for a NUMBER year old car no thank you i replaced it with a walbro pump bought on amazon let us be honest dropping the tank and replacing the pump is not a fun thing to do and you do not want to do it again any time soon in installing the new pump in the old housing it makes no sense not to replace the strainer as well the old one in my car was yellow somewhat brittle after doing its job for NUMBER years some fuel pump makers will not warrant the replacement pump unless you replace this part as well i can understand that as it is not hard to imagine pieces of a disintegrating strainer being sucked up and constricting the pump mechanism hey if you are going to spend money on a pump and the time to pull it spend the few extra bucks to do it right so that you do not have to do it again soon,1
woderful and memorable i watched this series when i was ten years old i was astounded by the cinematography it might have not been as advanced as today movies but it was worth the shot you certainly will need patience to watch the movie but if you are a lover of the series you can let your mind roam free during turbulent times in my life in nigeria it provided me with a way of escape i loved the theme song and i loved aslan he was stern with the girl because she needed to know the gravity of her situation,1
very very weak it amazing how weak this album is the drum programming is tedious and sounds banal as do the riffs and the production this is a truly terrible album probably the worst most uninspiring thing i have ever had the mispleasure of hearing i was so put off by this album i never gave them a second chance so i do not know if their other albums are any good i do know that rosetta stone adrenaline and the sisters of mercy first and last and always are infinitely better examples of this programmed drum gothic rock type schtick,0
legendary i do not care how much elgar you have this should be in your library the composer rendition of his second is one of the best it should be considered a standard you might also be taken with the ancient version of the cello concerto the sad rugged atmosphere is captured,1
the worse movie since the english patient i just got to tell you that i was just bored to tears watching this long and stupid movie this one does not earn the rights for an academy award,0
very good who said that this movie was based on historycal facts so what all the bs from the over reviewers about a gladitor woould never do this or that an emperor blablablablabla if you want history go to the library and get a book if you want great action great settings beautiful pictures and exceptional acting then get this movie crowe phoenix are great the story is full of action suspense love etc great movie,1
roma ben hur spartacus even the ever tantilizing roma no other film of the roman epic class will ever compare to the beauty and splendor that is found in gladiator russell crowe is one of the few leading men who truely fits the strong silent role perfectly while horribly tradgic the movie astounds me every time i watch it you will need to nuke NUMBER or NUMBER bags of popcorn prior to the movie you will be too captivated to get up for food let alone to pause the film,1
avoid this bd release of gladiator the picture is extremely shoddy in this blu ray release avoid like the plague so the studio gets the idea what the heck is the studio doing releasing this atrocious transfer on bd when the movie itself is such a great one unbelievable a movie like this should have a flawless transfer argh,0
gladiator this is by far my favorite movie russell crowe acting is superb all parts of this movie are fasinating and entertaining i would recomend this movie to anyone if you have not seen it yet you are missing out this film has everything important to a good plot and screenplay drama drama drama,1
upscaled dvd is better i do not have to say it since everyone knows but just wanted to add my thoughts to this release paramount needs to give those of us who purchased this a free trade in for the re release that supposedly coming out that fixes this quality control problem on cable and satellite the broadcast version is actually the way it supposed to look it true NUMBER p as opposed to this upscaled dvd looking mess i am sorry for all of us and very disappointed get with the program paramount,0
the best movie i have ever seen the best movie i have even seen great directing and acting has everything you want action love romance it has it all,1
great movie bad blu ray i love this movie more than love itself it is one of the most amazing movies ever made period but the quality of this blu ray is garbage wait until the re release or just get the dvd to bad it looks so awful great movie,0
an epic like no other i worked for the most well known entertainment company in the world so i am very familiar with the formula used in epics such as gladiator yet even with the knowledge of how it would follow the peaks and valleys of a pre determined storyline it was still an amazing movie i watched it NUMBER times in the first week of its release in the theaters and i bought several copies of the dvd for family and friends watch this movie uninterrupted without distraction and on the biggest screen you can access among the best movies of all time,1
blu ray at best quality or bust seriously either make the blu ray copy the best transfer available or do not bother we already have the dvd version so it not a rush to meet a street date this movie has been around for a while now the only reason fans are rushing out to buy it on blu ray is because they love the film and they want the best quality version of it duh to release a lame transfer of this film is inexcusable i returned my copy on principle alone and will wait for the the correct release anyone remember fifth element,0
awesome movie almost amazing picture awesome movie story acting etc the blu ray quality was good but not blown away NUMBER stars great i too could see the arrows in the beginning plus different markings on the packaging so i am assured it is the remastered version,1
stunning brilliant classic masterpiece etc why is everyone complaining that this movie is not historically accurate who cares it a movie not an encyclopedia strong performances by evereyone particularly by crowe and phoenix even though its NUMBER minutes long it keeps you interested with amazing battle scenes and well written plot everytime i watch it only one word comes to mind stunning this is one of the all time greats,1
barely palatable i believe this is one of the top NUMBER over hyped films in recent years enough hype to garnish a best picture from the self lauding acedamy in all of the two hours of so called honor courage and loyalty all i seem to get is bad acting a contrived story and fast moving scenes it reminds me of eating a large vat of buttered popcorn a big box of jujubees washed down with a NUMBER oz soda fills you up but no nutrition,0
potential unrealized knowing that the movie would be basically historically inaccurate i went expecting to like it anyway however despite some excellent performances the movie is too long and does not really realize it potential my biggest complaint was the very obvious transitions between live action and computer animation something that should not occur with the techniques available today russell crowe performance is the saving grace of the movie but i can not recommend it to anyone interested in historical fact or riveting drama,0
rubbish this comes from an action fan and this aint no action film i was expecting something to keep me excited and on the edge of my seat no way there are like NUMBER fighting scences and admitedlly these are very good but that does not lift the whole film the dialogue in between these fight scences is laughable i went to sleep NUMBER times in the cinema now some people might like borin chat but i do not if a film is goin be based on the talking it should at least be well written like shawshank redemtion but this is borin i repeat borin borin borin i know a lot of people will disagree with this but then maybe they werent expecting an action fest like it billed so if u like boring chatter a lot of and a fighting not much of then buy this but i personally would not buy it the end of my rant,0
poor recording have not been able to watch it as the picture and noise not movie noise is so bad sorry,0
this blu ray will not work on australian region b players hello everyone just to bring it to the attention of all region b player owners the version of this movie that amazon is selling will not play on region b blu ray players i did do my research on www bluray com there is information there that says it is region free but this information is wrong at least for this version of the movie anyway i like this movie by the way it was my first purchase on dvd i hope this saves some people from making the same mistake i did amazon are not to blame they resolved my issue in less then NUMBER day i love shopping for blu rays here and this will not discourage me from any future purchases just make sure you do your research before you buy all the best,0
wait for it to be done right i watched and compared the blu ray to my dts dvd do not support this kind of crap transfers i will wait for this to be done right i gave it two stars only for the audio the video is really annoying,0
maximus it is a great tale perhaps historical i ll have to go o computer to decipher it maximus the great more words is tooo much folderal NUMBER,1
NUMBER best picture and NUMBER other oscars simply the best picture of NUMBER and perhaps for years this is an instant classic russell crowe sits with the greats like kirk douglas and charlton heston get this dvd even better get ben hur and spartacus and have a roman marathon,1
just buy the dvd do not believe all the five star reviews this release has received many of those are for the film itself and were entered in before the blu ray was even released as others have said the picture on this blu ray is pathetic dnr and ee everywhere i am no a v fanatic but even i can tell when a blu ray looks like crap especially this one if you love the movie just buy the dvd version and watch it up scaled on your blu ray player it will save you some serious money and frustration,0
classic gladitor is a must have in any movie collection it is one of the few movies that is comparable to the likes of braveheart,1
quite sub par i can not seem to get over the fact that russel crowe won an oscar for this he swung a sword around for NUMBER hours come on if you want to see the best actor of NUMBER i will refer you to javier bardem before night falls crowe character reached no emotional level whatsoever we saw his wife kid through NUMBER seconds of silent flashbacks tell me why we should sympathize with his grieving well photographed well choreographed but the rest craptacular,0
worth it just for the NUMBER minute montage of missing scenes well worth the money there are NUMBER minutes of deleted scenes but the best part is the NUMBER minutes set to music of unused footage you will see why i do not want to spoil it for you,1
disappointing having heard so many wonderful things about this film i expected a lot i was quite disappointed great cast but not great acting i was bored through most of it and not even russell crowe was worth watching he is most brilliant in romper stomper gladiator certainly does not measure up to the great spartacus,0
artificial contrived etc this movie was better when it was called ben hur and i hated ben hur the effects here were so overdone the computer generated scenery so artificial i felt ill computer imagery ought to be used only when necessary and with a budget like this clunkers real scenery would have been easy the acting was fair i will admit but the script so trite and forced one wonders why the actors even bother oh yeah money this movie is all hype bleckt,0
wat another edition it really stinks first it was single disc then there was a NUMBER disc release and now an extended NUMBER disc edition is up for pre order can someone at dreamworks clarify how many more editions will we have publishing houses like dreamworks are too busy cashing in on great movies like gladiator and are just not bothered about the hard earned money people spend on buying earlier versions of the movie,0
disappointing this movie could have been great russell crowe is despite the not so well written screenplay and mediocre plot very convincing in his role in fact he is the only one who makes a pretty good job in this movie phoenix was not bad but that just because russell crowe in an excellent actor the movie fails because it was bad told and not well directed you could not identify nor share the characters feelings because of the large distance there seemed to be between them and the audience and that where the director fails in the telling of the story,0
zero stars do not buy amazon selling you broken inferior product i will not rehash all the explanations on the problems with the gladiator blu ray please read the other reviews for a technical explanation suffice it to say there is a new version that has been cleaned up and looks gorgeous and there is an old version that is junk the old version was so bad that the studio recognized it and decided it needed to be corrected but guess what amazon insists on clearing out their old stock and selling you the junk version i ordered this last week and figured there is no way they would be doing this but guess what i was wrong here a giveaway on the cover of the case there is a mail in rebate that expired in june NUMBER absolutely pathetic showing by amazon,0
a good action flick not the deepest movie of all time but i am a sucker for movies about men of honor perservering against the liers and cheaters of the world in my opinion rob roy is another better version of this story the action sequences are top notch and russell crowe portrays the quiet strength of a weary veteran quite well the plot bogs down towards the end and the final few scenes were a bit too melodramatic for my taste but that ok,1
poor video transfer this is an absolutely terrible transfer it is ridden with edge enhancement halos on contrasting edges and severe noise reduction smoothing the image to reduce film grain and detail this is so severe that film elements such as arrows and spears in the battle at the beginning are not visible it barely an upgrade over dvd and simply not what a movie of this caliber deserves it is extremely unfortunate that such an outstanding movie has been treated so poorly stick with the dvd and do not buy this blu ray disc,0
warning will robinson a disaster of over the top dnr ee what were they thinking as mentioned by other reviewers the video transfer of the blu ray edition of gladiator has been reduced to vhs quality and suggest anyone hire views before buying but recommend all stay well clear as this is a lemon if you absolutely must have it regardless of quality do so at your own risk i am sticking with my dvd edition for now for more detail on specifics of all the issues see the discussion on the avs forum the review at the digital bits looks like we will all have to wait a couple of years until the studio concerned with this release paramount universal do a new edition and remaster the original without all the excessive dnr ee and such compared to initial reports of braveheart this blu ray release is clearly a disaster,0

good movie but best picture of the year this was a good action flick and all the fights and battles are great russel crowe does a great job and deserves praise but the movie does not flow logically the reasons crowe was made a slave are not clear he crying at the death of his family and a foot appears next he a slave this coming from the man who has fought his way out of so many battles including death in germany when the current ruler was overthrown there are several moments where i was not sure why things were happening that okay for an action flick but i expect more from the academy are we ready to throw plot development out the window when the action is good man i hope not by the way the recreation of rome was awesome another plus for the movie so why did i give it only two stars well to be honest in protest over the academy nomination not that the field was all that great this year,0
rip off why not issue the extended edition NUMBER minutes in a set with the theatrical release a rip off as is so common,0
a braveheart want to be shame on you scottmus i have been of the opinion that ridley scott is an opportunist with no originality while braveheart itself fabricates history it is not without some enthusiastic immitators ridley scott evidently took the braveheart forumla to heart and his attempt to clone it is the flick gladiator i realize it a matter of personal taste but the choice of crowe as the leading character is a poor one there always something filthy and unseemly that comes through crowe i can not put my finger on it but it a persistent problem with crowe as far as i am concerned now back to scott his latest venture kingdom of heaven again follows the braveheart formula and exploits the hatred towards islam in the west an opportunist he is,0
gladiator stretches the bounds of believability the worst of all is the notion that a man who can go single handed against NUMBER or so other gladiators and slice them all down or to pieces one after the other in a small arena on the outskirts of the empire would so calmly allow himself to be re shackled at the end of each performance by a minimum security force belonging to a merchant slave trader high plains drifter was a much more realistic scenario,1
NUMBER star movie NUMBER star dvd i love this movie it powerful action packed and well it just rocks great directing by ridley scott legend bladerunner g i jane thelma louise alien great acting by russel crowe joaquin phoenix and richard harris great costumes awsome score by hans zimmer i have the cd this movie has everything action revenge gore romance great cgi well worth buying you might have heard some discouraging remarks such as gladiator not being historically acurate but it is not supposed to be it fiction its based on history yes but so is braveheart which is pretty unacurate and you do not see people chasing down randal wallace with torches braveheart is a great movie too though now not only is the movie great but the two disk dvd is awsome over NUMBER deleted scenes NUMBER long featurettes feature length commentary great interactive menus and a great addition to anyones dvd collection,1
absolutely flawless a magnificent and wholly believable performance by russel crowe you d almost want to pick up a gladius and follow him yourself,1
shockingly bad i must have seen some kind of director cut of gladiator that the only way that i can explain the fact that everyone seems to like or at least to tolerate this complete waste of film stock i have rarely seen a movie with a real budget that was more poorly written every line made me wince and the historical inaccuracies are so widespread that it really not possible to talk in any meaningful sense about this movie being a tale of ancient rome you will probably like it though everyone else seems to,0
ugh i finally gave up this book was so awful i could not make it past page NUMBER the plot was boring the sentences drag on and on endlessly i kept waiting for something that made sense i did not find anything and finally threw the book down and gave up i will not read anymore of this book or the series,0
another reader looking for another adventure when i first got this book from the library i put it down after NUMBER pages at the time it had looked to me like a big boring book i brought it home again to give it another chance like NUMBER years later and i think it great the story is good bringing magic into a world you are most familiar w and even entering more worlds the story of NUMBER year old girl mixed with another boy is weaved together of them trying to learn magic just novices they are experimenting w speech that leads them to a lot of trouble i think duane had a great idea and even if it not as exciting as some other books it worth it,1
just as good as harry so you want to be a wizard is about a NUMBER year old girl named nida and a NUMBER year old boy named christapher a k a kit who are learning how to be wizards this book is just as good as the harry potter books,1
i loved this book i read this during vacation so i had a lot of time i would ussually take a while to read for me a ten year old as i began i could not put it down i read of the adventures of kit and nita as they found by accident fred the white hole and tryed to get out of a land where there were no humans only cars and machines with minds humans can not survive in this land to find out what happened in this great book read it obviously,1
diane duane is brilliant i waited for months to find this book having read deep wizardry and high wizardry first and it was worth the wait this is a fantastic book with an excellent plot it is a bit complicated and i recommend reading it at least twice to fully understand it people complain that it no harry potter and they are right this is not harry potter it something more than harry could be not better but more diane duane has a fantastic talent in describing things she really shows you everything i highly recommend this it one of the best books i have ever read and that saying something if you do not like it it probably just because such deep sci fi is not your cup of tea and that great,1
sad to say i did not like this book i really wanted to but i just do not i bought this book thinking it was similar to the harry potter series in nature and spirit but i was very wrong the characters are acceptable but the author did a poor job of developing the kit character also the writing is exceedingly dull the story slogs along at an incredibly slow pace truthfully i found the story boring but i read it anyway i will not be reading the rest of the series i think the writer biggest mistake is trying to write the magic as if it were scientifically possible and she spent way too much time trying to do so newsflash its magic you know fantasy you do not need to make it or prove it fantasy is simply a world that does not need explaining or proving i think someone very young might like this book but i did not i am moving on to another series that has better writing,0
bla i thought that this book was just kind of boring the part with the white dwarf star that was hicoughing up all sorts of things was the only funny part and the rest was just wierd and dumb contrary to one of the other reveiwers the book was so much worse than harry potter,0
not so good this book has a good title it sounded great when i got it the only thing is most of the plot is about how they got sucked into another world it starts ok but then cars are trying to kill them do cars randomly runing around trying to kill people sound like an important plot i can not beleave she made a sequel,0
it no harry potter if you are looking for something to hold you over until the next book in the harry potter series do not look here as a writer of fantasy diane duane makes an excellent science fiction author if you consider sentient marble sized galaxies ferocious living helicopters and predatory automobiles the staple for a book about magic and wizardry then by all means get yourself a copy otherwise check out some of the more traditional fare like the magician nephew or the other books in the chronicles of narnia series by c s lewis or two shining stars by madeleine a wrinkle in time and many waters,0
and there goes my birthday money i love this book it is a great a little like harry potter only has more of an adult plot a k a more complicated i feel in love with this book and immediatly bought deep wizardry high wizardry and a wizard abroad all contiuations of the series which gets better as you go and if you love cats check out book of night with moon which fetures wizarding cats and all your favorite characters from the other books,1
accurate readings this product appears to be accurate and was fairly easy to install i would like larger print on the screen as it is hard to read at a glance the numbers are large enough but the lettering is small,1
deep wizardry this book was so boring it could have been a lot more effective if it was shorter and more to the point,0
romance and laughs abound i read this book in one day and enjoyed every minute of it it has the classic beauty and the beast theme which happens to be a favorite of mine samantha was a spunky heroine who quick wit and spunk made her the perfect match for her impatient patient gabriel was a hero to be adored unlike most wounded heroes who choose to sulk and mope about gabriel defense was witty sarcasm and a beastly temper he was a complete ass and i simply adored him i found myself laughing out loud several times throughout the book and even came close to shedding a tear or two highly recommended,1
sweet romance this was my first read my teresa medeiros and it will not be my last i enjoyed the character development gabriel was a great tortured hero this one had a plot twist that totally surprised me,1
dear old nolan philip nolan a man who is sentenced to remain at sea for his entirelife with the punishment to never hear nor see of the united states again hale captures patriotism and heroic efforts in one man as nolan bravely tries to hide the fact he still loves his country but shall never see it again it makes you proud to be an american and live under the glory that our forefathers fought for so many times have i read this story and each time i can barely get past parts that bring a tear to my eye ultimately a great and powerful book for any reader who enjoys a story of love agony and pride,1
bragg books are the best the braggs have so much solid time proven info for optimal health each one is jam packed with valuable self care info which in my opinion is the best and only way to go between this and my naturopath i am in great shape no unnecessary drugs and surgeries for me,1
an excellent film noir full of suprises the proposal is an intelligent first rate undercover police story with a lot of twists and turns that you can never see coming the director has a real knack for building tension and suspense it keeps increasing as the story progresses and the mystery deepens as it unfolds jennifer esposito really proves that she can play the leading role in a feature she radiant and nick moran from lock stock and two smoking barrels plays the nervous paranoid undercover cop to perfection stephen lang tombstone is awesome as the subtly psychotic crime lord and it nice to see william b davis x files smoking man play an fbi agent who does not smoke very clever unpredictable good looking film noir highly recommended,1

one of the worst films i have ever seen i can not believe that there are actually reviewers who actually liked this film this film was a mammoth failure on all levels the script was terrible there was really no story whatsoever and it just did not make sense sean penn to me is the greatest actor of our generation but this was his worst performance sean southern accent was so bad that i had to actually turn on the english subtitles to understand him this movie just did not make sense and was full of holes that were never filled or explained by the movies end and i clapped when the film finally ended the only good performances were by james gandolfini who was very convincing made me totally forget tony soprano and patricia clarkson ws good do not waste two hours of your life watching this garbage go buy the original version which is a classic and far superior,0
bowie meets mozart o k so i know these quartet tributes are not everybody idea of a great tribute but i love these things i have several and this one stands up with the better ones obviously it makes little or no sense to have cd dedicated to some of these artists i mean matchbox NUMBER oh well the bowie stands up with the tommy and the floyd discs as something i could see myself going out to see i have always taken some of this music very seriously and it feels good to hear it presented in this format not for everybody but then what really is,1

joe pickett must be the author himself as reviewer joe pickett said this book is well written and enjoyable my personal preference is for single state travel books because they are more exhaustive in their coverage and thus more useful when traveling the reason for this review is my amusement at finding an earlier review of this book from NUMBER written by joe pickett joe pickett is the name of the fictional hero of author c j box excellent mystery series set in wyoming and these books started appearing in NUMBER after this review with the award winning open season i love these books a perfect blend of mystery and western so what say you mr box did you write the NUMBER review for this book i also can not help but wonder if c j box is your real name perhaps you are a relative of edgar box gore vidal famous pseudonym,1

we will always have parrots i agree with pork chop t boring no character development and a weird repetition of what would hopefully been a plot i added a collection on my kindle called rejects,0
not as good as previous i loved the first book in this series but this book lacked that same warmth it is just chock full of totally bizarre characters and not enough of the good characters i really tried to finish this book but i just could not care enough about what happens to anyone in it,0
why the original was a sexy and track performed by a half decent r b group rl and next could really hit it off any make people want to dance it was a good track in NUMBER and i think would be next biggest track and theres this a fake ass attempt from some pretty british boys to become an r b group blues version of this song is nothing but an attempt by the record company to cash in on others material and success they do not add anything to the song making it sound almost identical to the original even the backing track sounds almost the same as the original i completely dislike this version of the song and i passionately dislike this group and everything they come out with and yes iam very biased in my opinion here blue stick to what you good at singing at the pub or at the kareoke bars,0
the plague of life the plague is an example of great existentialist writing at time the novel is slow moving with very little development but it is overall pretty decent,1
a stunning acheivement of existential genius this masterful work portrays with elegant simplicity the existential condition of man suitable for readers who have never read an existential camus novel or for experts in metaphysics this book is a must for any person who has ever wondered about the condition of man camus derserved his nobel prize just for this book alone this novel is the apex of camus writings in this readers opinion and provides clear insights to every reader buy this book,1
not an introductory text as an accompaniment to the program maclogic for an upper level course i can see where this book would have a place unfortunately my introduction to it was tutoring for an introductory class the material is well written and organized but far too densely written particularly for students who have never had a logic class before and are coming from questionable mathematics backgrounds that there is no index of symbols just makes navigating the text that much more difficult on another level the author seems to eschew a good many things that many other logic courses at least those i have seen and taken use in depth things like modus ponens are barely touched on in favor of v e disjunction elimination this seems unusual for an introductory textbook in the field though i am not familiar enough to know for certain,0
not worth the money i purchased this product because i was interested in a cooling fan setup for my NUMBER the sole reason i purchased this particular cooling stand was because of the green led lights on the base of the stand i just received the unit today and the lights which i will reiterate are the only reason i bought this particular stand do not work there was no mention of the lights not working in the description despite it being a used unit it seems to me the seller left this out very unhappy with the fact that they seem to be broken product is otherwise cheap and paying double for something that seems to work better might be a better idea worst case scenario you could probably set up your own led lighting and it probably look better i would not recommend this to anyone,0
boring tedious predictable i was extremely unhappy with this film speed searching did not even help do not waste your time,0
watch it brilliant brilliant one of if not the best movie ever made by one of if not the best director who ever lived the photography is amazing and includes tecniques that were never before seen on the big screen such as filming from the hero subject point of view the sharp cuts and strong colors that are used empathize the intensity of the film and kubrick is constently mocking the viewers by playing with their feeling concerning the main character alex who is at first the vilain and at the end the innocent helpless victim used and abused by society the cinical message that the movie tries to pass on is cristal clear and relevant to the time when it was published it is also a message very much empathized by the book which is by the way terrible and written with the skill of my three year old brother kubrick generally critisizes the development of a cold rottong society that will not possibly survive for long in conclusion the movie it the work of a true genius,1
shocking upsetting powerful let me blunt i direct hard core full on bondage and s m porn for a living there is very little that can upset me or get inside my skin and bother me for days and weeks afterwards but this movie did it i almost had to turn away while watching and i did have nightmares i would also find myself staring off into the distance reliving the most disturbing parts in my mind this is without a doubt a masterpiece i doubt i will ever watch it again but a movie than create such emotion within the viewer deserves a good honest review,1
terrible movie i watched it and thought of it as just bad i am speechless it just bad please do not watch this movie,0
sick sick sick i do not know what you people see in this movie but it just made me ill i can not simpathise this ultraviolent man who has been fixed so that he can not defend himself against the revenge he most certainly deserves with terrible production design with naked woman dining tables and that psychadelic apartment hardly any of this movie actually looks like the future though some may argue that that is not important to the story i dissagree at least NUMBER looked like the future and i just do not see the need for all of that nudity and that penis shaped sculpture kubrick is no genius he sick,0
viddy well with all of the mediocre crap such as titanic and ever after polluting the theaters and sending audiences into a frenzy it good to watch this classic and discover what actual monumental film making is all about god bless kubrick for creating this ultraviolent masterpiece,1
this is quite possibly the greatest movie of all time i have seen this movie at least NUMBER times and it just gets better everytime kubrick does an excellent job of adapting burgess book to the big screen excellent directing and acting make this a must see it is a bit harsh but if viewed as a whole the movie makes a strong point about how far we can go when trying to rehabilitate the criminal mind i also recommend reading the book after watching the movie it has more detail and a different ending,1
there was me great movie stanley kubrick is personaly my favorite director after watching this movie after i read the book i went out and bought the movie without seeing it i think that the movie is as good as the book the only downside to the whole movie is it did not add the additional chapter like in the book but even the ending to the movie is great kubrick really scored big in this movie back then to make a movie as hard core as this one was crazy but he did it this movie is so ahead of it time but it my favorite movie of all time,1
made a big impact it quite a while since i saw this movie but it made a big impact on me at the time i particularly liked kubrick use of classical music i am keen to purchase a vhs copy but it would have to be in the pal format suitable for australia,1
simply a masterpiece on so many different levels does this movie based on the novel by anthony burgess excell many will take one look at this film and abruptly deem it disgusting or sadistic but look closer and you will find an incredible performance on multiple levels from the cinematography which makes you feel a as if you are a part of alex the lead character and the soundtrack which at first boggles your mind with the pieces selected until your realize that there are none more fitting to accompany the story to the obvious ideals and statements on society which burgess realized and kubric conveyed in my mind one of if not the greatest books of all time transformed into one of if not the greatest movies of all time an all around masterpiece a movie for which NUMBER stars simply does not do it justice,1
the best in ultra violence if you have never seen this movie please do you will not regret it even though it was made in NUMBER it has not lost any of the horror humor ultra violence or message there is nothing dated about this movie i wonder if kubrick planned it that way i far surpasses any movie on this particular subject that has been made since really malcom mcdonald should have won an academy award for his performance he was perfectly cast,1
a very uneven movie even though there were occasional brilliances i kept asking myself why so many people found this movie great i found the story very incoherent and everything was excessive it was full of overacting and overdirecting there are some stories to which movies just can not do justice i rather read the book than watch this movie version i think people should stop justifying this film only because kubrik made it,0
it colombian not columbian how do you expect to get to someone liking if you do not even know how to spell their name it is colombian not columbian unless it is from columbia ny,0
love that can not be stopped susanna baird enjoyed traveling with her writer grandfather robert debenham but their trip to malta was an exception first her grandfather fakes illness to stay free at the house of the marquis ramiro st vincent susanna labeled him a ogre then she found he had a son minu lorenzo who was crippled by a badly crushed foot susanna found her label for his father was not bad enough when she discovered minu could have the foot fixed but his father did not want his child seeing people outside his home the child had no friends except two dogs and a monk susanna soon befriends the child and his lonely heart is captured by her sweet nature soon susanna finds she is falling in love with the ogre and he tells her he wants nothing to do with it her love later ramiro tells susanna that he is going to marry another woman a woman he does not love who does not love him minu over hears this and runs away ramiro comes to his senses at last and they all live happily ever after,1
passionate and moving i am very impressed with this film i am a catholic and generally happy with that fact but i am not stupid and the catholic church certainly has done terrible wrong back then and even now i had heard of martin luther and was curious to know more about him what this film gives in incredible i have never heard even the pope talk like this the pure unbridled faith of luther is moving the best part of this film is that it is not trying to preach it does not say believe this instead it presents the story without apologies and lets you decide what you think of luther views the church is portrayed as concerned for christianity as a whole but more importantly overwhelmed with the furtherance of it own power and crushing influence i believe this is true even to this day the world would be a better place if more people like luther were in it this will go in best of the best in my collection,1
worth watching the movie was well done and dramatic the acting was good although one could tell it was sectarian my one main criticism is that the story did not portray the decisive factor in luther conversion justification by faith alone sufficiently this was the lynchpin and pivotal doctrine that separated luther from the catholic church and the papacy,1
great movie very enjoyable movie that is rather accurate historically on the big points it showed luther as a man tormented by his demons as he tried to stay faithful to the word of god,1
luther movie vhs as the teacher of a women bible class in a lutheran church i showed this movieluther vhs after the class had completed six weeks of study on dr martin luther life and influence on the protestant reformation i would highly recommend this product because it stays true to historical facts and is not padded for today audiences,0
good movie this is a good movie and a decent portrayal of luther the plot is well done for the volumes of information covered the acting is adequate and the costumes are outstanding some of the actors personal beliefs portions of the historical representations and the film is definitely from the perspective of the lutheran church while relatively ballanced one must still keep the presuppositions of those who created it in mind when viewing the historical material the producers could have expounded on some additional elements in the time period that were directly related that might have helped a bit more in keeping the bias level less apparent but the film definitely falls way short of being the propoganda some critics have labeled it while not your saturday night date flic it is most assuredly a well done film and worth watching,1
very accurate this is a very accurate presentation of luther and the events that happened i have read a couple of church history books and this movie is almost verbatem,1
teacher i am teaching some young preachers from out of my church and personally used this book when in bible college over NUMBER years ago it is a great book very detailed with information that will help any young or older preacher know more about his ministry and how to perform it,1

the system how to get ripped off today the entire contents of this book could fit on one page of paper the remainder of the book is filled with art and babble there even recipes in the back not kidding do not buy this book unless you want to learn first hand how to get ripped off today,0
buddha lounge as bland as white bread it is a misrepresentation to link this series of NUMBER cds in any way to the buddha bar cds or the chillout music category in general it could play in the background without anyone ever raising their head or moving their body if your thing is new age music this might be for you everyone else is forewarned,0
total waste of money it is way too hard to get this stuff off after use if you happen to touch anything but your body it is on there for good the bottle itself develops a super greasy feel immediately after the first use go with the id glide water based lube instead millennium costs twice as much is a total mess and does not feel nearly as good my gf hates this stuff too so it was a total loss,0
returned could not get enough channels even with purchase of an external antenna to make it worth the price,0
without their kabuki face makeup kiss would be nowhere kiss is a lame band with their image only covering for their many songs with inane lyrics with their makeup and concerts they write a song if their lives depended on it if you want metal buy a metallica cd if you want moronic disgiuses and cd titles like psycho circus buy kiss by the way only the dumbest band in the world would try to get cash by getting tood macfarlane to create a series of comic books and action figures,0
wow if everyone actually listens to the words in all the songs they will see that each has a special meaning that deals with real life not exactly like the kiss of NUMBER years ago but things do change cd song quality is excellent thumbs up guys,0
soft and predictable the attempt to make another destroyer fell very short the title track is easily the best song on this album it was obvious right away that peter criss was not playing on it he have that kind of talent so why go in and make this album at all before it even came out you knew that peter would be singing a ballad i finally found my way is no beth or hard luck woman the rest of it is just too soft there is no heavy drum sound it almost like a weak lick it up minus the better songs get back with eric and bruce do not worry about makinganother destroyer i will be satisfied with another revenge,0
classic kiss nope disappointing i have not listened to this album since i bought it yes i like kiss but this album just does not do anything for me they should have recorded another destroyer rock and roll over etc but this is not the case here save your money,0
i give it a solid NUMBER stars i think this is a solid kiss album about NUMBER of the songs stand out as some of my favorites i just listened to it after about NUMBER years the only thing i hate is the sound quality the highs are tinny and the bass is so flat but i guess thats cds for ya i wish this came out on vinyl,1
pandering to new fans i made the mistake of buying this album having not heard any of the songs and only being a faithful fan of kiss yeah i think that new fans people that started to listen to kiss after the reunion might enjoy this it has all of the elements of classic kiss but it missing something do i think that the prime motivation for this was the money yes purely for cash it nice that the fans had something to go with the tour that was happening at the time but this album does not age very well mainly because this album was not very good in it conception and was executed poorly in retrospect kiss has made worse albums unmasked comes to mind peter criss solo album was weak but at least an effort was made animalize was poor but kiss was playing catch up and was breaking in a new guitarist too some of the tunes are catchy enough but that wears off quickly based on the merit of the somewhat catchy songs i rated this NUMBER stars other than that not much here,0
what a joke i was a huge kiss fan was being the operative word this album is bad in so many ways within is the only song worth listening to and you will probably enjoy it more if you pretend it someone other than kiss we have heard the truth about kiss over the last few years they lie to their fans and take every last cent they can get out of them the fact that there was no one else doing what they did in the NUMBER s makes them unique but not great after all every snowflake is unique but it still just a snowflake,0
tengo un alma caribe a even if you have never been to caribbean gloria takes you there with this cd perhaps the majority of the songs are on the slower side but she is soulful and it shows my friend bought this cd and i borrowed it so much that i got it for myself the no me dejes remix will get you dancing tres gotas de agua bendita is really fun and lively with celia cruz while por un beso is a heartbreaker yet even in the slower songs the background music stays true to the caribbean which i appreciated dale you will not regret the purchase,1
hummm not too much i found this album a little dissapointing and the sensation increase in comparation with mi tierra the main thing on this is the track selection wich makes the whole a very downtempo album althought there a couple of up high beat pieces the sensation i percive it like if there were a down for gloria and she wanted to put it in the album that no bad the bad thing comes up when i heard it and i can not get down just a little bored there no feeling no emotion no heart no music if you are planning to buy a gloria cd do not get this one mi tierra would do it best,0

the number is zero what a waste of paper and time there is much talk of how eisenberg has hit the sweet spot with this book bah humbug sweet nothings is more like it entertainingly and personably written it as informative as a jerry seinfeld tv skit about finances eisenberg writes extremely well but it all much ado about nothing read the last two short chapters at the bookstore and put the money you save into your NUMBER k,0
every worker should read this book this is a great book for anyone NUMBER who is working and thinking they have it made as a recent early retiree baby boomer everything in this book rang true it not about the number it about how you spend it and how you need to be prudent in your working years in addition the book reads like a novel i could not put it down eisenberg writing is phenomenal b slomka,1
an important read for anyone concerned about retiring this book is well worth the time to read the tone is light but the message is very serious it is an excellent book but to my tastes it could have been edited into a shorter volume,1
pointless and depressing i thought that i was doing ok financically until i read this book there is little or no financial insight or direction to this book i really never got the point it makes you feel that unless you are worth a minimum of NUMBER million dollars you might as well check into the poorhouse i kept reading hoping to get the point and it was never there,0
killer of ssx every other ssx game was amazing this one was very disappointing i was at a store and i was thrilled to see it on the shelf i spent wasted NUMBER dollars on this and started playing the second i got home the music was horrible the graphics were good i hated the gameplay this is baisically the game there the tour and your trying to get in NUMBER st place you get a better rank every time you beat a challenge another thing i do not like about this game is that you make a guy but you can not be any of the classic characters well you can unlock them but thats only for NUMBER player and whenn you race against them in NUMBER player they are completely different like for example you have to race against nate from ssx NUMBER and instead of being like a normal guy he is like a hick or something and the point is that if you like the ssx seiries do not get this game,0

more on marilyn the song continues is an updated version of horne earlier my life much of the text is the same even so we needed an update did not we for having a kind of take no prisoners style horne is pretty generous with foes as well as friends she does not re tell the sills scala incident here there are some new pictures which is wonderful even more wonderful and almost worth the purchase price all on its own is the bonus cd there are NUMBER songs on the cd while they do not come up in chronological order they are generally arranged earlier to later you can still get the feeling for how that miraculous instrument evolved i am glad i have both books,1
love his other books but it pains me to write anything negative about david mead work as i highly value and wholeheartedly recommend his other books in particular the ten minute guitar workout basic guitar workout and rhythm a step by step guide to understanding rhythm for guitar these are all great learning tools that would serve guitarists of almost any level well but then there this book it not bad but it not nearly as concise as his other works in fact i read it three times and still felt rather confused maybe i am an idiot but when it comes to explaining the caged system of organizing the fretboard which is ultimately what this book is about i learned more in NUMBER pages of bill edward excellent fretboard logic series than in reading this book from cover to cover buy mead other books especially if you are an intermediate or beginner but if you want to master the fretboard get fretboard logic there is no other,0

hieroglyphic maps the joy of origamithis book is colorful and seemed promising for a beginner to self teach the diagrams maybe okay if you already know what they are suppose to look like at each step but as a teaching aid they compare to teaching american children from a hieroglyphic test i bought another book on the same subject to help get through the simplest basics but it was only marginally better van sicklen is not a beginner writer this book could easily drive people away from the art through frustration,0
part NUMBER i believe that this book is preety cheap when i bought it i was so enthusiastic to learn math exept for the procrastinations intervening with the main plot which i consider a very constant consistent and reliable flow of information explaining very deltailed which formula you need to apply in which situation despite the statements which i have claimed about the quality of the book cheap i still believe it passes my test by a mile and it explanations are extraordinary namely for beginners you can not even start to anticipate how this book altered my math grade instead of arbitrarily electing some sequence for the formulae he invents his own effective process i recommend this book to all the folks who have a b a so that they can progress and have an a for the jungens with c they would presumably not understand the context,1
joe oh no as a joe jackson fan this comes off as a major dissapointment joe pulls off a fairly uninspired striped down live album recorded at nyc joes pub while it nice to hear some of the old standards again like one more time and hometown he also does duke ellington mood indigo which sounds out of place and sung painfully his version of steely dan king of the world sounds strained he should have put in any major dude which he did so much better at the bottom line a few months before this gig his musicianship is still very good but you are left asking what the point of this record we can only hope that we get more of his quality stuff in night day ii due this fall,0
good it was a bit more pinkish red than i had thought the lava and the liquid but it still pretty and enjoyable,1
unreliable quality i have got one of those and it was so cloudy that i was hardly able to see the lava plus the lava did not move at all after several tries i was very dissatisfied and returned the item and got the same thing from directly target website this time it clear and works fine though it takes about NUMBER hours to warm up but i think it normal for new lava lamps so i am very happy with my new lava lamp i do not know the reason but i guess somehow lava lite does not have a good quality control on its products if you are lucky you get a good one but chances are also high that you might get a dysfunctional one so order it at your own risk,0
elizabeth and alexandra this is not the book for people interested in the romanovs its a silly misleadingbizzare historical novel so much misinformation is given that it shouldnt even be called historical do not waste your money like i did,0
read the fineprint overall this is a good collection of gospel and spiritual music i would not however have called it a soundtrack when aside from the classic theme song is music that helped inspire the creation of the show the standout track to me was amy grant contribution,1
simplistic i teach strategic management in the mba program and do not recommend that this book be used the cases are very dated and industry restructuring as well as poor coverage of new technologies such as the internet make this book tedious reading miller also fails to include several theories and frameworks such as porter industry analysis which gives spotty coverage to some areas the international dimension is also very poor the assumption is that international environments are similar to domestic environments and a pursuit of profits miller definition of success is all that is needed in both for companies simplistic,0
superb version of a fine heinlein story have spacesuit will travel is one of the best of heinlein so called juveniles which i have always believed were some of his best writing and now it is available is a really excellent audio recording the full cast audio treatment takes a great story and makes it come alive highly recommended,1
replacement of a lost book having moved twice in eighteen months it was inevitable that a few things went missing this book was a replacement and is the same edition i had for years the condition was as advertised delivery was prompt i am happy to have it on the heinlein shelf in my library i just wish i could get my grandchildren to read heinlein instead of playing video games,1

this movie was so funny i think that anybody that has a sense of humor would really like this movie my brother rented it and i fell off the couch like NUMBER times because i was laughing so hard,1
a truly underated comedy i have no idea why this movie did as bad as it did in my opinion it was a truly fun film it had a great mix of sports gags and situational comedy matt stone and trey parker had so much fun doing this i could not stop laughing at dian bachar he was incredibly funny as squeak do not miss out on this film funniest movie of NUMBER,1
movie history in the making move over star wars and make room for this fabulous and wicked movie the two outragouse creaters of south park have done it again and pulled out another comedy great only that one was actually funny and successful and the other is a guarenteed qualifier for the worst movie ever made in the history and the face of this rock we live on watch this movie and you are automatically part of somthing special the other end of the spectrum of what the movie industry has to offer,0
hilarious this movie is hilarious i saw it with my friend and we laughed throughout the entire thing,1

leonides it not the kind of music u can listen to every day but his playing is awesome something to marvel,1
a mess if you are in the mood for a film arranged around the relentless overenunciated narration of a surpassingly bland main character watch out is the film for you i beg everyone else looking for the kind of shocks and outrageousness behind this film advertising campaign not to make the mistake i did put on a blindfold and pick out anything by russ meyer herschell gordon lewis or guy maddin and count your blessings,0
good movie i have tried to watch this movie several times on tv but always either miss the beginning or have to stop watching it before it over i was so glad to find this available in dvd i was able to watch it in its entirety without commercials it a very good movie i highly recommend it,1

a really good book i remember reading this when i was a kid i always thought it was a pretty neat book time travel is always a cool thing to read about and this one is pretty good too one of the best things i remember is writing a letter to the author she wrote me a full length letter back for an NUMBER year old kid that quite a thrill i recommend this book for any children book library,1
ok but not the best or newhere near it i understand where she was coming from and each of the characters problems i am only in eighth grade but i know that this is real life and how people react to different things however the characters did not do anything about their problems carson mccullers must have been dumped or something when she wrote this book because it very depressing the thing i do not understand is why people would want to read about real life when we already live it we all know what life is like so what is the point of this book it took me so long just to read a chapter i did not get into it at all the book just makes you want to commit suicide or something the only reason i read it was to get a good grade well at least i get NUMBER for getting an a in my stupid english class u know how they say never judge a book by it cover well this book is a way more boring than the cover take my word for it,0
best american literature the heart is a lonely hunter began as a short under a different title and eventually was completed as this masterpiece of a novel that has earned it place in the best of american literature mcculler story takes you into the south in another time but what she wrote about then still rings true in the heart of the human soul her is a story of human wants desires needs loss and the true human condition there are single sentences alone in this book that will take your breath away as mccullers simply puts into words what we can never seem to find the words to express what we feel what we want i loved this book and seriously believe everyone should consider reading the heart is a lonely hunter after discovering mcculler work through this book i have continued to read other books such as clock without hands and others she has become among my favorite authors of all time,1
loved it this book which reminded me of to kill a mockingbird even though the two are completely unrelated was very good it about confused and lonely teenagers a crazy deaf greek and lonely man and how they meet and react with each other tres interessant,1
did it really take all these pages to detail nothing oprah book club has lost a lot of its credibility with this book this book just seemed to go on and on and on without anything really happening it babbled on for something like NUMBER pages to document the following things a quasi homosexual relationship between two mutes a revolutionary drunk a snotty pretentious doctor who babbled on about karl marx yawn how long is it going to be before people let him go a white trash girl who loved music save your money and your time,0
for those who love to read the lonely hunters i always love delving into a well written even complex book and getting into the minds of the characters i was not bored or disappointed at all by this book it is a book that will appeal to those who feel caught between irony and faith or for people who are searching for truth and something to give a lonely life fulfillment,1
i tried i have read so many of oprah book selections and for the first time i am truly disappointed i am unable to finish the novel it moves slowly and i catch myself losing focus while reading sure i get the connection with the characters and the writing is pretty good but it is extremely dull and tedious to read i feel like i am back in hs torturing myself to read a book this is not what reading is supposed to be after reading these reviews i guess i will just read the last page to see what happens sorry oprah,0
disappointed i was also disappointed with this book i heard oprah talking about how great it was and i found it a struggle to read i was easily distracted when reading this book overall a big disappointment,0
i agree its boring i wish i would have read these reviews before i picked up the book at the local booksellers i kept waiting for something good to happen but alas it never got to the level i expected,0
unremitting bleakness of life i coud not stop thinking while i was reading this i could not stand more than a hundred pages that it was a brilliant work for a very sensitive depressed lonely highly intelligenttwenty something writer who was not made like other folks and for many artists that a necessary evil i havent read anything else by her and i do not think i will i have a feeling life does not get better in the works of carson mcculler and that too bad the writing is much better than ok but this work is amateurish in structure there is no impelling story of any kind just a wearing down gets to be boring pastiche of miserable and semi miserable characters going nowhere except into a future of deepening misery and despair yes there are pleanty of folks like that but nothing redeems them here mccullers is a southern grotesque who lacks the vitality of flannery and the enduring humanity and brilliance of william faulkner,0
how to study your bible this is an excellent book very helpful if you are unsure how to study a your bible or if you have been haphazard in doing so it has made and will continue to make my time alone with god more inclusive unforgettable and even more precious to me thank you kay arthur for making this available to us nada davis,1

famous arias i purchased this a few years ago and found it extremely useful now i can not find the original and am ordering another copy i found it practical useful correct the right size etc and would recommend it to anyone who is serious about opera,1
good concept bad execution this kid acoustic guitar looks really nice but when it comes to using it we had to duct tape the tuner knobs in order to keep the strings in place and we had to use a lot of duct tape the guitar is of no use if the strings will not stay in place and without duct tape we could not get one string to play now that it is all duct taped my NUMBER year old does enjoy it but the toy should not have to be duct taped in order to work properly,0
product is misrepresented this item is misrepresented in the description it comes with a strap that can not be attached without buying and installing an end pin and it says it comes with a pitch pipe which was not included the product details are misleading and although the price is good you do not get what you think you are paying for,0
strong material this is a very strong effort that deserves to be rewarded with higher sales than it has logged so far breach is at its best when it is focused on the relationship between people and fortunately that where most of the focus lies the people on this album seem to occupy the same mythic landscape as those on the early springsteen albums where life and death intermingle and all battles are epic the only real weak spot for me is murder NUMBER which sounds kind of like an afterthought compared to the fully wrought songs elsewhere sleepwalker is of course one of the strongest rock singles in some time but what surprises me is that the sparkling i have been delivered has not broken through on radio yet witness is another high point highly recommended,1
the opposite of ten pearl jam have changed considerably since NUMBER debut ten and this excellent collection of songs mirror a band clearly more at ease with life than they were in the early NUMBER s lead single nothing as it seems makes up for it lack of bite with the exploration of soundscapes born in the mid west while light years and thin air show a subtlety in the band personality that went previously unexplored my only gripes are with the absence of a real grabber like jeremy or rearviewmirror and the trowaway nature of grievance but hell i am only nitpicking lovely,1
they have lost it pearl jam died and this was the nail in the coffin gone are the furious beats of vs the melodic enchant of ten and the pure grunge soul of vitalogy all i hear is a weak tired band that has run out of fuel,0
a poor job by a great band i bought this album because i am a big pearl jam fan when i first listened to it i was suprised how boring it was i figured i just needed to let it grow on me so i listened to it again a couple of days later unfortunatley i found that it was still monotonous and the songs tend to run together because they sound so similar i still think pearl jam is a great band with a lot of talent but this album does not have the energy or creativeness that makes them that way if you have every other pearl jam album buy this one to complete your set if you do not pick one ot the others,0
doing the evolution in some respects i think yield is a better album but binaural still suffices for greatness binuaral contains three songs that are not pearl jam caliber though they sound to be at first god dice sleight of hand and long road NUMBER parting ways thriteen songs in the album minus NUMBER equal NUMBER all of which are songs that could be played over and over again some may argue for god dice and i am not say that it is bad either the strength of the album is its quirkiness and the band being able to compose songs that have natural sound to them i think that been key to their success key words that loom in binaural are quirkiness as in rival and soon forget supressed rage as heard in greivance and mind playing guitars that seem to want to spin into something off of vs but instead retain driving composure as in of the girl insignificance what can you say vedder and the boys just keeping doing it,1
binaural my view binaural is a mix of the new sound of pearl jam with the drummer matt cameron it great to hear eddie playing different instruments like the ukele somehow pj sounds traditional in this age of boy groups and pop music in NUMBER they released the album yield songs like in hiding and given to fly were ballads that showed off the mild rocking side of pj now on binaural you have songs like breakerfall and light years that have simmilar rocking styles nothing as it seems gives off the a pink floyd sounding background guitar by mcready overall after listening to the new album twice it has grown on me,1
the band that just will not go away this has to be the most boring album of all time right up there with yield riot act and no code i do not know what it going to take for this band to finally call it quits they have no talent and their lead singer just mumbles into the microphone you can not understand a word he saying if you are looking for a fresh sound you can not go wrong with a band like creed they are talented and they have passion for their work not like these washed up has beens pearl jam has no real talent warning this album is horrible listen to the song previews and you will agree with me,0
a valient effort remember the days when pearl jam was good back in good ol days with nirvana and other grunge bands this was a valient effort from a once good band but thats all it was an effort i hate to break the news to everyone but pearl jam is dead and this cd ceartainly is not helping bring them back from the dead save your memories of pearl jam when they were good and save your money,0
santana has done it again eh literally yep santana comes back yet once more with the same formula lots of big names in the music biz packed in a nice album with him and his band playing to them end of formula is the album bad not by any means if you isolate it from the rest of his musical production but if you consider this guy has been putting out significantly more original material in years past listening to more of this santana guitar sound accompanying some big name in the music business is quite dissapointing once more i feel fortunate for having napster i would not buy this album not even for its contagious opening hermes my advice is simple skip it i give it two stars for what it worth production wise but nothing else,0
do not treat your fans like criminals with copy protection rootkits software this santana album has mediamax copy protection software embedded in the cd the problem with this cd is that the mediamax program installs undisclosed and in some cases hidden files on users windows computers potentially exposing music fans to malicious attacks by third parties the infected cds also communicated back to the record company about customers computer use without proper notification this is unacceptable and it will make me think twice before buying another santana album also if the record company wishes to treat me like a criminal and take away the right to make a personal copy of music i purchase because of a few bad apples then it should realize that it will lose its few remaining customers santana please release this cd without these copy protection schemes and i will buy it thank you,0
another sellout sorry diehards but carlos is selling out to the mainstream what was once beautiful music from this man has turned into the same crap we hear from every other mainstream artist you see on mtv day in and day out i bought this at a local store cause it was cheap NUMBER NUMBER going to take it out and play frisbee with it tomorrow or give it to the first hip hopper that comes along carlos is no longer a shaman just a shame,0
sony root kiet i was going to get this for my dad for x mass but sorry sony not going to get you lost out on my money because i am not going to give my father a virus guess i will get the next cd on his list,0
i wish i could hear it i can not beieve it same crap i found my last chris botti it does not play it may be ok in my cd player in my truckno response from web help i have the latest version of windows media player and directx since i only have windows NUMBER my work computer which i can not upgrade not my personal computerlast disc i buy from sony end of subjectmad as hellarista is part of sony,0
if you use an ipod and a pc forget this cd you can not transfer music from this cd to ipod if you are using a pc that alone is enough to turn me off since that is the only way i listen to music these days sorry santana i am not interested enough to even bother although i have been a fan for many years and sony well you confirmed that for this consumer you just ceased to exist you installed software on my pc without telling me what it would do and without informed consent your rootkit technology has proven to be very dangerous for consumers seriously compromising pc security i currently do not own anything made by sony and that is the way it will stay,0
rootkit because this disc installs a rootkit that slows down your pc and makes your pc easy to hijack by hackers i am not going to order it sony and santana can keep their copy protected cd,0
stuff rootkill i broke this piece of junk in half it did damage to my pc i do not care about losing the cd it the principle release this like a normal cd and i will buy it or i will go to itunes and download and have freedom with the music that after i find a way to get rid of the virus this thing infected my pc with my computer has since been hacked sell me a virus and you can keep it i will never buy garbage with this kind of software attached again no matter who the artist,0
all than he is not santana sells out i rated this one quite generously that one star was awarded just to santana name because this music almost makes me feel cheated santana in my opinion is one of the greatest gutarists of all time sure there are the technical masters such as malmsteen and vai but no one has the same feel as carlos santana it just a shame that he would take all of his talent and throw it away on garbage like this if you actually like this music then have fun jump off a bridge but if you agree that santana is better than this than check out anything else the earlier the better and definately go live overall this album makes me wannt to throw up santana replaces all the beautiful spanish sound and soulfull chord progressions with pop garbage do not buy it,0
what is this carlos what can i say about this album of the great carlos santana sorry carlos but i will say ugh please come back to play with his band,0

this is a terrible album if you are considering buying this album i say you probably enjoy it but if you have any respect for yourself and the people around you please forget it and buy something less terrible,0
the best debut cd ever this band is amazing like everybody else the first song i ever heard was absolutely story of a girl and i bought the cd because that song was great but the rest of the cd is even better if i am sometimes crazy and all the other songs on the cd are gorgeous they should not be compared to other five person bands like matchbox NUMBER or vertical horizon because they blow the hell out of those bands nine days are five truly gifted musicians who deserve to go platinum one million times over everyone should by this cd because i guarantee there is not one track on it that will disappoint you nine days is a breath of fresh air in the music world and should not be missed buy this cd,1

great c d i love this c d nine days are absolutely great they have depth and meaning to all their songs and though some people have said that all the songs sound alike i disagree so anway basically like my title says it a great c d,1
biased but mirrors u s version purchased book thinking it was the u s version of the book but received the international version not to be used in the u s according to the cover of the book to date the book mirrors the u s version exactly page for page question for question my only comment would be that the book is biased towards a u s view i thought this was quite strange for an international management book and the international version no less some sections and stories appear to speak more negatively about other counties and paints the united states in a more positive light it was my assumption that a book dealing with international subjects would be more objective and state the factual differences and similarities to managing in other countries and cultural differences,0
where is rod where has rod stewart gone this is so bad that i could not even finish listening to the cd i am such a big rod stewart fan but i think his glory days are over i have had my fill of his remakes at this point do not waste your money on this one,0
loved this album we love this album so glad we did not read the negative reviews or we probably would not have bought it we heard the television promo with some of the song highlights and immediately went to amazon and pre ordered it we take it with us on car trips and love to sing along it is a peppy and a fun companion for the car we would have given it NUMBER stars if it had leave virginia alone on it that was one of his biggest hits and one we also enjoy if you like the songs on the album by all means by it and forget about what the negative reviews say about rod it is a good album and he does not deserve the criticism,1
still the same great rock classics of our time rod stewart rod is always good i liked this because of the songs not a bad one on it he did good good driving music,1
rod adds nothing to these classic tunes as someone else wrote in review rod sounds like he singing to a karaoke track the backing instrumental tracks in most cases especially have you ever seen the rain sound like they were created by turning a tape recorder on and copying directly from the original song boring also on day after day rod drummer uses identical fills at the identical spots badfinger drummer played his the album is very uninspired however it was clever of him to record it a heartache because most people compared bonnie tyler to stewart when she released that tune yrs ago this is the NUMBER st rod album i have bought since sing it again rod and this is not even close to the quality of that release as most people said rod has enough money if he will not write or perform any new original material anymore he should think about packing it in he had a nice run,0
cool breeze this honeywell product is excellent it works quietly and easily circulates air while providing the desired breeze i believe the unit will outlive its generous warranty and would not hesitate to purchase another one if and when it should wear out,0

superb story i enjoyed this book there were mysteries inside of mysteries and it was fun to read all the time i speculated as to possible outcomes,1
a book to live by in my yoga classes the instructor would read a passage before we began each practice something to meditate on but i only have class NUMBER times a week so i found the book very easily on amazon it was way more inexpensive that i had imagined so i ordered a NUMBER nd one for a friend i have only ready through day NUMBER on my new book but i absolutley love it i really appreciate how it is broken down into short but insightful daily readings i read a passage in the morning before i am even out of bed now and have the day to soak it in then read the same passage again before i go to sleep with a new perspective i see myself reading this book over over again for many years a great book to really live the yoga lifestyle by,1
yoga for thinkers as one who has never attended a yoga class i am fascinated by this book because i feel as though i am doing yoga as i sit and read and think read and think yoga is so much more than being on a mat although that experience is certainly most central to the discipline what i am discovering is the meaning of the discipline i am able to envision the physical movements as i sort out mentally the meaning of my imagined activity because gates puts his readers through stages of using their minds he also expects those readers to repeat those stages over and over in repeating the exercises readers bring new thoughts and experiences to the reading activity and each exposure is different from the last one as such the book is always new exciting provocative mysterious riveting,1
one in a million rolf gates book is the kind of blessing that only comes around with the regularity of haley comet by his blending of quotes personal experience and yoga instruction he accomplishes something of serene wonder his book conveys the very heart of yoga for it reaches the reader on a level beyond words phrases or didactics using the book as a daily inspirational guide the seeker can find and find abundantly,1
great story but watch the language got this book because it was on the sunshine state readers list for NUMBER grade problem author uses language that is inappropriate for this age group several uses of the word bu another fa and several b b which i find inappropriate for NUMBER NUMBER year old kids my local public elementary school will not even stock the book why would mr fogelin do this to an otherwise great kids book,1

travel water bowl best suited to smaller breeds i gave this a two star rating based on the fact that mine was to be used for a larger dog this product would be adequate for a small dog but the opening for a dog with a larger muzzle is not large enough the claims for not spilling water seem to be true however since only about an inch of water is in the bottom of the opening at any time it more difficult for a larger dog to get his nose in and get a good drink i guess if the dog were extremely thirsty and had no other water supply this could do in a pinch,0
nice great to have a large capacity water container that is made to minimize spills good for travel and kennel recommend to all who travel,1
great travel water bowl i am happy with this product and they are spill proof as stated i would love to see a cover to make this product leak proof too if you lay the travel water bowl flat they do not spill however they do spill if you place them in an upright position i place these in the freezer and then take these to the fields to water the dogs while we are planting my chocolate lab has no problem drinking from this product,1
incredible the name of this book is what caught my eye but as soon as i opened it i realized how great it is i learned of quite a few mistakes i make and often why the author somewhat ranting tone makes an otherwise dense and boring subject a bit more approachable i highly recommend this book,1
novice user but good enough to see a good stick i just received this stick today i am anxious to take it home and try it out i can say it is smooth straight and glides through my fingers with ease the weight is perfect for what i am looking for and it feels like a perfect fit if this stick performs as well as it looks and feels i may have just found the sticks to fill my rack as far as the shipping goes it was delayed at first but when they did ship it it literally got here the next day i have absolutely no complaints about the shipper if it fails to meet my expectations i will update this on an as needed basis,1

a huge disappointment i have to admit this cd is my most major disappoint so far this year there just does not seem to be much energy left in gvsb i have always suspected that scott mccloud was the real talent behind this group and he the only one who still sounds like he holding up the rest of them just fizzle this impression was reinforced when i saw them peform at the mercury lounge on a trip to new york a few weeks ago mccloud came through barely but the others acted half dead johnny temple in particular seemed out of it i was pretty close to the stage and he looked sort of tired and stressed so maybe he was having an off night i hope so otherwise it looks like this is going to be gvsb last hurrah,0

poor sound quality for the price compared to shure e NUMBER cs the rival they are going for it just does not match up for almost the same price they offer a higher noise isolation i have compared them in outdoor environments,0
creative zen aurvana in ear headphones they make it sould like these are active noise canceling headphones they are also priced like they are however they are just over prices bud headphones,0
comfortable but these are very comfortable small and light and they block the ambient noise very well there are a couple of major problems however one is that the chord is microphonic it transmits a loud scraping sound to the earpieces when it rubs on your face or clothing the other is the response the only other earphones i have to compare it against are the ultimate ears super fi NUMBER a k a altec lansing uhp NUMBER the zen suffers very badly by comparison it has an uneven frequency response with a bump in the mid treble range around NUMBER khz to NUMBER khz that makes it sound shouty another nit is that there is no room in the supplied carrying case for the airplane connection adapter,0

ceramabryte scraper this tool is small for nice storage and use the razor or sharp edge works perfect on my flat top stove for scraping off burnt on stuff before i use the rest of ceramabryte prodects to clean it the razor appears to be replaceable,1
not worth the money skip it this book is a waste of money it contains dated information and it is not well organized you could find better data on google i was looking for a list of addresses for softball and volleyball players and there is no place in the book to find names that are grouped by sport save your money take a few minutes and look up the information yourself a real mess,0
the book was mostly just boring a few of the chapters were interesting i liked the ones about slave revolts but the rest were about people talking about war the sugar interest or other very boring things i had to read this book for school and was supposed to take notes but the book was so boring that i could not find the main idea of many chapters the most interesting characters in the book did not even exist and the historical ones were hardly even mentioned for a historically acurate book caribbean is hardly acurate and i would not read this one just for fun,0
hypocrite lecteur ladies and gentlemen of the jury submitted for your consideration the predators by mark washburn and robert webb stein and day NUMBER from the jacket blurb the fiercest creature in the sea is the great white shark the fiercest creature on land is the kodiak brown bear what happens when they are doomed by human predators to fight each other in the fiercest specatator sport ever imagined can human perversity encompass a combat between a twenty foot great white and a two thousand pound kodiak for the sake of entertainment big time promoter augie zisk is certain it can and when the scheme is first brought to him he says only one word cable ten million people will pay to watch an exhibition on television and general hidalgo de carazonzo will be happy to host the show in his banana republic a neglected and now hideously cannibalized masterpiece for shame mr bachelder,0
not funny no real plot poor satire not well written i was greatly disappointed with bear v shark i expected something funny it is not i expected satire and political humor it has none if the author was trying for a book like NUMBER or brave new world or fahrenheit NUMBER or animal farm or the jungle he missed by a huge margin truly good satire tells a story and makes a message bearv shark does neither the book is so inconsistent and difficult to follow that it becomes almost unreadable it reminded me of the ramblings of a psychiatric patient was that the author intent i did finish the book hoping it would wind up in a glorious manner but it just plods along and ends none of the characters are in any way believable none of the situations are engaging none of the attempts at humor are funny i was really really disappointed did the other reviewers actually read this book,0
a lot of syrup this dvd has a few really enjoyeable songs it is one of those videos that seeing it one time is enough there are some good history points and traveling interest daniel explains and good scenery of ireland which make the video palatable too much video footage is of daniel himself i would recommed buying this dvd if you can get it for a low price,0

not worth it i purchased this in february NUMBER it died in late july NUMBER in that span of time i had used the gun perhaps NUMBER times for a total of no more than NUMBER hours of cumulative use then last saturday the gun just died i happened to notice a bit of sparking though the vents in the lower housing and then that was all they wrote for the heat gun it does have a NUMBER year warranty but for what it would cost me in shipping i would rather put that money towards another to replace it which is what i plan to do judging from other reviews on this heat gun it pretty much hit and miss you might get a good one or like a bad one my suggestion look for a product that has far more hits than misses,0
nice toy poor training device the hardware itself is well built the display is high contrast and easy to read and the buttons have a good feel and are laid out rationally the problem is with the software the biggest problem is the fact that this device has the dealer stand on NUMBER hard or soft not NUMBER making the device useless for practicing basic strategy there are a few other quirks with the software a player three or more card NUMBER wins instantly no push against a dealer NUMBER also the dealer does not expose his natural allowing you to double down or split against it and lose twice but also allows you to surrender against it you are only allowed to double down on a NUMBER or ace a rule seldom found in shoe games an ace NUMBER combination shows up as NUMBER not NUMBER but settles the bet correctly if you stand and due to screen size limitation you must stand on any six card hand fortunately so must the dealer all in all a nice toy but not a serious blackjack trainer,0
not a top quality blackjack toy for the money the blackjack game does not exhibit odds you can not double down on multiple hands las vegas permits you doing this the hit button is overly sensitive two cards are dealt instead of one i question about the true randomness of the cards dealt,0
xr NUMBER s and tri whammers okay so i made those words up they are not actual military terms buried in this tom clancy book though i doubt that anyone except submarine and naval experts would even notice i have never heard of an author doing too much research for a book i think clancy lost touch with the everyday reader if he thinks anyone would understand enough of the jargon he spews here to care about this book and when jargon is all a book offers characters what characters the book to put in simple non clancian terms sucks clearly it not the dumbest book i have ever read but it is the worst i make it a mission never to stop a book once i have started and never to refuse reading a book given to me this book made me question the value of such a mission too boring too long too technical too empty,0
a good idea made into a bad novel this novel is very long and boring when clancy describes the submarine battles the text results heavy and very difficult to follow in fact the novel contains too many technical details about the weapons the book would be better if it contained more references about the persons and i have to say that i think that this novel has a excess of NUMBER pages the spanish edition of plaza y janes has almost NUMBER pages in small format,0
greatest contemporary war story ever written i read this book while stationed in germany in the late eighties and its still one of the greatest reads i have ever had the story is so believable especially if you have been to the cities he writes about as well as having trained for such a scenario great book,1
severe printing errors i have not yet read the entire book though i do quite enjoy what i have read this edition of the novel suffers from some very severe printing errors namely the first NUMBER chapters or so are out of sync with the rest of the book the first page of the book is page NUMBER and there seems to be fragments of a forward and an author note printed throughout this section the rest of the book appears okay though,0
crap this was pretty crap none of the kids like them and they are not amazing at all my kids threw them in the trash first day just a waste of money,0
its a rip off there is only one page of useful info in the entire book i am not kidding one page everything else is fluff to sell a book i thought it might be fun to read in bed w my girlfriend negative the one page has a fairly accurate diagram of the vagina w some arrows that say rub here everything else was crap and a waste of time i guess if you are a terrible lover who does not try and please your woman it could be marginally useful but not in comparison to most texts out there if you know it important to get your girl turned on before going to work than all you need out of this book is that one page look it up on the net and save your money,0
not a toy it actually a very poorly made and easily damaged costume the purple color comes off in a strong breeze therefore it is very overpriced mine arrived with the fabric pre ruined but i do not have time or funds to make buy another costume you are much better off just buying a wig and putting the rest of the costume together yourself,0
zumo NUMBER the zumo works great it well built water proof and easy to use i was able to down load a route like i wanted and it followed it to a tee you have to set it to off road mode the fuel gage is nice to have it gives you a heads up before the low fuel light comes on i wish it would show the speed limit like my nuvi does i would recommend it and i would buy another one,1
great for motorcycle if you ride a bike you need one of these the only complaint i have is with the bluetooth it has two channels of bluthooth but has a very limited amount of phones that it will work with most of them are very old model if you hook up a phone not on the list it will pair up but if you also pair up a headset then it goes crazy once i found an old phone motorla razr it works great,1
takes a licking and i take the unit off the bike every time i stop i do not trust the locking screw one time i did not fully secure the gps into the cradle while going down the road at NUMBER miles per hour it flew off i thought great there NUMBER down the drain i circled back and picked up the device it was banged up in a few places the corners were completely scuffed i turned it on and it worked i have fully tested it and everything works it now NUMBER days since the incident all in all a good gps for those of us who are a little rough on our hardware,1
broke down in NUMBER weeks product just quit working NUMBER weeks after i got it sent it back to manufacturer garmin who said they would have it fixed on a priority and over nighted back to me that was almost two weeks ago and have not gotten it back yet still waiting,0
great gps even though the price is more than what i wanted to pay it was worth it i like the choices of voices and ease of use like all gpss you have to get use to inaccuracies during your trip it good to study your route before heading out sometimes common sence is better than the gps itself battery life is good just wish it would work with my current cell phone env,1
love it though the price is something you have to consider most i love the vest style quality and even the color my son got the blue one and he loves it from the beginning it very soft comfortable and stylist that helps him floating very well of course with the help of his father to make his head up it does not take long for a NUMBER year old boy to get used to it too not like the fabric vest this one does not stick to his skin and it dries out very quick we had a very good time in the pools and had a hard time to pull him out of the water absolutely a good purchase it deserves every penny,1
so cute this hat is honestly one of the very cutest things i have bought for my daughter thus far everyone comments on it wherever we go and thankfully there is plenty more room for her to grow into it it been machine washed and dryed several times with no problems no fading fraying shrinking or pilling super cute,1

from jazz to eternity starting with some hot but slightly populist swing then turning to schmultzy this word does not exist but i think you get my drift pop evergreen and then covering the field from top class jazz and blues to country dinah really shines at this cd trust me on that one or listen yourself a jazz fan like myself could wish for a jazzier selection but then again jazz fans probably already have some of her fienst jazz work tributes to bessie smith jamming with clark terry maynard ferguson clifford brown hank jones terry gibbs buck clayton and others swinging hard with lionel hampton or red norvo this is a perfect introduction to dinah washington entire career and her vastly diverse opus hopefully it will lead some to explore her jazz legacy not as consistently excellent as sarah vaughan jazz opus but equally great and powerful when she hits it right with her mighty voice,1
gim me a piece of beefcake beefcake is a documentary and a gem of a movie all rolled into one its focal point is the physique magazines of the NUMBER and NUMBER the director shows the steamier and more homoerotic side as if it needed more of one of these magazines it also covers how they came to be and why they dissappeared off of magazine shelves before watching the movie i knew very little about it except that it was gay themed and discussed muscle boys even though i really could not care less for muscle boys i still watched the movie and i am glad i did it colors are very visually stimulating and the images are great the documentary moments are amusing and the film moments are even funnier i would reccomend this movie to anyone who wants to laugh and just enjoy a good movie,1
stamina electronic mini stepper the stepper is tough to use at first but that probably because i am out of shape i have used it several times but not on a regular basis the only probably i have is that it hard to maintain your balance at times otherwise it a great little exercise medium for the price and i like it because it small enough to put away anywhere,1
a great must have book this thing really works i tried the exercises and noticed huge improvement in my memory and the ability to visualize things in a way i had never dreamed before,1
best book this is the best book in the field of creativity and accelerated learning after only NUMBER minutes i felt that my brain had a really good and hard workout,1
can you say stuffing the ballot box at the time of this writing when i click on all NUMBER reviews all of the NUMBER star reviews on the page reviews NUMBER are written by a reviewer who has reviewed only this book since NUMBER of these NUMBER reviews are NUMBER star reviews i either have to conclude that this book is the most sensational book of the century and inspires people who have never written another review ever to sign up on amazon to do just that for this book or the ballot box is being stuffed here read the more measured reviews and the astute reader will be able to easily discern which of these two possibilities is true i personally do not like it when the seller himself or reviewers associated with the seller do not identify themselves as such when reviewing a product,0

not bad the technique of image streaming has shown promising results in certain cases much of the hype and propoganda however has been that the process can create a NUMBER point gain in iq relying on the NUMBER study by dr charle p reinert the reinert study the following link will take you to the abstract URL study however does not detail a NUMBER point gain in iq through image streaming unless i am reading the abstract wrong it discusses a much lower gain less than half the advertised NUMBER point gain in certain circumstances as for the validity of the test not enough detail is noted in the abstract for one to objectively judge for themselves unfortunately this discrepnancy has resulted in a diminished outlook on this technique to several persons it is unfortunate because the technique is worth learning and can be very beneficial when combined with other cognitive techniques such as the sedona method,1

bad remake this song when sung by berlin was wondeful and not vocally overdone jessica simpson sounds as if she is ripping her vocal chords out to hit some of the notes towards the end of the song none of the remixed are particularly exciting and they all drag on without end unfortunetly it seems as if this entire cd was rushed and hurried along i would save my,0
dropped it and it broke i bought the NUMBER model which is similar worked generally fine but because of its shape easy to drop or fall over i put it on top of my desktop and accidentally it fell on the wooden floor and since then it has not turned on too fragile,0

disappointed i am a big louis prima fan but i was very disappointed with this cd it did not capture the excitement of a louis prima show,0
the importance of community development through statistical and qualitative analysis this book illustrates the importance of community wide development as a key to the economic rejuvenation of the inner city the analysis is comprehensive and provides an excellent resource for individuals and entities involved in community development,1
good overall account of the war in the south i recommend this book for those interested in a clear ande concise narrative account of the american revolution in the south although not as dramatic as buchanan the road to guilford courthouse which i do not recommend lumpkin book is well worth reading and generally accurate his analysis is solid a description i would not give to the road to guilford courthouse,1
good idea but not practical we bought this so that the stroller could have shade from the front it was hard to put on and keep stable and the parts broke easily not worth it,0
an overlooked treasure this is one of the funniest sf books out there i have got an old tattered copy and i will order the new edition when it comes out the book is full of cultural sf and fandom references some might be a little dated for example the symbol of the sheep the horned box is a reference to a tv with antenna and how many people have seen one of those lately but overall this book holds up very well to answer another reviewer question would be a spoiler but anyone who wishes to know who purple was based on can email me at my nickname at hotmail,1

this book is awful this book has no point to it it teaches you common sense stuff it has no value in real life this book is very boring and useless a student can not read this book it is too boring and useless waste of money this is a waste of if you have already bought this book it can be used as pretty good fire wood and that what the one star is for,0
excellent strategy game i got this game for my birthday i am NUMBER and i love it it like a high tech version of chess definitely makes you think hard and try to plot out your moves many steps in advance it especially tricky because you have to simultaneously think offensively and defensively if you like classic strategic boardgames you will love this game,1
cheap i was really excited about getting this for my brother for christmas but when we opened the package the lasers would not fire and we could never get them to work which is the whole point of the game so it pretty much trash now,0
it makes you think it makes you think really hard its like chess on crack its the new age of chess i do not like the form fitting box top which required resetting the pieces in a certain way to put away the game but this probably provides better protection for the mirror surfaces,1
NUMBER yo son loves this game i will start off by saying i have not personally played this game i do not really like chess so am not super excited to play but my son really wanted this for christmas i was a little leary of getting it because we have had laser games that did not work very well in the past and ended up being a waste of money but there was not much he wanted for christmas and the reviews on amazon were good so i got it for him he loves it him and my boyfriend have played numerous times since christmas and they are both addicted to it my boyfriend keeps begging me to play it with him when my son is not around the lasers are very strong and neither of them have complained about having any issue with it working it also seems to be very fast play i do not think it takes them more than NUMBER minutes to finish a game and i love the fact that it is not something that has to be plugged into a tv to play and it makes you think and strategize,1
one of the all time best jazz singers in the pantheon of jazz greats i do not think it an exaggeration to say that nina simone stands right up there alongside greats such as billie holliday her work even compares favorably with the instrumental giants like coltrane or davis she that good this cd is my favorite from simone catalog love me or leave me my favorite song while less socially relevant than some of the other songs on this cd it will leave you wanting to dance however all of the songs on this cd are great some make you want to boogie yes i said it some make you angry some make you want to cry but regardless it hard not to be affected in some way by each of them i also recommend verve nina sings nina cd,1
not for me a reasonable price and a good beginning but what seemed to be a thriller turned into a slow love story with some mystery thrown in was not my cup of tea,0
my first adf book this book was my first exposure to alan dean foster i though the beginning was somewhat slow but it was character development i really loved the pendju but i was upset when i conc was introduced as the story continued to progress i decided that it was actually for the better and turned out to be an excellent book i just wish it was longer had a sequel,1
little train that could not the batteries do not last very long and the train has stopped working after a year of minimal use it still makes the sounds but no longer moves i love the train but would never spend this much again,1

how do you expect people to purchase this item the product description states that the sizing is based on neck size however you do not provide any measurement with the corresponding s m l sizes are we supposed to guess at the measurements it might be easier to shoot darts blind folded,0

a classic with a beautiful wrapping wonderful book timeless advice plus maira kalman her exquisite illustrations pair wonderfully with this major classic,1
great music terrible dvd what the deal i am a huge abb fan and thought this was a great show but what the hell is up with these stupid interviews in the middle of songs right in the middle of solos seriously who would do such a stupid thing it would be a great dvd if they had the whole show uninterrupted why not just put the interviews in a whole different section or disc if you want an allman brothers dvd just get the new one from the beacon and hope somebody finally realizes that this dvd sucks and fixes it,0
disgraceful this dvd is a disgrace pathetic it actually an outstanding film of an allman brothers concert but the producers ruined it by interrupting the songs with interviews how can they be so stupid how can the members of the allman brothers allow the record company to butcher the songs like that do not they have enough interest in their own music to pay attention to what gets released if you want to see the full length versions of the songs in this concert buy the vhs version because it all there as for the dvd release it such a shame that corporations and record labels show such disrespect for music the allman brothers are one of the greatest live bands of all time and there is not very much concert footage that has been released so why did they have to ruin this wonderful concert,0
like others say stay away from the dvd when i bought this and took it home i played it and was severely dissapointd ditto to what most other reviewers said i took it back to best buy the next day it sucks,0
any true allman borthers fan would enjoy this dvd the sound and picture quality are great and the selection of tunes are great also the only annoying thing was the cut in interviews in the middle of a few songs overall a good dvd,1
misleading information on dvd case i am disappointed like the rest i bought the vhs version several years ago and expected an exact copy of it on the dvd wrong to make matters worse the dvd cover says running time approx NUMBER minutes the actual running time is NUMBER minutes what a rip off,0
i am glad i did not trade in my laserdisc what an incredible botch job the laserdisc rocks and i understand so does the vhs version but this dvd cuts out songs cuts up songs and generally dissapoints the interviews should be in addition to not instead off sony get it right and put this out again,0
eye opening read this book if you do not know anything about the writings of st paul so you can get it right straight away read this book if you have read others about the writings of st paul for an enhanced understanding of what you think you understand about him,1
not a practical handbook for today this is a reprint of a book first issued in NUMBER it does have some fascination for instance in the comparison of gas vs oil lighting for your workspace for my purposes as a beginner looking for basic methods for mechanical watch cleaning and repair it was practically useless it gives equal time to fusee and geneva watches and may well be of interest to an experienced person looking for a glimpse into the past but not reccomended as a practical handbook,0

i struggled to pick it up never have i been so bored by a novel set in ireland while i found the historical aspect to be informative the story itself was tedious and silly with the most contrived fictional characters i struggled to pick this book up each night rather than put it down i would rather read a straight history book and visit dublin for my facts and leave the irish fiction to emma donoghue and even maeve binchy,0
a good family game my eight year old son received this gift for christmas this year and he my husband our six year old daughter and i all played it about five times so far it a nice game to play together for a variety of ages and does not get too competitive it a challenge to remember the titles of movies characters and even offers other challenges such as having to figure out the difference between two almost identical pictures etc there is even two ways to play the game a short version and a longer regular version you do need to be by a working tv and dvd player but it is enjoyable and the children tend to get a kick out of seeing the video clues for many questions i recommend this for a family or group of children old enough to work the remote of the family dvd player they even have the rules on the dvd,1
better than NUMBER of what in your cd player there it was NUMBER i heard black metalic for the fist time and i melted into the soundscape that is the catherine wheel cruising in a car was not good enough for the record because the mellower moments could not be audible with out blowing your ear drums on the loud parts god bless this band they take dynamics are taken to the max wishville combines the catherine wheel major strength dynamics and combines it with pure pop sensibility they have nearly perfected that which is the catherine wheel,1
what happened truly a disappointment and that only because catherine wheel need to be held at a very high standard they have produced some fine masterpieces in the past culminating with the show and heart stopping adam and eve additionally when you have the huge talents of tim friese greene at your disposal he created a large part of two other masterpieces talk talk spirit of eden and laughing stock get them you best not surface with mediocrity well they have there no texture no diversions no heavily lidded emotion no cathartic blissful moments of sound new record label firing of their bassist many bands have tried to shake things up mid career hate to see another talented one follow the same fate i am still a fan but this album will surely go to the bottom of the catherine wheel bin for me,0

good case cheap foam insert this case is strongly made and closes well however the included foam inserts are very cheap and offer no support after carefully making cut outs for my xd NUMBER i found that the foam was too feeble to support the gun properly and just looked cheap and saggy after a difficult search on the web i discovered another case maker pelican on ebay that sold replacement foam inserts which i ordered i found these to be of far better quality and well support the gun and accessories in the end it would have been cheaper and easier to have just bought the case from pelican in the first place to be honest even the pelican foam is not as good as the foam i used to use in the uk to carry heavy cameras in alluminum cases that foam had a velvet surface and was extremely firm but god only knows where to buy that,0

excellent as a drama on the lives of prostitutes but only fair as a thriller intelligent if slightly awkward melding of a gritty sad drama of life of the street for working classprostitutes in the uk and a somewhat more melodramatic and soapy if sometimes quite tense serial killer thriller unlike klute where the world of hustling and thriller melded seamlessly here there is a bit moreschizophrenia between the elements for me the crime sections while sometimes effective werealso quite familiar and felt like tv and movies i seen many times before whereas the portrait ofthe day to day lives of hustlers felt like much more interesting and less often explored in anon exploitive way the killings and investigation feel oddly grafted on,1

fear from the boy next door to every girls worst nightmare in a heart beat a thriller that lets you love and hate the same character at the same time twists and turns keep your eyes glued to the television and mark walbergs gentle stare keeps you loving a psychotic the ending keeps those who enjoyed the movie hoping for more an ending scene with police divers keeps those who noticed it wondering was he alive or was he dead just who body were they looking for,1

way too violent for children we just rented this movie and while my NUMBER year old liked it my NUMBER year old was terrified with good reason lots of violence and cruelty that just went on and on i had some babar books as a child and was expecting something similar i was shocked and angry that someone decided to turn it into some kind of a cartoon tarentino movie yes eventually babar does prevail but in the meantime there enough graphic scary imagery to fuel many kid nightmares too many kid movies today seem to be designed for adults and this is definitely one,0

wagner out west most of the young stars here perform very well in a high production western that quite as good as the sum of it parts wagner bad debra paget is good as always but jeff hunter is slightly miscast though he works quite hard i liked the feel of time and place this film has and it still retains a sweep and grandour which must have looked great on its original cinema outing what else can i say i thoroughly enjoyed it even with its shortcommings and can recommend it even on repeated viewings though widescreen works best for the full bodied western vistas,1

dissapointing having gone through the first NUMBER chapters of this book i must say i am really dissapointed the author is supposedly trying to avoid the mathematical rigor to the account of explaining things in a physical way well he almost completely fails in that and the worst confuses the reader for example he devotes NUMBER pages to smoothly introduce the reader to the concept of a manifold promising a more rigorous definition to be given later on when the time comes he uses two brand new concepts namely haussdorf space and countable base for the meaning of which the reader has to look up in other books however cited in bibliography if one wants to understand what all these things manifolds diff forms lie deriv etc are about the best thing to do is buy a mathematical book after all it is hardly possible to satisfactorily describe abstract mathematical concepts if you avoid using mathematical language for the interested i am not a mathematician,0
false advertising although this book may contain over NUMBER NUMBER foods not just NUMBER NUMBER as the synopsis claims it only contains sodium calorie and fat statistics for them i bought this book looking for the potassium values that the synopsis suggested it contains it does not my sole purpose for purchasing this book was falsely advertised in the synopsis and thus this book is absolutely useless to me thanks for nothing,0

too much like work if i want to read a cultural history of the united states in the nineteenth century then i read a cultural history of the united states in the nineteenth century this boring pretentious rambling self involved pontificating mess passes itself off as fiction but it reads like one of those junior high assignments where students are told to imagine themselves living in another time or place how on earth it could have received a national book award is a mystery even considering the spotty reputation of the award one or two times i began to feel swept up in the narrative i appreciated bogdan journal entries his unrequited pining for lovely young boys but quickly enough that narrative flow was dammed by another lengthy boring letter or monologue i would refer those who want to read a masterful book about an eastern european artist coming to america in the nineteenth century to read josef skvorecky in love now there a book,0

a moving call to re examine the bible when i ordered this book i expected it to be a defense of the protestant position of sola scriptura but to my surprise it is instead aimed at correcting liberal christian views of how we form relationships with god the book opens with a story of a christian woman who was waiting for god to tell her directly that she should make amends with her estranged parents when a friend told her to open her bible to exodus NUMBER NUMBER and read the book proceeds in this direction emploring the reader to use his or her bible as a means to form a personal relationship with god rather than expecting god to speak by direct revelation it also briefly defends the authority of the bible against such attacks as higher criticism and the jesus seminar despite the why in the title i would have to say that it is more pastoral than apologetic even so i recommend it,1

more than just a little bit flaky well yeah i saw what the bleep do we know and got very excited and bought all of these books while i appreciate mr emoto subtley and humility in presenting his work it winds up being just as hard to stomach that much of it is thinly veiled hoopla with little or no solid science behind it he fails to explain how many photos he took of each kind of water he photographed for instance there are just too many gaping holes but hey what the bleep do i know when it comes down too it i think this sort of physics philospohy spiritual theory of everything kind of stuff is just as undocumentable and faith based as any other sort of religious ideology more than just a little bit disappointing for those of us who are still looking,0

fabulous book for the young reader this book is based in fact and done so very well i have given it only four stars as the majority of the story such as the dialogues and day to day happenings is fiction the young reader such as my son may very well take that book as all fact the author has done a great job bringing the young reader into the adventures that lewis and clark experienced through the use of seaman the dog her use of historical reference such as the diaries kept my the captains and other written accounts kept by the members of the corps of discovery reflect the importance and difficulties of the jouney seaman is the comic relief in the story and keeps the young reader interested and giggling i learned a few things by reading this book myself as a mother and historian i recommend this book highly for the young reader,1
crap just crap book is highly boring as restates the same thing over and over there is barely any thrilling action and the dog reads more like a background character than the main one the book makes me sleep as the lewis and clark story is the most boring of all american history events and this is of all the crap that is american history because they are just so boring omg they are traveling west wow do i give a plus just because your american and the story is american does not make it great you mother you hope the book rots in hell,0

disappointed having just read vanishing florida by david t warner i was anticipating another look into a native perspective of old florida while warner book was engaging enlightening and entertaining this one was not it was mostly a dry historical perspective of the author family which was not that interesting,0
the author must be an extremely annoying snob for a history book the research and footnotes were not very substantial historians have been getting a lot of negative publicity lately for less that exemplary scholarhip since this is not a very important book it will not be scrutinized the way doris kerns goodwin or joseph j ellis would be if they were to write about florida i felt like someone was snearing at me throughout the book it seemed more like a big long blog i love to read more about florida history since so many friends live there now but i truly hated this book,0

no knowledge to success i could play games and do word processing if i had a problem i would reload my computer and start over i am retired with such outdated skills and physical disabilities that i was unemployable started school at nacc in burbank california went to class for ten weeks on weekends read their texts and then bought a certification before testing i read it through twice took both comptia core and dos adaptive exams the same morning and passed very comfortably without this book to put it together from start to finish i would have had to study longer and harder my only suggestion is in making the operating system architecture section more simplified like it is in a dos windows second edition chapter NUMBER by david groth,1
wow finally i have been looking for a book like this trust me just follow the book through from cover to cover and take notes for things he emphasizes and then do the practice questions in the book and on the cd you will pass the exam make sure you have a computer to screw around with as well his tips can be tested and it will help steer you out of confusing questions on the exam because you know which scenarios will not work i just wrote the core hardware and scored a NUMBER and i expect to do the same for the operating systems exam next week remember comptia tests are adaptive and you only have thirty minutes with his book i was done in eleven minutes way to go mikey keep up the good work every computer technician should have a copy,1
a review this is a plain language very detailed book that i would recomend for some one who knows nothing about computers the hardware section goes into all the detail you need to know for the a and then some all the while it is easy to understand even if you are veging the software section goes into what you will need to know as well but you will need to pay a little more attention to what he is writing about if you want to pass i get the impression this guy really knows what he is talking about a lot of illustrations,1
the best book for a i passed the a core NUMBER and i am going for the dos win this week this book is very good very detail compare with other a book,1
great great quality for the price and does everything i need it to do it is very large like the size of a clothing iron about,1
not worth the we love the idea of this table but found several main problems NUMBER cheaply made the legs on aon put his foot through the hole in one of the benches while standing on it which is very dangerous and if my husband had not been there to catch him he would have fallen over with his foot still stuck in the bench NUMBER stains easily even crayon marks do not wipe off easily from the surface of this table and marker stains are permanentall in all not happy with this product particularly for the price,0
bradbury something wicked this way comes surprised at what a dud this story felt like after my other experiences with bradbury there is a movie version and that is equally awful not at all what i was expecting,0
one of his best how can you go wrong with a ray bradbury story i sent this to my NUMBER year old grandson as an introduction to other fiction,1
it okay there a lot of hype about this being classic literature and one of the best genre books ever i disagree although ray bradbury is a superb writer this book seems to fall short the writing is overly poetic and the dialogue is clunky if you read this you may find yourself re reading sentences to figure out what the hell was being said although not from the book there are many too many sentences like this will ran did not run jumped did not jump he stomped his feet on elephant shadows and cat whisker winds again this is not an actual sentence from the book but something similar to the type of writing buy it read it experience it these reveiws are just a matter of taste anyway the book simply left me,0
something wicked this way comes ray bradbury something wicked this way comes is a tour de force in the over use of metaphor and simile to the point that the reader must strain to follow the actual plot without being led repeatedly astray the author also misuses words intentionally for effect it seems but to no discernible advantage however there is genius in the creative imagination that went into the plot no doubt grist for a successful movie where of course the metaphors and similes fade away as the screen writers and director are forced to visually develop the plot for the viewers in toto an very unenjoyably read,0
loved it something wicked this way comes was a very interesting read for me i do not think i have ever read a book quite like this before this is my first bradbury novel the novel itself it beautifully written at times almost magical bradbury prose is more along the lines of poetry at many points this is a positive and also a negative on the positive side i think it adds an eeriness to the story on the negative side if you are not used to reading this style of storytelling it could very well hinder the story and cause disinterest at first i was put off by the poetic style however the more i read the more i began to enjoy it i love the evil carnival comes to town theme i liked the main characters two kids named will and jim i loved the relationship will has with his father as much as i liked this book i could not give it NUMBER stars i thought the ending was a bit well cheesy for lack of a better word but even with that it was a really good novel and i enjoyed it tremendously,1
not for me so i do not really understand why this is considered a horror novel i feel that it was made for children and bradbury writing style is a little confusing at times and kind of bland i thought of it as more of an adventure story then anything if you want something that is scary then this is not for you i am a huge horror book nut but this book just did not do it for me at all,0
best book ever this may be the best book ever written by a human being next to the bible and shakespeare there are few better books this is one of the first books i ever read on the chronic pain problems around the world and how to get over them her work with people suffering from chronic pain is an inspiration to writers everywhere the stories of people being misdiagnosed as simply depressed was insightful it is a clear and easy to read book yet it has many detailed facts and interviews i was suffering from chronic pain greatly when i read this and her chapters on herbal vitamins to take helped me greatly i was very moody before and this helped without drugs her tips on how to write about your pain to help get outside your pain very insightful i loved this book and i think it is a great work for anyone dealing with chronic pain,1
great book i think this is a great book for anyone who might suspect they have endo or was just diagnosed with it it was a great read lots of info,1
emily richrds needs a recording contract i just love her music especially lie to me she captures the passion and essence of love and life it like listening to the energy people give off i wish more people could experience her trur talent good driving stuff,1
specialized area of interest excellent book got it as a gift for one who loves this writer he enjoyed it very much,1
thumbs up c balance is an excellent product from a trusted hobbyist turned vendor julian sprung this is also the best price available anywhere,1
too bulky when i put this on my car visor it was visually distracting and made me feel claustrophobic having NUMBER cds hanging over my head is just not a good idea i tried to give it to my husband but he thought the same thing and got a smaller one that holds NUMBER cds much better,0
terrible book considering that this book is the NUMBER th edition i would not want to see what the previous editions looked like this book is full of mistakes both editorial and technical do not buy this book unless you absolutely have to for a class if you do have to look for the best price on a used book do not bother to buy a new one you will not want to keep it this book has some of the worst examples i have ever seen the examples are so convoluted that there usually is not a straight forward answer to most of the problems this has been verified by looking in the instructors version of the book,0
not polished or put together very well i had to buy this book for a masters degree course i think a fair amount of data is contained within the text but the organization style is not that good the author drops hints that he has been writing this book for a long time and that it has helped some major names in the database world find inspiration that all well and good but a good book does this not make the price is obviously way too much for something that is not really a practical guide most of the people that buy it will likely only be buying it because they are forced to what a shame it would be much nicer to have a quality product to learn from this is not it in my opinion it could be done better,0
nice item for what it does i used this adapter with my canon sx NUMBER is to place polaraized coloraized and neutral filter of NUMBER mm i like big filters better i to zoom a little to get rid of the black corner but is perfect after that,1
predictable simplistic and boring i found this book to be so predictable the story line was too simple there was no depth to the story or to the characters and i had a hard time sticking with it the whole story focuses on this woman issues with her own father that she then transfers to the father of her student how do they fall in love i have not a clue because there was absolutely no story there to give that scenario any meat or background i am just saying i see the author has other books i hope they are better for the sake of those who buy them,0
a very delicate writing a curiosity of between a fiction and a true story makes me read this book i really like the lover it one of my favorite book to recommand others even though i do not like much duras the writing is so short like pieces of puzzle there is no order to explain duras wrote what she felt thought spontaneously in a paragragh after another this book is descriptive and the flow of feelings is so delicate especially the reflections about the life that duras explained in this story are truly profound and even sorrowful for me there is no tension no exposed conflict the story moves so still like the calm ocean the tranquility in rich thoughtful description that why i like this novel,1
hard to follow i do not care for the author abuse of the time line duras character development is firm but her flashbacks are ill timed and confusing duras message of using the women body as a form of control and yet making the main character seem separated from her body does not seem to really say anything,0
one dominant flavor that did not work for me personally i would not buy this particular yogi tea again because i hate the taste of licorice anise the flavor of the licorice and fennel seed is very dominant making it a sort of sickly sweet flavor which was not what i was hoping for with my burning throat i think a better blend would be something with more heat like ginger which is why i usually drink yogi cold season instead for the same purpose with a sore throat its reasonable to suffer through a yucky flavor if it makes a discernible difference but this tea did not do that,0
oh lord this is the definitive count basie williams album it does not get any better than this of special credit everyday easily the best arragement ever please send me someone to love ditto etc etcbuy itlisten to itlove it,1
blown away i had the great pleasure of spending some time with johnnie lee and her dear friend asia about NUMBER years ago she told me she was a singer but i never had the opportunity to hear her perform until now all i can say is wow i am truly proud of her this disc is nothing short of sensational rock blues jazz johnnie lee has all the bases covered and with an incredible variety of texture and tone there is real passion in every song and some of these melodies had to have been very difficult to master i am so happy to have found quite by accident this incredible cd i hope she reads this review because i was so taken with her way back then that i wrote a character based on her into my novel coincidentally published around the same time that this cd was issued the link is below confluence a noveljohnnie i hope you are well and happy and prosperous this disc deserved to be a big hit if you have any interest in contacting me write to EMAIL,1
what a surprise sincerely i did not expect a surprise like this i went to the theater expecting to see a typical entertaining film i see all the kevin spacey when i got out i had that taste in my mouth that only leave the really good films magnificent interpretations a solid script a good direction and in occasions a splendid bgm is all you will encounter in this film i will not miss it or at least that my opinion,1
k pax two thirds of the way through k pax i decided that only a great ending was going to redeem this movie unfortunately it ended with a skittering thud and had me muttering what the huh kevin spacey and jeff bridges are good enough to make their scenes together interesting but the story is pretty confused a rental at best,0
k krap on the one hand you have got the nuthouse dramas where the mental patient provides deep truths to inmates and staff alike don juan demarco cuckoo nest on the other hand you have got the taoist alien dispensing generic new age advice starman trying to mix the two was a big mistake this movie was way too long way too slow too self involved and overall just dull kevin spacey has done some fantastic work seven american beauty usual suspects but this is is not it also someone said the ending was ambiguous not true prot is robert porter,0
since high school i have had dickies pants shorts on and off since high school i used to skateboard much more than i do now and find that these are quite durable the regular NUMBER pants have the best fit out of all the other selections available the only thing i do not like is they attract lint a little too much,1
great value pants are comfortable wash and wear well i am a truck driver and i get very dirty and a lot of things to get caught on these pant are performing well,1
comfort fit here i bought these dickies work pants we used to call them chinos in the NUMBER s do not ask me why ok so they are comfortable and light to wear not heavy canvas pants which is what bluejeans really you walk around in heavy canvas pants or dungarees and wonder why your legs get tired so easy da anyway i woke up and now i will wear light workpants like dickies and relax i do recommend these to anyone,1
the first iron lady this is an excellent book and a lively and interesting read anne somerset gives an insight into all sides of the character of elizabeth her moods and feelings she was renowned at the time for her short temper both as a woman and a queen the glamour of the tudor court and what it was like to be in or out of favour in a clique where a careless word could in some cases cost you your life elizabeth did not suffer fools gladly and the book examines her religious feelings her sexuality and the way she dealt with conflicts both at home and abroad in what was essentially a man world elizabeth was nobody fool and although she would listen to her advisers she had a mind of her own shrewd and extremely intelligent and was quite capable of using her authority as monarch to make important decisions for herself the book is a delight for anyone with the slightest interest in history,1
poor no good as bad as the curse of the pink panther unwatchable frankly there is only one peter sellers and no doubles can compare just as there is only one herbert lom without whom there is no pink panther either if you are a fan get the s martin remake it is rather good and dryfus is well defined but do skip this one,0
yeah french rap at its best i love it great beats excellent lyrics dope features every euro worth,1
quit with the ads on the clips already wanted to watch the behind the scenes jailhouse rock clip but unfortunately amazon feels the need to ruin it by peddling elvis product with the damn pop ups thru the whole thing maybe if i could actually enjoy the clip i might buy the dvd just because of the annoyance factor i am not you suck amazon,0
speedway okay here is my opinion one of my favorite actors in the whole universe is bill bixby if bill had not been in this movie i would have gave it NUMBER star i have respect for elvis as a singer but he could not act worth a lick this is another typical elvis movie that you just sit through it and by the end of it you think to yourself that you have spent NUMBER years watching this movie i think that what makes me like it a bit is because of bill bixby being in it jenny,0
hurts my teeth these were way too strong for my teeth i used them as directed and towards the end less than directed they gave me long term pain in my teeth about a years worth,0
crest whitestrips excellent product more comments on whiter teeth and nicer smile than i have ever had in my life most everyone noticed w out even a prompted question to them,1
amazing product years ago when the original whitestrips first came out i tried them i had great results and the whitening actually lasted longer than i had expected fastforward a handful of years and i have decided to try the premium strips i am getting braces in a month and i wanted quick results that would last at least through a portion of my treatment i used the premium strips for NUMBER mins lastnight and i had amazing results from only one strip if my teeth keep whitening like this i will have to stop using them before the box is done to prevent having the unnatural glow i was blown away,1
these do not work i promise these do not whiten teeth i have tried them and the commercials are deceiving you will not get the results they show on the commercials i was very disappointed in this product save the money from these and go to the dentist and have a professional zoom whitening there is no way you are going to whiten your teeth at home using these the peroxide is not strong enough the dentist uses over twice the strength of these i do not care how many packages of these you use it will not work also the bottom strips are too small to cover your teeth and they float off in your saliva you are basically ingesting peroxide from them i do not know how safe that could be but it not very promising to me the dentist will cost more but it will be what you are really expecting save your money,0
formatting makes this book hard to read i was excited to read this free book until i received it unfortunately there is no table of contents some of the punctuation is different from the original this is distracting and slows the pace of the book everything runs together the entire book from the preface to the end reads like one chapter without a break,0
now i know why it is such a favorite i was an english lit major and never a big fan of dickens he is too long winded but this book seemed too short it not that i felt that it was incomplete i just enjoyed it so much that i wanted more do yourself a favor and read it at christmas time i did,1
wasnt what i expected my family has a history of dyslexia so comic books are hard to read so when my mother told me that had a christmas carol batman classic for sale i was thrilled needless to say there was no batman and i wasted my time and money wondering when we were going to see the caped crusader kicking ebeneezers arse,0
short to the point dover thrift editions of charles dickens christmas classic a christmas carol is short and to the point my kind of book the world over knows the premise of dickens classic but especially at this time of year is a story most people will enjoy reading again the slim NUMBER pages makes it possible to share this story with a love one in less than an hour puts even the most hateful love one in the holiday spirit,1
poorly done e book beware this edition contains all sorts of unmappable punctuation resulting in irritating replacement characters appearing in place of every apostrophe,0
maybe good but definitely not the unabridged recording once again ok it does not happen that often otherwise we would stop trusting amazon and shopping with them we the description is not accurate this version isbn NUMBER monterey media etc is an adaptation of dicken novel by the st charles players who record it with all due talent and spirit but as a play in an exciting radio theater style quote unquote,0
a choppily abridged carol although the artwork in this book is great readers should be warned that the text is a heavy handed abridgement of charles dickens wonderful little novel it omits far too much of the rich and colorful language of this stirring novelette,0
couldn NUMBER t put it down i think this book should be made compulsory reading in schools it is defiantly one of the great classics it is timeless it is still as good today as the day it was first released i have read few books that would match up to this one this book can be read by all ages and by people in all warps off life and can be enjoyed by all i would recommend this book to any one and hope that all have the satisfaction of reading it,1
loving a christmas carol this audio version of a christmas carol was great the narrator voice s were very interesting it matched right along with the version of the book i used for my english class we enjoyed the story and enjoyed the narrator classic telling of this classic story,1
it was a good book and a short book too it was a good book i finished it in NUMBER days it was very very very short and i loved the movie,1
a dickens of a story i had seen various movie versions and knew the story well however it was fun just to read dickens original,1
excellent classic it was great to read this classic once again read it years ago and forgot how great especially around the holidays,1
great classic very well developed characters and fabulous description make mr dickens such a great writer well worth the time on a cold winter night,1
vocabulary the only thin i had trouble with us the language and vocabulary other than that it a very good christmas story,1
well written yes you already know the story if you have ever seen any of the infinite number of movies made about this story any time in the last NUMBER years you all ready know what happens so why read the book why because it is written humorously and beautifully the characters are written so well that you can relate to all of them and feel acutely what ever the writer wants you to feel toward them it is also one of dicken shorter reads,1
great edition of a christmas carol love robert ingpen illustrations they work so well for this story in particular as far as i can tell this is not abridged either which is a huge plus if you want an edition of a christmas carol on your shelf this is definitely a good one,1
the book showed true family values i liked charles dickens the christmas carol because it had lots of class dickens wrote about something and now you read it to your grandchildren on christmas eve it something that the whole family will enjoy i know my family does,1
holiday classic this is a good lesson learned book and brings to mind in reading the importance of sharing with joy all should learn from this book s message,1
a holiday classic a good read for the christmas holidays a little wordy at times though but that expected with the period it was written in it definitely gives you a glimpse into NUMBER th century london and how tough life was,1
always a good read as fun to read as to watch while not the true christmas story it certainly captures the spirit of christmas and the effects of living one christmas faith in the incarnate lord jesus,1
not as great as the other seasons still missing dana it was great seeing her ghost in one episode i find that the NUMBER th season was not as good as the previous ones i love all the characters but i did not like shane moving on so quickly with paige she seem to be more the person that carmen wanted but without carmen,1
total waste of time it not often that i diametrically oppose another person opinion but i thought this book was terrible i read about NUMBER pages and tossed it the writing is very stilted and its just not a comfortable read heroine aggie is so full of start that she just no likeable even in the love scenes,0
worst macbeth ever first you can watch this train wreck for free through google video second find it and watch the ending just so you see brett ridiculous macbeth costume his tights look like cheap ill fitting long underwear with the crotch almost down to his knees this is during the final scenes where he spits death in the eye so it pretty hysterical with the fakey swords being waved around it brings to mind children horsing around in the backyard,0
too much in this madness method actress piper laurie made me laugh out loud when she began the come you spirits speech as if she were trying to summon blanche dubois and medea in one go can not imagine mr brett excuse for as abysmally poor acting for even worse shakespearean acting and yes it not the same as playing any other texts see two star trekkers ohura and the russian guy and a general hospital star luke in this series antony and cleopatra not a larfing matter in the end,0
book a sailors valentine by john fondas great purchase i was thrilled to finally receive my book the sailors valentine it a unique book about an old art using shells the sailors of a century and more ago created the valentines for their sweethearts the pictures are fantastic and the octagon shape of the book makes it a perfect table book i could not find this out of print book anywhere but on amazon com i received it in it original sealed box it was new listed in the used book section thanks amazon,1
one star may be too much hack writing at its laziest seriously i can not fathom that people gush over this book essentially what identity crisis was supposed to be was a for the dc universe stable of characters however in a world of telepaths sorcerers and men who shoot laser beams out of their eyes it falls embarrassingly flat on its face meltzer composes a story full of plot holes bad characterization and enough tired cliches to make any true fan of the genre wince quite possibly the only good comment i could make is that the artist is quite talented other than that not a lot to recommend,0
replacement blades at a reasonable price these replacement blades worked great when i needed to repair my alienfly after flying it into the wall too many times,1
good read and easy to understand this book does not contain mathematical formula which is a plus for me the explanation on how a statistic can be misunderstood or misrepresent in simple english it is helpful because i can spot more loopholes in statistics now on the other hand if a need arises i can use these methods to mislead people,1
tiesto your mix and track selection is bad i seriously do not think this cd deserves the avg rating it has got this has got to be the worst in search of sunrise series by the so called NUMBER dj tiesto the very first song when crossfading with the second is patchy which means he can not get the basics right of beat matching he could have at least perfected it in the studio before the release i am sure everyone who bought the cd agrees also there is no proper direction in the music the tunes are not catchy they are really boring and sounds like someone is learning to play the keyboard except coca villa la noche even the vocal tunes here are horrible tiesto has lost my vote for the top dj poll paul van dyk was always NUMBER for me and will always be i regret buying this cd and am depressed with the current state of trance music only paul van dyk can cure me with his politics of dancing NUMBER cd,0
it first european trip was a success q we bought this product as a gift for our friends to assist them in their NUMBER th anniversary trip to europe in their return one of the first things they said was how practical and how useful their gps was in europe especially in england apparently at practicality and ease of use departments it beat the in dash product that came with their luxury automobile sounds like we picked the right product for the right purpose,1
beware of cost of updates opnly one free update offered i purhcased the nuvi NUMBER from amazon several weeks ago and i was hapy with the unit until i checked to see if there were map updates avaialable from garmin garmin website stated that map updates were available for europe and north america but only one update was free so i spent all this money on a international gps unit only to end up with one map being out of date when i received the unit it had a NUMBER maps for europe and NUMBER maps fo north america there were updated versions of both maps available but i would have to pay for one of them the cheap one costing close to NUMBER usd i contacted garmin on several different occasions and they stood by their policy of only offering one free map update what a disappointment with this supposively good company you buy a gps and it does not even come with the latest maps i am very disappointed ron,0
a lot for the money since the NUMBER is a discontinued model the price reduction on amazon was tremendous for less than NUMBER you get the following features spoken street names although they often indistinguishable via computerized voices bluetooth cell phone reception with a bluetooth phone which works very well fm traffic monitor of limited usefulness us canada european maps relative up to date for the latest maps you get one updated map free and the other must be purchased car a separate home recharger front window mount close to NUMBER million poi car truck motorcylce walking modes one way point before end destination old style flip antenna instead of built in very bright screen speaker could be louder i took the unit on a recent trip and it was at least NUMBER accurate with recent within the year roads and freeways often not given highly recommended,1
garmin nuvi NUMBER review i have had a garmin quest for many years and have used it throughout the u s and europe on many trips i bought the nuvi NUMBER for my other cars it has improved antenna sensitivity to work better in a city environment pre loaded u s and european maps clearer and enhanced voice instructions as well as blue tooth and other features make this a really enjoyable and useful product,1
you can never go wrong with bugs and company having grown up with bugs bunny i am pleased to see they are still going my son laughs out loud when we watch it,1
excellent book for practice when i purchased this book i hoped that it would help me improve my sat score it has helped my improve my score but lacked some of the tricks that i had expected to find in it this book offers a great amount of practice problems and excellent explanations but it gives very little information about some of the test taking tips that other books give so if you are looking for a book that gives you a lot of practice with verbal problems this books is excellent however if you hope to find tricks of the trade in this book look somewhere else because this book gives very minimal,1
clear structure good vocab list the vocabulary list contained in this book goes on for NUMBER pages and contains about NUMBER words since last month i have taken the challenge to memorize them all everyday i also took one of the NUMBER or so question sets NUMBER analogy NUMBER fill in NUMBER reading by now i am NUMBER NUMBER of the way finished this contributed greatly to the increase of my verbal score to NUMBER from NUMBER on the practice sat test besides i also have hot words for sat NUMBER and the barron guide this is because one book does not offer enough practices getting a couple books is also advantagous because the varying teaching styles makes the task of memorization less monotonous,1

a terrible destruction of beautiful music by a great compose being that i was born in a latin american country listening to these tunes original versions i can safely say that mr veloso representation of them are the weakest that i have ever had the mispleasure of listening and i am a great admirer of mr veloso works in his native portuguese,0
repetitive repetitive repetitive repetitive how many times can you say the same thing just ask gordon before you waste your money on this,0
new battery behaves like used one i bought a new battery but it is behaving like a used battery the battery live does not last more than NUMBER days when not in use,0
not oem product given the variance in reviews at best i say this is an unreliable product i saw the mixed reviews before ordering but figured they could not be that bad first of all the battery was not a bb battery not as pictured nor made in japan it was plain silver and made in china the battery i received would not hold a charge for more than a couple of hours i sent an e mail complaint was told that sometimes a given battery will not be up to snuff and they would exchange the second battery lasted a little longer but not even NUMBER hours i gave up i had made a bad bet i just did not want to bother with them any more i used it for a couple of months having to charge it once or twice a day it declined steadily and finally flat lined this week ironically i am now using my old battery which seems brilliant compared to my recent experiences maybe you will get lucky but the odds are against you,0
NUMBER battery i did not do a scientific study but i do not think the new battery that i received holds more or longer charge than my worn out NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER year old battery when i got the battery it looked a bit beat i called and they assured me that it is new the person said that the batteries ship bulk in a bag and they get beat up i am not thrilled with the performance i am skeptical and will not do it again can not recommend it,0
rating the actual book not its wonderful content this huge collector edition is heavy the font is small and there is a ridiculous amount of margin area for writing i take copious notes but this is even too much for me so in effect you buy this supposedly beautifuly collector edition but it shiny paper back what so great about it nothing i am not even sure why it costs so much i have seen numerous errors in spelling the value does not equal what you pay for it go for the lighter editions unless like other reviewers you buy this merely to sit on your shelf to impress people or yourself as for the book adam smith is thorough it hard work to get through it but his principles are sound and when left to work without government regulation the precepts taught therein work beautifully smith gets five stars the premium edition is lucky to get two,0
bad edition i would not buy this edition the printing is terribly small its about half the size of normal print and there is no introduction usually these types of works have some sort of preface which introduces the reader to the material,0
beware no NUMBER th book the everyman library version is abridged without being advertised as so either on amazon or anywhere inside the book the wealth of nations is a pivotal work in the history of economics and human nature but you be better off finding an edition that includes the entire work the wealth of nations everyman library,0
essential reading this is in my top NUMBER best books of all time i give it an a it is a very long read that covers a broad range of information involving economics but well worth the time spent there are a lot of references to issues that were occurring during smith time that may not seem to be pertinent to the reader but can still be applied to modern times i most enjoyed the last sections of the book on taxes and public debts his NUMBER maxims of taxes are that they should be equal certain convenient and beneficial he viewed inflation as extremely pernicious the book contains ideas that americans should possibly revisit in the near future,1
smokey and the bandit pursuit pack the quality of this NUMBER movie dvd was terrible the first movie froze up near the end even after i attempted to play it in a second player the NUMBER nd movie did not play at all and the third one which played perfectly was a waste of time the original smokey and the bandit was true comedy genius and jackie gleason portrayal of sheriff buford t justice was one of his very best burt reynolds sally field and jerry reed were dynamite together and jerry reed east bound and down song topped a great comedy its too bad the NUMBER nd movie did not play because i thought this one was nearly as good as the first the NUMBER rd installment lacked good writing and seemed just plain empty without burt reynolds and sally field smokey and the bandit pursuit pack,0
burt reynolds it came very fast and the quality is very good would buy from this seller again if they anything that i want thanks,1
diehard fans wondering about the b side well if you missed this import single when it was released along with a handful more you may fear you missed an andy bell gem this track is a b side for a reason totally inferior to anything on the full length cd no it not an electro house dance track like much of what you will find on the full length it a short sort of campy cabaret style track that uses what sounds like a real band including acoustic drums guitar and even a horn section if you simply must have everything andy bell sings then you do get plenty of his vocal but if you are really more just about his classic dance sound then pass on it ashame they could not have just thrown it in as a bonus track on the domestic maxi single release of crazy,0

old school action movie i agree with the other reviewers that this is an entertaining action movie as long as your suspend most of your belief in reality i do what to point out that the machine gun he shoots is a browning NUMBER caliber not a NUMBER caliber the gun was meant to shot from a tripod but it could be shot from the hip he does run out of bullets for it and his handguns as for the rocket launcher part i am sorry the explosion back blast would have killed all three of them in the room when it went off,1

the masterpiece of american song perhaps the best thing to say about this songbook is what ira gershwin said after hearing it i did not realize how good our songs george and ira gershwin were until i heard ella sing them in these songbooks she is at her mature best her voice is smooth elegant clear beautifully nuanced rich in range remarkable it is sheer joy to listen to her in the very best of the songs while many prefer the drive and rhythm of ellington i myself prefer the more lyrical and slower swinging pieces but what is important is that this is a great masterpiece which presents the great works of the american songook in the best way possible one can listen to these songs again and again and doing so brings only greater pleasure,1
where struggle ends and grace begins i first read this book when i had to write an existential paper for one of my counseling classes it was difficult for me to understand at first but i read it again and it changed my life in ways so many times we look at god and box him her into compartments when we do this we think we have a good handle on who and what god is then as time goes on and we evolve our thoughts on god no longer relate or apply to our lives through the struggle to know seek and experience god we many times are disappointed when god and ourselves do not connect paul tillich tells us that through the struggle we must have absolute faith and the god who is really god appears in grace,1

it does not really do it this work has much interesting information but i do not think it truly defines the mind i have the sense that the jewish mind if we consider its creations from biblical time to now is simply too vast and varied for easy definition i would too say that as jews value the idea of creation their own mind is in a constant process of development and creation any summary then seems to be a simple reduction and not true to the reality,1

a decent well acted NUMBER minute movie i had seen this movie on tv way back in NUMBER on a local pbs station i had not seen it since then so when i got this dvd recently i was really looking forward to seeing it again i remembered how well acted this movie was it is a very good movie however i noticed that some of the dialogue seemed a little forced in certain parts you could tell that the actors were reading scripted lines this only happened in a couple places other than that all the other dialogue was rendered in a natural and effective way this movie is quite sad and the actors really bring that across you can sense their pain and hurt as they work through the anguish of andre death this is a very good movie and very short well worth the investment,1
good fun though not the strongest in the series more good fun from chester himes on the plus side he finally includes some entertaining sex on the other hand one of the main bad guys here the colonel is particularly flat and unbelievable also as usual the end is much less satisfying than the ride to get there,1

hex wrenches i have used this brand previously at work and have had good luck with them the coating holds up to daily use and abuse,1
best film about art and the artist ever i try to watch this movie once a year it is a gorgeous slow moving thing the better part of the movie is taken up with the battle between frehofer and the form he is trying to bring to life on the canvas with emmanuelle beart as his model he gives up she gives up but they plow on through the story is unsullied by any erotic or at least overtly erotic connection between the two but there is none of the neurotic histrionics and unrequited sacrifices of the usual films about artist there is just the hard greuling work of having a vision and getting it right this is freely based on the story the unknown masterpiece by balzac if only more movies freely based on a story could be as fine as this one knowing the story which is a short novella may actually add to the appreciation of the film and the character of frenhofer,1
mish this is a hilarious album with all the favourite aspects of the prairie home companion show garrison keillor could read the phone book and it would be funny,1
garrison keillor need anyone say more it a full hour of a prairie home companion not just the best bits from various shows the version of the small church struggle to find a musical director seems different from the one i have on another cd but it all delightful great way to spend an hour while driving in the country warning do not attempt to operate vehicle in town or under complicated road conditions while listening to any phc cd these require some brainwork and i have almost driven off the road laughing a couple of times,1

an old favorite i fondly remember this book that i read as a child over fifty years ago i was looking for a way to address issues about manners with my five year old grandson and rediscovered this book he clearly got the messages leaf imparted and thoroughly enjoyed it the author did an excellent job of succicntly and imaginatively presenting the rules of getting along with others and the consequences of not doing so the terminology and pictures leaf used to describe poorly mannered children was indelibly printed in my mind and has lost none of its charm,1
help me oh my gosh i f you are looking for an interesting book to read do not read treasure island it is totally on a reading level for way older people not NUMBER th graders i had to read this book in class and it was so hard to understand that i gave up and fell asleep boring book i would not even classify it as a classic i would classify it as a good way to put yourself to sleep,0
stevenson best this book is the best book i have ever read i have already read this book NUMBER times and i will read it much more in my lifetime stevenson blends adventure and intrigue splendidly in this fast paced novel about a young boy who receives a treasure map from an old buccaneer and his adventures afterward hawkins the boy meets up with salty pirates and finds good friends in the captain and doctor i would reccomend that anyone who loves a good book and an exciting thrill should definately read this,1
a treasure this is an authentic masterpiece by the author of dr jekyll and mr hyde which tells a story of pirates in search of a treasure hidden in an island dr jekyll is very different a strange puzzling mysterious symbolic story the characters in treasure island are unforgettable jim hawkins dr livesey captain smollet john silver the man without a leg who disappears in latin america and the pirate flint a character who is always present but only through the dialogues this is a classic but a cult novel as well,1
review of treasure island stevenson treasure island is remarkably well written containing fascinating bits of foreshadowing a unique and captivating plot and undying characters that will burn into your mind indefinitely my personal favorite character is long john silver who throughout the novel seems almost schitzofranic his one side is well mannered charming and witty while his other face is ruthless sly and money driven in part one the old buccaneer the strange new pirate pays jim hawkins a gold piece daily to watch out for a one legged man hobbling down the street this is truly good almost humorous foreshadowing the ending is perfectly crafted by stevenson it closes with jim hawkins describing his predictions for the destinies of the pirates he has traveled with thank you robert louis stevenson for contributing one of literatures most amazing works,1
treasure island i read this year ago and loved it then i enjoyed reading it again wonderful book this was the first book i read on my kindle awesome,1
treasure island i thought that treasure island was a very good exciting book and it made me want to read there were some parts that were not as interesting as others and they needed some excitment and at these parts i did not think that i was going to like the book but by the end i did not want it to be over i thought it was very exciting how they were on the island with all these pirates and how they were both going after the same thing the treasue adding new characters and taking away some of the old ones death was also a part of how it made it interesting over all it is a very good book and i advise people of all ages to read it,1
