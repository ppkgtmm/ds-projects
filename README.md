# Pinky's Data Science Projects :seedling:

Having an interest in data science and machine learning with some prior knowledge, I spend some time to do data related side projects of which Jupyter Notebooks 
are stored in this repository.

Let me walk you through the repo structure

* deep-learning - used to store deep learning related projects
  * MNIST sign language classification - applied CNN to do image classification using F1 score as model selection metric
  * sentiment analysis - implemented text data cleaning function and constructed sentiment detectors using Naive Bayes and LSTM
  * variational autoencoder - built vae neural networks for image generation using customized loss functions
* machine-learning - mostly comprised of machine learning work
  * house price estimation - imputed data and emsembled regression models to approximate price of houses
  * customer clustering - utilized clustering methods to group wholesale customers and visualized the results
  * churn prediction - performed analysis of data and applied classification algorithms to categorize customers
  * e-commerce customer spending regression - carried out regression analysis of customer annual spending
* others - this directory contains projects that belongs to data analysis and visualization categories
  * youtube trending video data analysis - cleaned, visualized and analysed 100k+ records of data
  * thailand covid-19 dashboard - set up to get daily updates from Thailand's Open Government Data API and visualized data
