# Pinky's Data Science Projects :seedling:

### Hello and welcome to the repository of my data science journey 👋🏻

Having an interest in data science and machine learning with some prior knowledge, I find some time to do data related side projects of which Jupyter Notebooks 
are stored in this repository.

I also have taken some online courses related to data science and machine learning but being able to apply the knowledge learnt i.e. doing projects, makes me more confident that what I learnt is useful to someone.

I am planning to do project related to both machine learning and deep learning :robot:. Some examples of my projects are
- American Sign Language recognition ✊🏻 <br/>
  An image classification task using Convolutional Neural Network and data augmentation technique which gained more than 99 % accuracy on test set. This project could be a part in improving ability to interpret sign langauge of people unfamiliar to it.
- House price prediction 🏠 <br/>
  House price estimation project in which feature engineering and proper missing value imputation are conducted to increase model performance. The final model has resulted in RMSLE of ~0.12 on test set. Models from this project can guide home owners towards suitable house price according to house attributes.
