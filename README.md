# Pinky's Data Science Projects :seedling:

Hello and welcome to the repository of my data science journey :wave:

Having an interest in data science and machine learning with prior little knowledge, I find some time to do data related side projects of which Jupyter Notebooks

I also have taken some online courses related to data science and machine learning but doing projects to apply knowledge learnt, makes remember the concepts better.

I am planning to do project related to both machine learning and deep learning :robot: Some examples of my projects are
